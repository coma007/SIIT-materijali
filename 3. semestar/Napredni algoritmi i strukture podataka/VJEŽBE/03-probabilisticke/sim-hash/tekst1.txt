Like all forests, the wooded stretches of the Arctic sometimes catch on fire. But unlike many forests in the mid-latitudes, which thrive on or even require fire to preserve their health, Arctic forests have evolved to burn only infrequently.
Climate change is reshaping that regime. In the first decade of the new millennium, fires burned 50 percent more acreage each year in the Arctic, on average, than any decade in the 1900s. Between 2010 and 2020, burned acreage continued to creep up, particularly in Alaska, which had its second worst fire year ever in 2015 and another bad one in 2019. Scientists have found that fire frequency today is higher than at any time since the formation of boreal forests some 3,000 years ago, and potentially higher than at any point in the last 10,000 years.
Fires in boreal forests can release even more carbon than similar fires in places like California or Europe, because the soils underlying the high-latitude forests are often made of old, carbon-rich peat. In 2020, Arctic fires released almost 250 megatons of carbon dioxide, about half as much as Australia emits in a year from human activities and about 2.5 times as much as the record-breaking 2020 California wildfire season.
