5,4,Cartman,"Oh, nothing. No big deal, really.
"
2,4,Stan,"Naturally.
"
5,5,Cartman,"Kyle, none of this would be happening if you hadn't LIED in the first place! You lied, and then you lied to cover up your lie!
"
16,9,Stan,"You find a good catcher's mitt, Cartman?
"
11,14,Wendy,"This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.
"
11,5,Kyle,"I don't see it.
"
1,4,Cartman,"Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.
"
12,10,Cartman,"There's no talking to this guy.
"
16,1,Randy,"Aw, you people have me on camera now?
"
12,9,Wendy,"I can't fight you because you came crying to my house last night with your mom!
"
6,13,Kyle,"No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before.
"
1,7,Kyle,"Wow! Cool!
"
3,1,Stan,"Help ...him?
"
5,1,Kyle,"Hey you guys! Look what I have!
"
6,3,Butters,"I'm sorry, but the answer is un uh, uh uh, uh uh. 
"
14,10,Randy,"Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?
"
3,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well, hell, turn it up.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Everything's great, Mom.  No! Come back here and flush the toilet, you silly! Noohoho! 
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, baby, I'm sorry.
"
13,11,Kenny,"(I would do anything!) 
"
2,15,Stan,"Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
"
13,5,Cartman,"No, no. Polacks aren't that funny dude. Try somethin' else. 
"
6,13,Butters,"It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
"
11,14,Wendy,"No. Not Bebe.
"
2,5,Cartman,"Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"What?!
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"No! No excuses! You have a problem bein' jelly, Wendy! Okay?! Just maybe, I should have you sent off to jelly school!
"
3,3,Cartman,"So, what does that mean?
"
12,4,Butters,"I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt 
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt? 
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
It's okay
Ih-if you have a little fight
Don't you worry
I won't bite (Not that hard)
If you want it
I'll give you power
Just be gentle
I'm delicate like a flower
Give it to me, if you please
Give it to me, if you please
"
2,18,Kyle,"Kenny, who found the ice man?
"
15,10,Wendy,"You like looking at girls' butt cracks, Stan?!
"
2,8,Stan,"But Cartman, we're trying to--
"
5,14,Stan,"Damn, dude.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Thank me by living, Butters. Live. And... rebuild.  I've got to go. Remember, wait one week for the toxic levels to go down. On Saturday.  G-goodbye!  All right. Just six days, Butters. Sit tight.
"
3,8,Randy,"Yeah. Hey uh, if you watch another guy masturbate, does that make you gay?
"
2,18,Kyle,"Oh.
"
11,4,Kyle,"What?
"
7,7,Stan,"We just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars! 
"
6,11,Randy,"Good-bye, kids. We'll... never forget you. 
"
16,12,Stan,"What the hell?  Shelly I need to use your cell phone.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Noo. Don't you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What's to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they'll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.
"
13,3,Cartman,"And where has all the money gone? It must have gone somewhere! The answer is obvious, my friends! It is the Jews! Covetous Jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves! Hidden all the cash in some... secret Jew cave that they built, probably back in the early 60s! It is the Jews, my friends, who are oft...
"
14,1,Cartman,"Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time.
"
6,9,Kyle,"Well then we're gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song.
"
8,13,Cartman,"It is fried chicken!  Oh my God. It's a fried chicken sundae.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Aw man, did you see the look on Craig's face?! That was awesome!
"
1,1,Cartman,"You guys, I am seriously getting pissed off right now! I know there is no such things as aliens!  Oh, God damn it!
"
9,6,Cartman,"They can't hurt me, Butters. I'm already dead. 
"
1,7,Wendy,"Hi guys.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
4,13,Kyle,"I will!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Yeah! We can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit.
"
7,1,Stan,"I remember this whole thing.  Ike tried to follow you to school. You kicked him, then Cartman told us about his alien dream.
"
8,13,Kyle,"Awww, go on and do it already!
"
10,4,Cartman,"Seeya.
"
3,5,Stan,"Sshh! Be quit. We could get in big trouble for being here.
"
5,13,Kenny,"(Eric, well you're my best friend, too.)
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, who can tell me what a condom is?  Yes, Jenny?
"
8,9,Kyle,"Butters? What the hell are you doing?
"
6,11,Randy,"Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! We have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town!
"
5,5,Stan,"They're back!
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Now, young man, uh- school is a time for learning, mkay? Not for immature skylarkings.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Jambu? Jambu?  Cool! It worked! Hey, Jambu.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Guys, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure!  For that is the way of the--
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike!  Wait! '
"
3,8,Butters,"Upstairs? Uhwhy why there's ain't nothin' upstairs but adults. Uhwhy would we want to go upstairs for?
"
12,11,Cartman,"Dude, this is boring. This is just a bunch of walking around.
"
12,8,Cartman,"It's already started. White people in here working for the Chinese. They're selling out their own country!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Oh, pretty good, except I had the weirdest dream last night.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Yeah, well people should  know that peeing in pools is  bad!
"
7,15,Stan,"What?
"
18,8,Stan,"Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.
"
3,8,Randy,"I'm just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub.
"
15,1,Kyle,"It's crazy, dude! They're saying it's because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes!
"
4,13,Kyle,"Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!
"
9,3,Kyle,"Probably.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Yeah, fatass! Get your fat butt on the sled!
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"That's the fifth family of them that's moved here. Seems like all of a sudden South Park is being overrun by those types.
"
18,3,Stan,"Wha-wait, Lorde sounds like a girl.
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, watch it, fag.
"
17,9,Kenny,"Tadaima! 
"
13,9,Butters,"And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. 
"
8,9,Kyle,"Who are you?
"
15,14,Kyle,"My name. Is not. ""Kyel.""
"
6,13,Randy,"I love that lingerie.  Yeah. You like that?
"
9,9,Butters,"You think I'm ugly-ehehee...
"
11,1,Randy,"Oh naggers. Of course, naggers.  Right.
"
4,17,Stan,"E mouths...
"
1,6,Kyle,"But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.
"
2,4,Cartman,"Eech.  Wait a minute! No, you wouldn't!
"
14,1,Cartman,"Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. 
"
8,2,Jimmy,"The Games are in two days, Nancy. I can't be w-wasting my time.
"
13,2,Cartman,"So, guys! Any of you do anything interesting last night?!
"
4,10,Stan,"Now, let's see. What about the time we set Mr. Garrison's cat on fire?
"
1,13,Stan,"Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!
"
7,11,Butters,"But I can't see nothin'.
"
7,1,Cartman,"This is like my fifth time. 
"
9,14,Stan,"This is sooo embarrassing.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Oh, come on, Token! Your new house is four times the size of anyone else's in town! And who else gets crab cakes and, and lobster tail in their lunch boxes?!
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Okay Bebe, this is your line.
"
14,2,Stan,"Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
"
13,9,Butters,"Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.
"
3,12,Stan,"All we have to do is sneak in the graveyard, dig her up, scare the fifth graders, then put her back before anyone notices she's gone,
"
15,13,Kyle,"Would you guys stop!
"
18,9,Stan,"What are you talking about?
"
13,13,Cartman,"No, because it turns out that by rule, the student body president can't also be the morning announcement reader!
"
4,11,Kyle,"You're keeping that money yourself?
"
7,7,Randy,"Dammit!
"
6,12,Stan,"Did you get it? 
"
8,3,Stan,"Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You've gotta go faster.
"
13,2,Cartman,"Fuckin' butthole!
"
13,5,Butters,"Eric and Jimmy came up with the funniest joke ever.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, I want everyone to stay together, m'kay? Nobody move!
"
4,10,Stan,"Okay, you'd better baptize Kyle some more.
"
12,7,Wendy,"Look, Stan, they had beef jerky back then.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
"
9,14,Randy,"I'm sorry, son! I'm off the wagon!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Stupid assholes!  How come nobody has a crime to solve?
"
5,5,Stan,"Come on, Kenny, hurry up!
"
13,5,Cartman,"It's cool man, it's cool. 
"
6,16,Cartman,"I'm a professional, suh!  Don't worry about it, Butters. You're gonna be a hundred percent satisfied.
"
7,6,Stan,"Hey, you owe us a dollar, lady.
"
14,5,Stan,"I saw him once. 
"
14,5,Randy,"Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo.
"
3,2,Randy,"You wanted to see me, Mayor?
"
9,11,Cartman,"That's right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!
"
2,4,Kyle,"Meaning what?
"
2,9,Kyle,"Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass. 
"
6,7,Butters,"Aaah! Ah, Ah, Aaah! Nooo! Nooo!
"
2,13,Kyle,"That does it! Shenanigans!  SHENANIGANS!
"
11,5,Stan,"You said ""hand over the bunny.""
"
8,1,Kenny,"(Yeah! Take this, Professor Chaos!)  (Feel my wrath!) 
"
16,11,Butters,"He won't betray us! Will you, Kenny?!
"
2,9,Kenny,"(Wait!) 
"
2,14,Stan,"You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we're not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It's gonna be her choice who she likes the most.
"
4,17,Cartman,"Oh, sorry, you might get some germs while you're walking around in human feces!
"
11,9,Stan,"So?
"
1,12,Cartman,"WAAAGH! Damn your black heart, Barbra Streisand!
"
7,6,Stan,"You got it, Ken? 
"
15,5,Kyle,"And so, thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with EA Sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies. Did you see the blueprints? The babies will have their own putt putt golf course.  Why does it matter how much I'm making, Stan? If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?
"
13,10,Kyle,"I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!
"
10,11,Cartman,"I am not!
"
14,7,Jimmy,"If you get in a pinch, go through, it's a cinch-
"
16,6,Cartman,"Hey yeah, ziplining! That could be really cool!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Hoh, this should get some comments. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"Aw,  Jesus Christ!
"
5,3,Stan,"You said we're free to leave whenever we want
"
9,7,Cartman,"Dude, you don't just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Let's just get back to cheering, okay?!
"
10,4,Cartman,"You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened.  First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility.  Ow..
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, really nice, Mike, uh, maybe next time you can get past the first word. Oh, Casey Miller, good, you're trying out too?
"
9,13,Cartman,"He hasn't said a word since we brought him here.
"
3,14,Randy,"Let's bring those Confederate bastards down! 
"
5,1,Cartman,"I'm sure they're just holding it 'til the very last scene.
"
2,3,Kyle,"Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical. 
"
6,11,Stan,"Dude, sometimes I think our parents are really stupid.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"No, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. It's over! Ike is class president!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Then maybe I can make myself believe it too.  Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. 
"
16,9,Kyle,"We should not be wasting time and money making sure Cartman's fat scooter can't be tipped over!
"
16,13,Stan,"...I don't know.  I like it.
"
10,9,Kyle,"So you blamed the government?!
"
13,12,Cartman,"Oh yeah, nice, Kenny. 
"
4,1,Kyle,"Well then,  you've got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive Cartman for being a dumbass!
"
2,4,Stan,"Ahhh, bicycles?
"
7,10,Cartman,"I think I have a plan, though we'll have to do it tonight.  We'll start by sneaking into town, cleverly disguised as black people.  At 5:45 Kenny and Kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town.  Meanwhile, Stan and I sneak into the Mayor's office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed. Nine o'clock: we rendezvous at the Country Kitchen Buffet, where we strap the explosives and the timer to Kyle's chest. We say our tearful goodbyes to Kyle, and then we send him inside. 
"
7,14,Butters,"When do you wanna see me?
"
2,12,Stan,"Okay. We're done.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Yeah Token, that's the law! Everything inside the red line is lava.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Yep.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Dude! You're still alive, Cartman?
"
8,4,Randy,"It isn't on. Nothing's on. It's off.
"
17,8,Butters,"You mean Princess Kenny, m'lord?
"
1,3,Cartman,"Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.
"
17,2,Randy,"Will do, officer. Will... do... 
"
2,3,Stan,"Look! 
"
18,10,Cartman,"What the hell?!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Aw, you're just like the government, man! Trying to prosecute outta one side of your mouth, m'kay, while supporting guns outta the other, m'kay?
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh God, oh God!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Don't try and make me feel better, you guys, it isn't... Wait, wait a minute. Why would you guys be saying stuff to make me feel better? Unless... unless you do think I'm cool. 
"
8,8,Randy,"Jesus. I guess maybe you'll never understand how important voting is.  Goodbye, Son.  That's... one of the hardest things a parent ever has to do.
"
15,2,Cartman,"Hör zu, diese ganze Dinge ist ein Fehler. 
"
13,4,Butters,"Oh. Hey fellas.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Destroy it?
"
9,10,Stan,"I can't. I'm busy.
"
4,11,Kenny,"(Where am I?)
"
11,7,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
18,6,Kyle,"You just push it on other people?!
"
1,13,Mr. Garrison,"You're drunk, Mr. Hat! 
"
1,11,Stan,"I think so.
"
16,4,Cartman,"All I can promise you is that this is going to be the most memorable Passover ever.  ""Cartman's Passover Holiday Special"", starring, THE JEWPACABRA! 
"
7,10,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, can I help you folks find something?  Oowww! 
"
4,15,Cartman,"Whoa! That totally surprised me!  I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.
"
1,3,Randy,"Well, this graph shows everything from normal to bad.  Right now South Park is here.
"
12,10,Stan,"Don't worry you guys. I'm sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us.
"
9,2,Stan,"Dude, these people have no idea what's going on. Let's get out of here.
"
15,7,Randy,"Yeah it, it doesn't sound like that to us.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Spearheaded by you, m'kay, made him feel there was no other way out.
"
7,13,Cartman,"So, heh gentlemen, looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial, huh? Who will it be...? Gentlemen, the game is on!
"
16,1,Kyle,"All right, you see, Clyde. Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Nah-ah! I'm just a better debater than you guys!
"
10,2,Kyle,"Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
"
12,6,Randy,"We're gonna head west. There's a rumor goin' around there might be some Internet out there. So we're headed out Californee Way.
"
6,8,Cartman,"I bet you twenty bucks it'll work!
"
6,3,Butters,"Hah yeah, how are we go-? Wait... Butters' chin?
"
11,10,Butters,"Uh, I got somethin'! I got it!  It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems.
"
14,9,Randy,"I don't really work out.
"
11,1,Randy,"An O please.
"
15,11,Randy,"Say Sharon, how would you like to go to New York for the weekend?
"
7,9,Stan,"Oh yeah.
"
4,9,Randy,"And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
"
18,6,Stan,"How?
"
1,2,Wendy,"Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!
"
6,7,Cartman,"Sea people... coming in the mail tomorrow...  Yesss... Yeesss...
"
11,2,Cartman,"That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now.  That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth.  Ow. OW. OW!
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh.  Alright, then. I-
"
11,2,Kyle,"He isn't actually going to show everyone...
"
16,9,Cartman,"Dude, I'm not fat! I don't drive around on a mobility scooter like  bitch! 
"
14,9,Stan,"Dude, what are you doing?
"
13,10,Kyle,"Let's do this! One! Two!
"
5,2,Stan,"What do we want?
"
11,10,Cartman,"Hello, Mr. Broflovski, Ike. Nice evening, isn't it? Well Kyle, shall we go up to your room for a few minutes.
"
4,9,Stan,"Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it.
"
2,10,Stan,"Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!
"
3,3,Kyle,"Shut up, Cartman!
"
7,7,Cartman,"You're all a bunch of God-damned pussies! 
"
16,13,Mr. Garrison,"Now, when Dr. Drew told Jeff Conway he was on a one-way street to nowhere, what tactics did he use to try and convince-? 
"
7,1,Stan,"Guys. Look. 
"
7,3,Kyle,"So we're not TP'ing a house with kids inside it!
"
12,3,Cartman,"Agh, Kenny! Knock it off! What's wrong with you?
"
11,2,Butters,"Wait. Now I am confused.
"
10,12,Cartman,"So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Oh fine, go on and leave! I'm gonna find out who did this to Clyde, and I'm gonna have your fuckin' balls! Fly to Christ.
"
5,1,Cartman,"Goddamn it! When are they gonna say ""shit""?!
"
6,5,Butters,"Sure! I'm good at all kinds of jobs!
"
3,12,Cartman,"Heh heh, I'm sweet.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Why can't societies just live in peace?
"
16,12,Stan,"They said they were heading to the big party at the community center. You have to stop it. My friends are in trouble.
"
10,7,Cartman,"She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes.
"
18,10,Stan,"That self-promoting asshole!
"
15,10,Cartman,"I was just thinkin' that... m-m-maybe we could... eat lunch together. I've always kind of...  liked you.
"
6,10,Kyle,"Hoh!
"
12,11,Randy,"That's a that's a, that's a new sound. 
"
7,15,Kyle,"Ike!
"
10,13,Kyle,"Aw Goddamnit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you! 
"
13,13,Butters,"Hey Eric!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
"
2,14,Kyle,"We’ll get my dad to be Chef’s lawyer!
"
7,9,Kyle,"I don't know.  Let me go check. 
"
7,1,Kyle,"I'm not putting my finger up Cartman's butt!
"
10,10,Cartman,"Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!
"
5,11,Cartman,"I... must.. fight it! Need... forty... dollars!
"
11,4,Kyle,"...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!
"
9,3,Stan,"And what does she do?
"
1,13,Cartman,"You're very welcome, Polly Prissy Pants.  Would you like some tea, Clyde Frog?
"
2,4,Stan,"Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!
"
12,1,Cartman,"So he got HIV like fifty years ago, and he's still totally fine! Magic Johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus, Kyle. I've been researching it since I got infected. If we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype, we have a chance of beating this thing, buddy.  You and me, Kyle. We can overcome our illness; I swear it to you!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Timmy and I are competing in a variety of events.
"
9,12,Stan,"I I realize that to really be a church, we can't charge people for help.
"
11,4,Kyle,"Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest.
"
11,7,Randy,"Look, Glen. We're saved. 
"
2,16,Kyle,"Do you see him?
"
6,4,Kyle,"Dude, maybe we should end this.
"
7,2,Stan,"Dude, I am so glad we stayed out of that one.
"
1,3,Cartman,"Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.
"
8,2,Cartman,"So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!
"
1,12,Kyle,"Wait. Isn't there some rule about not getting into cars with strnagers?
"
16,6,Kyle,"Me?!
"
5,13,Cartman,"Not at all, but go on. 
"
3,4,Kenny,"(I understand, dude.)
"
10,8,Kyle,"Who is this?
"
10,12,Cartman,"Where am I?
"
16,11,Kenny,"(What about me?)
"
15,8,Kyle,"It's too late for that. Things just can't go back, Stan, uh.  Ah-I'm with Cartman Burger now.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Ho ho, that's a good one, Ping Ling. Hoho. So ah where were we? Oh yes, the invasion pran.
"
7,12,Stan,"What's that?
"
3,3,Stan,"What's a succubus?
"
3,8,Butters,"Wuh, no, I'm not sure. Uh-I'm not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin' again?
"
12,10,Stan,"Yes!
"
7,10,Stan,"Dad, I'm scared.
"
6,15,Stan,"Kyle. No, Kyle! Aw crap! 
"
1,12,Kyle,"Hey! Don't try to pass it back on me, fatass!
"
12,9,Wendy,"What are you doing?! 
"
13,11,Cartman,"What do you mean? This song is sweet.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Ma'am, I need to clear out your giggling stoners and your drum-circle hippies RIGHT NOW, or soon they're gonna attract something much worse!
"
9,12,Stan,"Neither did I!
"
18,1,Kyle,"Well what the hell do we do?
"
8,11,Butters,"Huh?
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Ni- I can- I can't!  Huff. Oh man.  Gee whiz, Timmy. It looks like we have some pretty stiff competition this year.  All of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition, and I can't even get past seven ru-reps. Hoh well, that's it for me, Timmy. I'm p-p-p-pooped. I'll see you in the locker room.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Five dollars has been donated in each of your names to the Clyde Frog Foundation. Fly fly fly...
"
7,14,Stan,"Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there's gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I'd better learn to deal with it the right way.  Hey Wendy!  You're a bitch. Token?  Right here, buddy. 
"
4,7,Stan,"Dude, you can stop faking now. We got a substitute teacher.  Kyle?
"
16,9,Cartman,"Don't know what took me so long, dude. All I needed was a few extra pounds and the insurance company paid for my own private one! See? It's got a basket in front for my candy corn Oreos. 
"
7,4,Cartman,"Nonono. I've seen this work before. Just give me a second.  Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then?  Back then? Back then? Back then?  Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don't even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don't think it has anything to do with me.  With me. With... anything to do with me. With me.
"
3,7,Cartman,"I'm sorry. Did you say something, Skyler?  Agh!
"
16,11,Butters,"Oh thi-this is my friend, Kenny.
"
4,1,Butters,"On your marks! Get set! Uh-go! 
"
13,7,Cartman,"Haven't you assholes been watching the news?  Pirating is back, my friends. Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas! The stuff we've all dreamed about! And it's all happening right here:  Somalia.
"
4,3,Cartman,"You see, in America we have... log rides!  Bacon double-cheeseburgers!  Sheep-shearing contests!
"
13,14,Kyle,"I'm not getting back in the water.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Of course, dude!)
"
16,10,Randy,"You just... order stuff off of Amazon and you can't remember what?
"
6,8,Randy,"Look, I just don't think it's the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests.
"
3,5,Cartman,"God, I'm glad you guys know all these ""pooping outside"" rules!  Urgh. Come on, now.
"
8,8,Stan,"This is bullcrap, dude!
"
14,10,Kyle,"Dude. What's wrong with you?
"
9,6,Butters,"He can't! Don't you understand?!
"
8,3,Kyle,"No I'm not! God damn it Cartman, you're not gonna kill me off again!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Gawh, this is really good, Scott!
"
2,18,Stan,"Uh. Hi.
"
6,5,Kyle,"Kyle.
"
3,4,Stan,"You ready Tweek? You ready Craig? Let's get in on!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Butters!
"
1,4,Stan,"I was with my new friend, Big Gay Al. He showed me his Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, and took me on a Big Gay Boat Ride, where I learned all about the wonders of gaiety.  It's true, I'll show you.
"
16,1,Kyle,"From what?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Because if you are, it's not cool!
"
6,10,Wendy,"Oh, for Christ's sake!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Dad, there is so a tooth fairy, huh?
"
3,17,Stan,"Dude, I can't wait 'til those New Yorker kids play the brown noise and crap their pants.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people, Kyle.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Oh, God damn it!)
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"What?
"
7,6,Cartman,"Stop playing games!
"
1,11,Kyle,"No, she wasn't!
"
16,9,Cartman,"Hey Kyle, can I come in for a second?
"
18,1,Butters,"Another two dollars!
"
8,9,Kyle,"So how do we stop it?
"
12,7,Cartman,"What'd we do? We've been here the whole time.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"What? Uh who told you that?
"
12,1,Cartman,"Oh, you have HIV, huh Kyle? Guess it isn't so funny now, is it?
"
8,2,Timmy,"Haaa!  Oh, oh!  Jimmy.
"
15,10,Stan,"We only have music class on Thursday.
"
8,9,Kyle,"It would've been faster if Cartman hadn't slashed the tires!
"
6,12,Randy,"Oh God, and we told our boys they'd never reach heaven.
"
14,8,Butters,"That was fast.
"
6,13,Jimmy,"No, the video suh... the video s...tih...
"
11,7,Cartman,"City of Venice
Right by Matt's house
You can chill if you're homeless.
"
5,14,Butters,"Thaat's that's me,  Yeah. .
"
15,7,Kyle,"Oh God...
"
15,14,Kenny,"(This is Eric Cartman.)
"
13,5,Cartman,"Abebeh, abebebebebeah! We both came up with it together! You wanna know how it happened?!
"
4,14,Stan,"Where's Gobbles, Timmy?
"
10,4,Cartman,"Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.
"
6,3,Butters,"Wait! W-why does it have to be me??
"
6,16,Stan,"Oh really? Oh, okay, uh where are you located, please?  Great, uumm, can I come by tomorrow?
"
4,3,Stan,"Damn, dude, do you see how much money this place is raking in?
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Hey!)  (Hey!)
"
4,8,Wendy,"Say it'll be like this forever.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Oh, that's good. We need some more toilet paper. 
"
4,12,Stan,"Well, here we are, dude, the first day of fourth grade.
"
12,12,Mr. Garrison,"Whoa, Jesus, it's already happening. Society's breaking down!
"
12,11,Kyle,"Go look! It's all an ancient Incan prophecy.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Neato! Having older friends kicks ass, uh! You see, I've, I've really been having a tough time. I've kind of matured faster than my other friends ; we don't really relate anymore, and, and uh, alright uh, all my friends seem so childish now.
"
14,10,Stan,"Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box.
"
1,2,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?
"
7,14,Jimmy,"...Okay.  Hey uh-Wen, hey wu-Wendy. 
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Are you serious?!)
"
3,10,Stan,"Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Because I'll answer and pretend I'm talking to somebody super famous and important. When Token sees that, maybe he'll think we're legit.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Burn it down, dude! 
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike, I do! I just-
"
1,1,Stan,"Oh, don't worry about him.
"
15,6,Butters,"AAAAAAAAAAA!  AAAAAAAAAAA!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Respect my authoritah!
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Uh huh)
"
14,14,Cartman,"Lobster foam?  It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
"
11,5,Stan,"Yeah, but why?
"
9,1,Kyle,"Look, Stan, I'm finally whole! My dad is even gonna take me back down to the all-star game to see if I can try out for the team again!
"
18,8,Randy,"Alright, for this last bit I'm gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?
"
6,16,Stan,"Butters, we're running away!
"
2,18,Cartman,"I'm right here, Kyle.
"
16,12,Stan,"Blockbuster Video?
"
18,9,Kyle,"But that's all that matter now! It's just all ... and the new celebrity?
"
8,2,Cartman,"The Special Olympics? What's so special about them?
"
18,10,Stan,"Trying to find my dad. He's supposed to take me to the board game store.
"
4,16,Cartman,"Seize her! 
"
18,7,Butters,"Ahhh! Wuhhhh! Ahhh- 
"
18,3,Cartman,"Yeah sooo I'm thinking of water feature here, you know. get the sound of running water, yeah kind of Zen it out.
"
15,6,Butters,"Well alright, Watson, well let's find out what we need to and get out of here!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Hey, dudes.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Oh, sweet, dude. Substitute teacher.
"
5,10,Butters,"I'm not wearin' makeup Dad! I uh-
"
14,10,Butters,"Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this.  I'm like a mailman. 
"
11,6,Stan,"These guys are pretty good.
"
11,5,Cartman,"Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!
"
17,2,Randy,"I can't afford DirecTV.
"
18,6,Randy,"What are you gaywads doin'?
"
10,10,Kyle,"Well they're doing it!
"
3,16,Stan,"No. I didn't, but-
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"Aw, that's so sweet, m'kay?
"
15,11,Randy,"Ooof. 
"
1,11,Wendy,"You heard me! Stay away from my man, bitch, or I'll whup your sorry little ass back to last year!  Bye, Ms. Ellen.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Timmy and I made a ...T-shirt design for our new club.  We just came up with a name this morning. 
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples.
"
4,3,Kyle,"Oh, yeah!
"
1,9,Kyle,"Shut up, Cartman!
"
4,7,Stan,"But you only need one, fat boy!
"
8,6,Cartman,"Yeah?
"
14,7,Kyle,"We're here for Towelie, fatass!
"
15,10,Stan,"Do you know why a gerbil is running around hacking our phone calls and putting our secrets up on the Internet?
"
6,10,Cartman,"Pleeeeease???
"
6,17,Stan,"We brought Christmas to Iraq!
"
9,11,Cartman,"I'm grubbin'. What's it look like?
"
6,4,Kyle,"Stan's getting worse, you guys.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Stay away from me, you stupid b-b-b-bitches!  No! God!  '
"
15,8,Kyle,"Really? Uh, Stan, that's great. 
"
6,1,Cartman,"Butters, I'm just trying to offer some motivational help here.
"
5,5,Stan,"They're not together anymore, dude.
"
3,10,Kyle,"...our hearts.  Kenny? 
"
2,15,Kyle,"Aunt Flo?
"
18,2,Cartman,"They've got what backward? 
"
16,8,Kyle,"We need you, Butters. You're the man! 
"
1,12,Kenny,"(Yeah, and I got this nice marble sack to go with this carrot stick, see?)
"
1,12,Stan,"D'you know John Elway?
"
17,9,Randy,"Stay at your post!  Nooo! NOOO! EVERYBODY REALLY LIKED HIM!! NOOO!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Well that's fine. I thought you guys were my friends, but I guess I was wrong! 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Go America.  Go Broncos. 
"
13,6,Randy,"Okay okay!  You're right. You're right, Finland! Okay? You're right. Can you just... let us other countries talk pr-private, for a moment?
"
9,7,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, kids, as your counselor, I know it can sometimes be difficult to talk about subjects like drugs and sex and alcohol, m'kay? So, as you remember, last week I told you to write down any difficult questions you had and put them in this box anonymously so we could discuss in class, m'kay? I got a lot o' responses, so let's read some aloud.  ""Mr. Mackey is gay.""  Okay kids, that is not funny! M'kay?! This box is supposed to be used for serious questions! About, about serious issues! M'kay, let's let's stop the tomfoolery!  M'kay, this looks like a real one here.  ""Dear Mr. Mackey, you are gay.""  All right, all right. That's enough, kids. Let's quiet down and try to be mature, 'kay?  Uh here we go. Okay, ""Mr. Mackey, sometimes my parents hit me, and you are gay.""  dammit, is there not one serious question in here?!  ""Mr. Mackey is gay, Mr. Mackey is gay""  Okay, here.  I am a boy at South Park Elementary. Sometimes, when I'm sitting in class, my penis becomes hard for no reason. What should I do?  All right kids, all right kids, that's enough!  If you all can't be serious about the question box,  then we'll just do drug identification exercises, unkay?!
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"THAT DOES IT!
"
9,13,Cartman,"We have to hurry!
"
11,11,Butters,"But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off...
"
8,13,Kyle,"Why won't anybody listen to me?!
"
7,1,Kyle,"Cartman, don't you remember the last time you had this dream?
"
3,3,Stan,"Now, Cartman! 
"
2,18,Kyle,"Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!
"
17,2,Stan,"You guys don't need to be watching that stuff. 
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy's salary, so that's three more admissions a day...  Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that's about four admissions - that brings the grand total to...  God-damnit!  Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! 
"
4,6,Cartman,"Thanks, dude. 
"
1,11,Wendy,"Hi guys, what's up?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh-uh, boys, LSD is bad. Hmmm...  Man, who put all this cotton in my mouth?  Yeah, baby... The world is so small.  I'm free... I'm free...
"
4,2,Kyle,"It's not true! 
"
16,6,Stan,"Come on guys, the day is wasting away. What would be something really cool we could do?
"
13,5,Cartman,"All this time I've been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it's just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That's what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.
"
8,1,Stan,"We don't have a choice, Kyle. Just humor them. Hyaaaaah! 
"
9,6,Kyle,"Thanks. 
"
5,7,Kenny,"(Wait until you see what I can do to the dog!)
"
6,7,Kyle,"Yeah, it's Ms. Choksondik alright.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Okay.  N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
"
8,1,Kenny,"(Butters!)
"
16,13,Cartman,"Uh huh.
"
10,2,Mr. Mackey,"Well from now on, I'm only going to associate with other hybrid-car drivers. Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay?
"
12,8,Butters,"Ping ping. Herro. ...Prease.
"
9,13,Kyle,"He talked! I swear to Abraham he talked, and he loves rocket ships!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat.
"
4,1,Stan,"Dah, that's what they all say. Okay, ready? Go! 
"
12,10,Cartman,"You're being extremely negative, Craig. 
"
14,1,Butters,"Haah! Leave me alone! 
"
2,16,Kyle,"That was totally gross. She smelled like vitamins and pee.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Because, dude, it's all over Eavesdropper!
"
1,2,Stan,"Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat cheesy poofs, ass-master!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Oh, thanks! 
"
16,9,Cartman,"And so to go through all that, your honor, to go through all the shame and daily ridicule, and then not to be able to take a simple shit at Best Buy?  At Besty Buy I'm sorry.  To be told by some Best Buy manager that your mobility scooter can't fit in his bathroom?  Oh God, excuse me! It's just so belittling, you know? All I wanted to do was take a dump, your honor. After all I've been through, can't I just take a dump at Best Buy?
"
16,2,Kenny,"(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)
"
13,10,Cartman,"Alright you guys, let's bring it in.  I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?
"
6,6,Kyle,"Who wants to tell him?
"
2,18,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman!  Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends.
"
18,6,Kyle,"You have your crutches!
"
5,13,Butters,"Uh, yeah?
"
3,6,Cartman,"What did you call me?
"
13,14,Cartman,"There are too many minorities (too many)
At my water park (somebody do something).
Where did they all come from?
Why can’t they leave this land alone?
And it’s such a tragedy (feel a bit like dying).
We looked the other way too long.
We’ve got to change our priorities
And get all these minorities
Out of my water park
(Minorities) Mexicans and Asians,
(Black people), I think I even saw a Native American (gross).
God I’m asking please, get all of these minorities
Out of my water park (my water park).
"
16,2,Butters,"Sorry. My arms hurt.
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Cash.)
"
3,2,Kyle,"Aw man, at least the real Jesus didn't weigh 400 pounds!
"
5,4,Timmy,"Euuh, livin' a lie, Timmih. 
"
16,3,Kyle,"We thought you were meeting us at Cartman's. What are you doing here, Taylor Swifting?
"
6,7,Butters,"Yeah, but he's still better than you, Butters.
"
14,10,Butters,"Hey Stan, I have a note for you.
"
1,10,Kyle,"Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?
"
3,3,Stan,"Why do you have to see an eye doctor?
"
4,14,Kyle,"Uh, Timmy, if we back to the other kids with that turkey they're gonna be pissed!
"
1,2,Stan,"Superfatass?
"
13,3,Stan,"I want to return this Margaritaville! My dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from Wall Street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you!
"
8,9,Stan,"Dad, we know how to destroy the Wall-Mart.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
"
8,9,Randy,"Too late for me, son! I have to buy this stuff!
"
10,3,Cartman,"Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle!
"
8,2,Kyle,"Cartman, I really, really have a problem with what you're doing. I object to it morally, and I find it grossly offensive. 
"
3,2,Stan,"Yeah, dummy, you have to get a nurection.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Huh, how long 'til we get the pictures back?
"
9,14,Stan,"Uh, look, my dad was here yesterday and ...you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease?
"
15,4,Butters,"Butters Stotch, 2.2 inches. Is that good?
"
17,6,Stan,"Um, dude, we need to talk. This has to stop.
"
3,15,Kyle,"Hey, shut your mouth, fatass!
"
4,14,Cartman,"Alright, alright! Quiet down! Look, we still got four days until the Thanksgiving festival; that's plenty of time to revamp our play!
"
7,7,Stan,"Ah, I don't know if I did or not. I, I saw something, someone spoke to me and... told me the middle-class white way to cure SARS.  Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, Dayquil, and Sprite.
"
15,1,Stan,"Oh boy.
"
15,11,Cartman,"Coach! Feegan the vegan won't jump off the board! Hey Coach!
"
15,7,Randy,"Ugh, that's so unfair!
"
14,5,Cartman,"Keep... your hand... UP!
"
9,5,Randy,"I just... don't think I can, all right?
"
2,2,Cartman,"Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!
"
16,2,Stan,"No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Who let the dogs out?
"
3,3,Kyle,"Chef, this place isn't you!
"
16,13,Stan,"Yeah I know.
"
10,8,Stan,"Dad, get off our teamspeak line!
"
9,6,Butters,"Well... how do you know you're not supposed to go to... you know... Heck.
"
8,9,Kyle,"-slashed the bus tires in Arkansas! I said so! I told you the minute that I-  -and I told you that-
"
7,13,Cartman,"Which means, if it weren't for tobacco, many of our black friends wouldn't be here today.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Later.
"
10,1,Cartman,"Oh, son of a bitch!
"
9,8,Kyle,"Stan, people in Beaverton are still trapped on their roofs. Nobody's helping them because they think they can't go outside.
"
1,13,Cartman,"Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh...  Well, see you guys. I'm gonna go stay in my backyard for a while.
"
2,5,Kyle,"But we could get killed!
"
9,13,Kyle,"No! Please, we have to go!
"
13,1,Kyle,"It's that ring. Somehow, putting on that ring has turned Kenny into a boring turd.
"
18,7,Butters,"Oh gosh!
"
1,8,Cartman,"Yeah, and never with Kenny, because his family is too poor.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Really?
"
16,8,Cartman,"That's right, Butters.
"
13,14,Kyle,"You guys wanna see how long I can hold my breath under water?
"
11,14,Stan,"Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Uh, alright then.  Oh, would you look at that? I've got a corn on my ankle.  Now where did that one come from? That's the fourth one I've had- 
"
1,1,Stan,"Visitors took Kyle's baby brother.
"
12,6,Randy,"Three minutes would be plenty.
"
17,2,Kyle,"Corey Lanskin?
"
10,7,Stan,"You can't stay here.
"
15,11,Randy,"Shelly, I'm sorry your little friend was killed by Spider-Man tonight. Just know that... for Spider-Man to do what he did, he must have had a very good reason. Spider-Man works in mysterious ways, Shelly. And wherever he is, he loves you. 
"
6,6,Kyle,"So? You're a smartass!
"
9,3,Stan,"All right.
"
12,10,Cartman,"I will play this card to move Kyle back seven spaces...  ...screw you Kyle.  Aaand all right, your turn, Kenny. 
"
11,3,Kenny,"(Not guilty!)
"
4,2,Butters,"Heh-hey guys, uh, wu-what are you doin'?
"
9,2,Stan,"Are you serious? We never heard that.
"
4,14,Kyle,"A smart one, that can do tricks.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Yes. This is a difficult case. In order to win the debate, we will need to attack Stan and Kyle's credibility.
"
11,6,Cartman,"Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read  ""The Old Man and the Sea"" for us. Comprende? ""The Old Mand Y La Mer"".
"
16,12,Randy,"Oho you'll see! I'm sorry, Stan, but in about thirty minutes this place is gonna be swamped with people trying to rent DVDs!
"
4,11,Timmy,"Haagggh.
"
13,9,Butters,"'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Well, Stan, thanks a lot for having such a cool uncle that got us all detention for a week.
"
18,5,Butters,"I don't know what to do!
"
1,10,Stan,"Oh great, Green Mega Man it is. 
"
11,13,Stan,"What, you mean it?
"
17,7,Kyle,"No! We can't divide like this!  Stan?  You're on our side, right?
"
8,10,Stan,"We're dead. Trent knows we sent the sixth-graders after him.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Now how the hell did he do that? 
"
16,6,Cartman,"""The next zipline? What are you talking about?""
"
9,13,Cartman,"Kyle, the show is over! The whale isn't gonna splash us any more, so who cares?
"
4,16,Kyle,"I did it! Now I can go to the Raging Pussies!
"
4,12,Stan,"Dude. Sh-she's right.
"
3,14,Kyle,"They're just drunk, Cartman! As soon as they sober up, they'll stop.
"
9,8,Stan,"Pretty funny?! Dude, we did that!! That was our fault!
"
13,10,Cartman,"Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.
"
11,2,Butters,"Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?
"
2,4,Stan,"Oh.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Turn around so I can clean out your ass.
"
2,9,Kyle,"All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
"
9,2,Cartman,"...All right, fine Chef, go!
"
10,7,Mr. Mackey,"You know that's not the point!
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy.
"
4,11,Kenny,"(Where am I?)
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"You all receive an F... minus.
"
2,13,Kyle,"I will if you give me money!
"
16,6,Kyle,"DUDE! Did you just shit your pants?!
"
18,1,Butters,"Oh boy, this is like Christmas morning!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Cool.  Ah, Kyle is at the door. Come in, Kyle!  Who are you?
"
10,14,Stan,"Play the Red Wings?
"
7,12,Stan,"Wull, maybe he won't fight.
"
11,3,Kenny,"Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop!
"
16,2,Stan,"Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?
"
15,9,Jimmy,"Eh, b-base.
"
7,3,Cartman,"I know what you mean, Kyle. I realize now that even though you might not get caught doing something bad, you can still get caught later.
"
9,2,Randy,"Stan! 
"
1,1,Cartman,"Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed...  in the dark, when all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room.  Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open,  and the next thing I remember, I was being drug through a hallway.  Then I was lying on a table,  and these scary hands wanted to operate on me. And they had big heads and big black eyes...
"
5,10,Stan,"Yeah, I guess we all are. Maybe things are finally gonna start getting a more sophisticated around here.
"
2,6,Kenny,"(Just face it, dude, your uncle's stupid!)
"
13,14,Cartman,"Noooo...  Eventually the minorities will do away with me altogether.
"
10,1,Kyle,"This doesn't make any sense!
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Ding-ding, ding-ding.
"
16,3,Stan,"I think they're onto us guys. Let's do this.  I got it.
"
18,2,Randy,"Well that's just a beer.
"
15,2,Cartman,"Dürfen wir der Kind dort..  ...geboten?  Voilà, er ist Jud. Eh? Ein schöner safter Jud. Er ist friiisch. Und wunderhübsch, wunderhüüübsch. 
"
15,6,Butters,"No! You told me NOT to play Inspector Butters!
"
13,14,Butters,"The who?
"
17,6,Cartman,"You're right. You're right, Kyle. I should just tell the truth and be done with it! 
"
11,5,Stan,"Just bread...
"
4,4,Stan,"Yeah. Phil Collins was right. People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he's protected from laughter.
"
2,10,Stan,"We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
"
5,12,Stan,"Your family is rich, dude.
"
18,6,Cartman,"Cool.
"
1,13,Cartman,"I don't have $3000.
"
16,6,Stan,"Four days ago, I came across a brochure for ziplining.  I thought it would be fun. I only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together. 
"
10,2,Stan,"Ow!
"
5,10,Cartman,"It was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded.  I don't think anything will ever be funny again. Oh God. What have I got?
"
18,1,Kyle,"That's the NFL!
"
17,6,Stan,"Well, I'm not okay with it, 'cause it's turned you into a dick, Kyle!
"
5,8,Kyle,"What? 
"
13,11,Stan,"...No, I don't care about the show.
"
3,13,Kyle,"When a man and a woman feel ...love... they put their lips together.
"
17,3,Cartman,"We've got about ten minutes before this entire country is up in flames! If you wanna live, you'd better step on the gas! Oh wait, is this a Tesla? Shit! Well press on the prissy pedal! We're gonna die!! 
"
9,13,Cartman,"Come on, guys, let's leave Kyle with his stupid whale.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow, what a terrific audience. So apparently it's been exactly two years since the fall of Baghdad. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Just as B-Bush predicted, Baghdad fell, Iraq fell, Saddam fell. The only thing that didn't fall was ...the price of gas.  I just read in the paper that China's protesting Japan. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this? Yeah, I guess in China you don't get to-  You've gotta be kidding me.
"
1,1,Cartman,"Alright. Why don't I have pinkeye then?
"
11,5,Kyle,"Eric Cartman can never know about this.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Goddamnit! Goddamnit!
"
6,7,Stan,"What do we do now?
"
12,11,Stan,"Dude, Craig, what's goin' on?
"
11,14,Kyle,"Huh??
"
4,1,Cartman,"Oh, I sure do, Mr. Mackey. I mean, I feel really bad, uhh. What was I thinking?  The only thing I can do now... is try to go on and live day by day.  See ya later.
"
13,14,Stan,"Not everybody pees in pools.
"
4,8,Kyle,"Yeah. 
"
10,6,Stan,"Oh, hey Dad.
"
10,1,Kyle,"HA! I knew it!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Weh- who do you think I'm talkin' about, Butters? Joyce de Witt?
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, I j-I just uh I'll be right back. Oh!  Aaaah! Oh it's bad!  Excuse me kids, I need to run, I gotta WUUGH!  OW!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
"
6,7,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
18,8,Cartman,"What's this?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!
"
3,4,Stan,"You're on!
"
4,13,Kyle,"Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"At long last I have foundA true reason to beNow I feel I can start anew--  Woo, whoa! Ow! Hey!  Uh oh hel-m. Hey!
"
4,9,Cartman,"We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
"
4,6,Stan,"We don't know.
"
16,6,Kyle,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! YOU BASTARDS!
"
10,2,Cartman,"Who? 
"
15,11,Randy,"A musical?  Nelson couldn't watch football 'cause his wife made him take her to a musical! 
"
7,13,Mr. Garrison,"Here he comes! 
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah. Screw this crap!) 
"
4,7,Stan,"Come on, where are they? 
"
6,7,Stan,"They found the sea men! It's only a matter of tiime before they find the women, too!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay.
"
1,2,Stan,"That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rainforest from a pop tart.
"
8,3,Kenny,"(Yeah, it totally sucked!)
"
5,11,Kyle,"Oh, bu- but isn't the cold air making the ball really hard? Ih-it's gonna hurt my hands.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Clyde!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Oh wow, a Jew asking for money! There's a new one.  Yuh, you guys know why Jews have glassy eyes?
"
17,6,Kyle,"I don't speak Hebrew.
"
2,13,Cartman,"I think we're almost to the end.
"
15,8,Stan,"No, dad, no. No, please!
"
15,7,Randy,"Yoyoyo! 
"
8,14,Stan,"I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!
"
13,4,Randy,"That's completely different!
"
10,9,Kyle,"Not yet.
"
1,1,Kenny,"(Nope, I'm all fine. Agh!) 
"
14,9,Stan,"Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is.
"
3,8,Butters,"Hey, uhour parents aren't religious fantastics. Why, we gotta tell them that they're makin' an awful mistake, don't we?
"
16,11,Butters,"Will somebody tell me what the frickity fookshmere is goin' on?!
"
18,2,Randy,"Make your dick fly off?
"
1,13,Kyle,"They laughed hardest at our video. We're gonna win!  We're gonna win!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! 
"
7,7,Randy,"You... understand if I'm a little wary of trusting you.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Get away from me, Cartman! 
"
8,14,Stan,"Grrr! Grrr! Come on out!  Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr!  Rawrrrrr! 
"
12,2,Kyle,"She's been built up to be sacrificed, Stan!
"
1,10,Stan,"Hey, Chef.
"
10,1,Stan,"Chef, we're leaving.
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"You will read it at home,  and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language!
"
2,10,Kenny,"(No, Mom, I'm seriously sick!)
"
5,6,Butters,"Well we wanna see the spook house. Uh well, we paid twenty-nine ninety five; we should be able to go in the spook house. 
"
5,12,Cartman,"Nothing! 
"
5,10,Jimmy,"What's this all about?
"
9,14,Randy,"Good morning, family. The Lord has truly blessed us with another beautiful day.  It's just amazing. I haven't had a drink in five days. Praise Christ. Praise him. 
"
15,8,Kyle,"See? There you go again. Look at you dude. Look what you've become.
"
6,12,Kyle,"It was such a long time ago!
"
18,9,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, will you make him stop!
"
17,2,Randy,"What the?  What the hell?  Yeah, hi, uhh, we aren't getting our informative murder porn. No, no, none of our channels that have informative murder porn appear to be working. Yeah, the screen just says ""How do you tame a horse in Minecraft?"" Uhhh yes, we do have children. A what? A parental lock?
"
10,10,Cartman,"I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.
"
15,5,Butters,"Well what the heck do we do now?
"
4,13,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Noo nono, I'm not getting in a pool with Kenny. He has herpes.
"
13,14,Cartman,"No! Dude, we gotta go to the wave pool first. It's so dope, as long as there aren't any minorities.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Noo! No.  Noo! 
"
18,6,Stan,"Okay.
"
6,13,Butters,"Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters.  We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. 
"
7,4,Kyle,"What should we do?
"
18,2,Cartman,"There's nothing left, you guys! The world is upside down. Things aren't gonna get better, they're gonna get worse.
"
4,12,Stan,"Wait a minute! I've got it. 
"
9,11,Cartman,"No, we're fine! Thank you!
"
1,10,Kyle,"Dude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Nuh uh.
"
9,1,Kyle,"Can I have three thousand dollars, Mom and Dad, huh?? Can I??
"
16,6,Cartman,"Nnnn-mo...
"
8,3,Kyle,"You were right. You were right all along. I thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on Jews, but... I didn't know, I... I didn't know.
"
16,4,Kenny,"(Me, too.)
"
9,8,Cartman,"Waaait! Waitwaitwaaait!
"
10,1,Cartman,"Maybe- maybe he's still okay.  No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-
"
6,12,Cartman,"God-damnit! This isn't even GOOD chocolate milk mix!
"
8,8,Stan,"I do love animals, just ...not like you guys do.
"
12,11,Cartman,"Nobody likes hanging out with people who complain all the time.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
8,4,Randy,"No, that's crap, Sharon. Stanley, when somebody challenges you to dance, you have to dance back at them, or else they'll think you're weak.
"
8,4,Randy,"Aw, mph! Uuuugh-ah.
"
3,2,Randy,"Stan?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Hey, what about us? Our show? 
"
3,13,Mr. Garrison,"Alright, children, let's just try to pretend there isn't a little boy in a huge plastic hamster ball here, and go on with our studies. Now, who can tell me when Columbus sailed the seas and discovered America?  Ehyes, Mark?
"
7,13,Kyle,"Who's Rob Reiner?
"
4,2,Stan,"We're in!
"
4,12,Timmy,"Timmi-hih-ih! 
"
4,2,Cartman,"How could-? How could you lie to me, Mother? Lie right to my face?
"
13,7,Butters,"So we wanted to come here and be pirates.
"
10,4,Kyle,"WHAT?!
"
9,8,Stan,"But they're trapped now and nobody's helping them!
"
11,12,Kyle,"No, I don't! The decision was overturned. 
"
5,6,Stan,"Alright, let's go.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Maybe we are.
"
13,6,Randy,"No, I mean... Odds are, they nuked themselves. You know, suicide.
"
18,2,Cartman,"Well I'm down. Between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever, and these assholes won't even remember us being dicks to them.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Uh. My adopted brother got taken back here to Canada? So, we want to talk to the new Canadian Prime Minister about getting him back?
"
9,3,Stan,"Uh excuse me, Token already has representation.
"
6,5,Kyle,"Will your sister let us watch it?
"
6,13,Randy,"Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the--  Oh, my God!  This is Lord of the Rings!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich.
"
11,7,Cartman,"All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Umm. Dare?
"
4,14,Timmy,"GOBBLES! 
"
2,13,Kyle,"Hang on, Cartman! 
"
8,7,Stan,"Son of a bitch!
"
8,3,Cartman,"All right, hang on. We're about to land.  Okay, First Officer Stan and Engineer Kenny, you come with me on the away team. Vulcan Jew Kyle will wait here.
"
7,11,Cartman,"No! Noooo!  Casa Bonita! Noooo!  AAAAH!!  Oh... God-damnit, I have to get invited to go! I'm just gonna have to start being nice to Kyle!
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah. I guess parents don't give a crap about violence if there's sex things to worry about.
"
9,14,Stan,"Oh Jesus. 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Dude! I almost thought those Afghani kids talked you into not liking America.
"
15,9,Cartman,"¡Respeto mi autóridad! 
"
9,14,Randy,"Oh bless you, sir! Bless you!  'Scuse me, out of the way, alcoholic coming through!  She's... beautiful.  Aaaah. AAAAAaaaaah!  I'm... not... going... to drink this. I'm not going to drink this!  It's a miracle! I'm cured!  Yoohoohoo! Praise Jesus! Praise Mary the Blessed Virgin Mother! Thank you! Thank you God! 
"
15,5,Kyle,"Here's the thing: Whether or not I'm a part of it, crack baby basketball is popular. Somebody's going to do it. So the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it, so that I can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies.  Oh, it's sooo easy for you, isn't it? I mean, what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today, or what you want to watch on TV tomorrow? Well sorry, Skippy, but the world isn't always black and white! Just because some people are born poorer than others doesn't mean I can't enjoy a few McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of gravy from Kentucky Fried Chicken!
"
6,9,Stan,"Yeah well, sometimes the things we do don't matter right now. Sometimes they matter... later. We have to care more about later sometimes, you know? I think that's what separates us from the Steven Spielbergs and George Lucases of the world.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Oh, Wendy came and told on me?! So what? Because she's president she can't be written about?
"
13,7,Butters,"Ahoy fellow club members. Congratulations on leaving your meaningless lives behind to become pirates.  Your life of boredom is at an end, thanks to Captain Cartman. All hands on deck! 
"
10,8,Butters,"O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then.
"
6,11,Kyle,"Why did you go and have to be abducted, Tweek? Now all our parents are freaking out!
"
18,1,Cartman,"Digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the Washington Redskins are all about!  Now come on, guys! If you wanna be a successful business, then you have to be honest about what you are!  Once you take a stand on something, you're pretending like your company is about more than money. Then all of a sudden you're the NFL and and your players get caught molesting little boys!
"
13,12,Cartman,"Ni-nice, okay.
"
1,7,Stan,"Wendy's going as Raggedy Ann, and she said this way we'd win the costume contest for sure.
"
2,14,Stan,"Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets.
"
4,9,Stan,"Dad? What the hell is going on?
"
6,7,Butters,"I'll bury a skeleton wearing angel wings so that the townspeople will think a fallen angel has fallen-
"
9,8,Randy,"Stan?? Stan!!
"
5,13,Cartman,"Alright! Now Kenny has a fighting chance.
"
14,10,Wendy,"Stan? We need to talk about your locker.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"You you aren't gonna... tell anybody, are you?
"
10,6,Kyle,"Stan! Stan, wake up!
"
8,9,Randy,"The screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight!
"
5,12,Stan,"Oh hey, there's Token. 
"
14,14,Randy,"You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Blulululuh. Screw you guys.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Why Kyle?! So you can try and ruin things for Token and Nichole?! Look at how happy they are!  Is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic?!
"
10,7,Cartman,"You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other.
"
5,7,Kenny,"(Waa-ooo!) 
"
15,7,Randy,"Well, do you really thnk we should be telling our son what music he can and can't listen to?
"
6,15,Stan,"You are so a douche! I'm nominating you for the Biggest Douche in the Universe award, you douche!  Son of a bitch. 
"
8,13,Cartman,"Good, because you assholes have kept me up for three hours!
"
14,2,Cartman,"We know, we were just saying that.
"
15,10,Kyle,"Where is it coming from?
"
13,2,Kyle,"Why do you care?
"
2,12,Stan,"'Kay.
"
13,7,Cartman,"There will be refreshments served! So make sure your mom goes to the grocery store, Kevinnn! So come one, come all! The invitation is open to any student who wants to be a pirate, and who isn't Jewish, Mexican or ginger! Arrrgh!
"
3,5,Stan,"Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?
"
1,1,Cartman,"Ow!
"
7,1,Stan,"Oh shit, did we do that?
"
6,13,Stan,"But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Whassup?  Whassup?
"
15,5,Kyle,"And it actually helps the crack babies. It's like volunteering but, but we just make a little on the side.
"
3,14,Kyle,"I know, but—why do they have to take it out on us? Why do we have to wait around for them to come back?
"
6,6,Kyle,"Token.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yeah, huh! You wanna go with us so that later you go, ""Haha, I was working for Wall-Mart all along"" or something.
"
10,6,Kyle,"Aw, dude! 
"
2,2,Cartman,"Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
"
1,1,Stan,"Uh, I said that rabbits eat lettuce.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Alright, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transginger.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy.  You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. 
"
7,1,Kyle,"We went through all that just for some gay video of Earth?
"
5,4,Cartman,"You're welcome, Scott. 
"
6,9,Stan,"So we have to warm his icy heart with a ""hot"" island song
"
4,14,Timmy,"Tim-mih.
"
14,5,Randy,"Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments.
"
2,13,Kyle,"..Oh.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Ogh, alright, alright! I'll let two more people in each day so I can hire a maintenance person.
"
10,1,Stan,"Yeah, it's way, way more retarded.
"
15,5,Stan,"McDonald's French fries in a hot tub of... KFC gravy?
"
10,3,Cartman,"If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!
"
7,10,Kyle,"Country Kitchen Buffet?
"
3,16,Stan,"I'm not bleeding out my aahass!
"
8,12,Butters,"H-help! You've gotta hide me!  Don't tell her I'm in here! 
"
2,9,Stan,"Whatcha doin'?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well, you know...
"
6,7,Butters,"Wokay , then I'm goin' to start a Web site to spread vicious ru-rumrs about everyone in town! And and then I'll take their-
"
4,17,Stan,"This is hopeless. We're just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of Christmas.
"
6,8,Kyle,"You won the bet. You were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth, and I've just been frustrated because I didn't think of it first. I want you to enjoy that money because... you really impressed me with your insight and... I'm... proud to have you as a friend.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah, we're here for the cock Magic.
"
1,3,Stan,"Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.
"
1,4,Stan,"That's it, Sparky! Kick his ass! 
"
10,9,Stan,"Well why did you have to involve me??
"
18,10,Randy,"A holiday special. Oh my God.
"
7,7,Stan,"This land is not for sale.
"
18,10,Cartman,"I can hear you, douchebag.
"
8,11,Stan,"Then, let's do Token's report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade.
"
6,8,Kyle,"It wouldn't work!
"
2,16,Cartman,"My stupid friends want to go to the mall to visit Mr. Hankey, but nobody would drive us.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Yes, that's it.  I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!
"
4,6,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, I'm gonna give you... AIDS! 
"
15,7,Stan,"You guys... don't wanna be around me?
"
18,7,Stan,"Oh fuck you!
"
4,17,Kyle,"See ya! 
"
12,8,Kyle,"No... No!  No...
"
9,14,Stan,"I've had a great teacher.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Hey dude.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Wha- Okay, look, I'll talk to the Pharaoh and see if he'll change his mind.
"
2,4,Kyle,"I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!  Come on, Ike!  Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
"
5,7,Stan,"I had no idea dogs made milk; do it again.
"
6,10,Stan,"Yeah.
"
7,1,Stan,"Television? 
"
4,9,Cartman,"God damnit! People are walking away! 
"
6,7,Stan,"The sea people that we put in the teacher's coffee.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Dude, if my mom knew I was in here, I would be in super big trouble.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Well, lessee, in the last three point two seconds you've called me ""fatass,"" ""butthole,"" and ""douchebag."" I really don't feel like you guys's friend. 
"
10,2,Stan,"Yeah.
"
10,4,Cartman,"Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air.
"
12,3,Cartman,"Who is it?!
"
7,8,Cartman,"Oh, you know, you're right, Stan. We just have to tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore.
"
7,1,Cartman,"When do we get to eat. I'm hungry.
"
1,7,Stan,"Yeah, what's the matter? Couldn't your family afford a costume for you?
"
8,1,Cartman,"We're twice the ninjas you fags are!
"
3,2,Mr. Mackey,"So, you boys understand you have to do that regularly, oh-mkay? 
"
15,5,Stan,"...You sound like Cartmam.
"
3,16,Mr. Garrison,"This sucks balls!
"
6,8,Kyle,"Hm. 
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Woohoo!) 
"
15,10,Cartman,"I put a lot of Arby's horsey sauce on those.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Wait. Wait. I think I can explain this whole thing. Marklar, these marklars want to change your marklar. They don't want Marklar or any of these marklars to live here because it's bad for their marklar. They use Marklar to try and force marklars to believe they're marklar. If you let them stay here, they will build marklars and marklars. They will take all your marklars and replace them with Marklar. These marklar have no good marklar to live on Marklar, so they must come here to Marklar. Please, let these marklars stay where they can grow and prosper without any marklars, marklars, eh or marklars.
"
2,18,Kyle,"We have to get our friend, Steve-
"
13,3,Kyle,"Come on, this is ridiculous!
"
14,2,Kyle,"Dude, some people really do consider this obscene.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Oh my God, look at this!  Motherfucker!
"
7,12,Stan,"Yeah, but... how?
"
9,7,Stan,"He's what?? 
"
6,16,Stan,"Uh hello, we're here about the revenge on our parents?
"
12,8,Butters,"Yeah,  fuck 'em.
"
15,5,Stan,"You guys are ten years old and you just figured out that Slash isn't real? Oh my God. 
"
7,15,Cartman,"Well come on, let's hurry! It's almost Christmas! 
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Ow.)
"
12,7,Butters,"Yeah, well, I guess that's kinda true.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"You're not leaving me! You try to leave me and I'll kill you, bitch!
"
13,7,Cartman,"You guys, the fuck? Are you forgetting how crappy your lives are?! All the homework, the rules?! Butters, do you really wanna just go back to school, where people just make fun of you?
"
3,14,Kyle,"And if the North wins you're our slave for a month??
"
10,2,Stan,"No...
"
18,2,Kyle,"Cartman? Come on, dude. You have to get up.
"
13,14,Butters,"Hey look! 
"
1,4,Stan,"He's just confused.
"
16,14,Butters,"Bleh, ogayedmi.
"
4,7,Stan,"...Dude, you weren't drinking any milk.
"
12,3,Cartman,"Well, Kenny? Are you buzzed? 
"
1,7,Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, let's get you lined up so the judge can get a good look at your stupid little costumes.  Children, this year we have a celebrity judge, the star of 'Family Ties', Miss Tina Yothers. 
"
6,6,Cartman,"You don't drink tea in a ballpark, you French piece of crap!
"
8,9,Kyle,"The heart of Wall-Mart?
"
2,7,Mr. Garrison,"She's not really Kathie Lee Gifford. She's some kinda alien. 
"
9,4,Kyle,"Come on, everybody. I think Kenny wants to be left alone. 
"
9,11,Kyle,"And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child's red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul,  but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. 
"
3,5,Kyle,"What are you doing, fatass?!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well, uh d-don't you all look nice.
"
13,14,Cartman,"You guys! You guys, we have got problems of Biblical proportions!
"
16,5,Stan,"Alright Kyle, that's enough! I'm not gonna be bullied by you, okay?!
"
6,6,Cartman,"Four friends, just one rose. The moment of truth is here. Kyle? Who does the rose go to? 
"
5,13,Kyle,"I actually hugged you. I held you in my arms and, and, cried with you.
"
7,7,Randy,"Hey, mister!! We're not like them, all right?!  Now, we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while, but we aren't the ones kicking people out of their homes! So don't you compare us to those cold-hearted, money-grubbing, evil stinky Indians!  I'm sorry, Native Americans.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Oh, and doctor. ...Ah, never mind. 
"
12,1,Butters,"I know, but are you sure Kyle has to be taught a lesson?
"
8,1,Cartman,"Go ahead and scramble it, then he won't remember it was us.
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"Oh no.
"
6,16,Kyle,"Some high schoolers left their marijuana cigarette behind. Uh we have to throw it away before some kids find it or something.
"
5,4,Stan,"Who are you?
"
16,10,Kyle,"I know...
"
13,14,Cartman,"It has been many, many hours since the Apocalypse, and all I keep thinking is ""Why me? Why am I the only one of my race God chose to survive in this minority-run world?"" When the smoke has cleared I'm sure the minorities will start rebuilding, building the world... in their way. I can see it now. Nooo... 
"
14,8,Butters,"Eric! Don't ever talk like that!
"
13,10,Cartman,"I did. I'm the Rad Russian.  I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!
"
4,6,Cartman,"I've gotta start hanging out with friends that are a little more intelligent, and understand ...politics and stuff. It's just that... I'm up on this level up here , and all my friends are down here .
"
17,5,Kyle,"Because you're my little brother, Godddamnit!  And even when I'm fifty and you're forty-five, you're still gonna be my little brother!
"
17,6,Cartman,"I totally lied, Kyle. And when you asked me if I had lied, I looked you right in the eye and said ""No."" I owe you an apology and, I mean it.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Oh no. Butters!
"
15,10,Butters,"Hang on, Lemmiwinks!
"
10,8,Cartman,"Now, leave me alone, don't do-  that, dugh  God-fucking-damnit!!! 
"
4,13,Cartman,"But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
"
8,14,Stan,"No Santa, don't!
"
16,4,Cartman,"I didn't think you would believe me. And that why last night I took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video.  What I'm about to show you is the first video ever shot of a Jewpacabra.  And you're the first to see it.  This is just after 8 p.m. First we heard rustling in the bushes. Then a strange, animal-like scurrying sound. That's when we saw, this.  'Kay wait for it, wait for it, wait for it... wait for it... wait for...  right there! Did you see the Jewpacabra? I know, it's so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what it's seeing. Watch again.  Wait for it... wait... there!  Jewpacabra. There's a Jewpacabra in South Park. God help us.
"
12,2,Stan,"You do?
"
11,11,Kyle,"Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!
"
6,7,Butters,"Bring the World Cup to South Park so the... a huge soccer riot can destroy the-
"
11,5,Kyle,"So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?
"
1,12,Cartman,"Huh I don't care. You can have this stupid arrowhead, I don't want it. 
Day is never finished, Massa got me working... Oh, look, I found another one  Ooh, this is just a stupid triangle! 
"
16,2,Stan,"This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!
"
7,14,Kyle,"What are you doing?
"
14,5,Kyle,"K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?
"
2,13,Cartman,"I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.
"
10,9,Stan,"A wall toilet for peeing in.
"
2,13,Stan,"Damn it!  That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that.
"
10,2,Kyle,"Helping my Dad give people fake tickets. 
"
15,12,Cartman,"What? What?! WHAT?! What are you guys talking about? What are you guys doin'—What are you talking about? I knew it! You guys are having a big 99% rally, aren't you?! Occupying the cafeteria?! You wanna know why you guys are all here protesting?! Because you're pissed off, but you actually think it's wrong to be pissed off at a black president, so you're all just pissed off at ME! Well go ahead! Have your little rally to figure out how to stick it to the 1%! See what it gets you! 
"
8,1,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
7,14,Butters,"She wants to see me again! My Raisins girl said she wants to see me again!
"
15,10,Stan,"Wendy, it was just a quick e-mail to Kenny. New stories pop up on Eavesdropper every hour. People are gonna forget all about this.
"
7,13,Cartman,"You guys, I am seriously gettin' pissed off heh! Now come on, we're goin' to the tobacco company.
"
6,16,Stan,"Aw, come on, Mom.
"
7,10,Cartman,"More old people!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Don't be so quick to throw off your ninja responsibility, Kyle.  Now, come on guys, sure, it's easy to be a ninja when everything's going your way, but it's times like these, when the chips are down, that a ninja shows his true character.
"
5,13,Kyle,"AAARGH! 
"
2,8,Kyle,"Wow! These are huge!
"
4,16,Cartman,"Hey, yeah! We should all say our parents molestered us!
"
3,15,Kyle,"with dreidel I shall play.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Well just, give it a couple of minutes, Jenny. It could just be a cramp.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"But don't you see the price? You're selling out your own kind. Look, us gays have created a lifestyle, a, a culture that is uniquely ours. If we keep trying to make straight people into us, well, we're gonna have no identity left.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Kenny! You're gonna let a girl put her mouth on your wiener? Do you know how disgusting that is? Girls' mouths are full of germs!
"
5,3,Stan,"What's going on? 
"
4,2,Kenny,"(Fuck you!)
"
13,11,Stan,"As soon as we get there, we've gotta deploy the tracking device! We can't let those whales get hurt! 
"
6,5,Stan,"I wonder if it's all a western?
"
9,3,Stan,"Yeah, you wouldn't kill her, 'cause then she can't pay you money! We know because we're in the same business you are!
"
12,8,Butters,"I don't want my parents to die.
"
10,9,Cartman,"Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
"
17,7,Randy,"No! You can't die! Everybody really likes you!
"
3,3,Stan,"Yeah?
"
3,16,Cartman,"Look, Kenny and I are mature now. We can't spend New Year's Eve with a couple of kids. Did you get your Maxi pads, Kenny?
"
6,17,Cartman,"Oh I hate this stupid Christmas poo.  Hello, Mr. Hankey! A Merry Christmas to you!
"
12,14,Butters,"I no longer need to explain anything to you, Father!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Yeah?
"
6,8,Stan,"Does this mean we have to go to church on Sundays again?
"
15,10,Cartman,"Heh! You're crazy! It can't be done!
"
8,7,Randy,"Stan Marsh!
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Alright, fine. Bring her in, Adler. 
"
5,6,Butters,"We're waitin' in line for the-ah spook house.
"
4,9,Stan,"Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
"
6,9,Kyle,"Nonono! We need to do this first.
"
16,7,Kyle,"The new girl liked me, and so you lied to her!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Aw crap! You mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone else's because of me?!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Dude! Did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches?
"
1,4,Stan,"Good dog, Sparky. Who's my best buddy? Who's the boy? Who's the buddy?
"
17,2,Stan,"Well then maybe you should go live with Jaden Smith, Dad.
"
1,1,Mr. Garrison,"Hmm, guess you'll have to take your seat, Kyle.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Well, I understand the people who did it weren't caughts, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. 
"
11,7,Stan,"What the hell happened here? 
"
4,17,Stan,"Don't you see, Kyle?
"
2,17,Kyle,"So what are we gonna say?
"
6,4,Cartman,"Egh! Some God-damned Klingon you are!
"
2,15,Stan,"I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
"
16,9,Kyle,"When the bar gets lowered, Token, we all pay the price. What if Honey Boo Boo was a little black girl? Being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy?
"
12,12,Randy,"We don't have to take... crap... from the fit- rich, fat cats anymore.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Do British people count as an ethnicity for hate crimes?
"
13,11,Stan,"Yeah, this is gonna be awesome.
"
2,14,Kyle,"Hey, that's your song for Wendy!
"
2,11,Cartman,"As if we care.
"
9,1,Kyle,"Oo whataya mean?
"
2,12,Stan,"Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
"
3,8,Stan,"I don't wanna hang out in the kids' room. I won't know anybody
"
6,15,Cartman,"Right now?
"
1,9,Kyle,"Well!  You're gonna be sorry when you see me riding around on Santa's sleigh with Mr. Hankey, fatass!
"
10,6,Kyle,"Yeah, we've got school anyway.
"
13,11,Cartman,"No, I just don't care. At all.
"
15,11,Randy,"It felt like a dream, bro. Broadway is simply the greatest time a dude can have. Just kind of sucks to be back here now, you know? I mean there's no culture here. Only Broadway show in Denver is ""Wicked"" and I've already taken Sharon to see it twenty three times.
"
8,11,Cartman,"Right. We should make up stories, because they'll be far more interesting.
"
11,13,Stan,"Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there!  Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!
"
10,11,Cartman,"Dude...
"
3,2,Stan,"Why is that funny?
"
12,5,Cartman,"Hello students. I'm Eric Cartmanez.  Your new teacher.
"
9,14,Kyle,"No, dude, it's the police. 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Token actually pays attention in school! Unlike you, fatass!
"
4,1,Stan,"Just wait. We got Cartman pardoned; he'll be here any second.
"
11,14,Butters,"I donno.
"
10,8,Kenny,"(Me too.)
"
2,14,Cartman,"Three Crispy Yum Yums.
"
1,8,Stan,"Hey, where's Cartman?
"
2,3,Stan,"I.
"
6,2,Randy,"All the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting, right, and- and it's been a day and a half! These guys won't let us leave!
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Other.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Check.
"
1,9,Kyle,"Officer Barbrady!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Al-righty then. Let's get to my presents, shall we?
"
1,11,Stan,"You guy can stop fighting. It was me she was checking out!
"
3,2,Cartman,"Chef! Chef!
"
17,2,Stan,"Look, can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want?
"
3,2,Stan,"Station One: Jesus is condemned to death by Pilate.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I will.  Good-bye, Mom! Good-bye, Dad!  Gray skies are gonna clear up; put on a happy face...
"
16,8,Randy,"YEAH!  YEAH! WOO!
"
13,8,Cartman,"I think... you and I might be able to help each other here today.
"
4,4,Stan,"No!  You see, we learned something today. Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what's wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn't mean we don't care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be ""protected"" and kept out of the public's eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you had to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing. That's why Timmy rules!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Alright,
"
4,1,Kenny,"(Hey!)
"
4,11,Stan,"Kenny?!  What's he say?
"
6,17,Cartman,"Yeah, so how's it look?
"
2,12,Randy,"Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.  You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?
"
13,6,Stan,"Whoawhoawhoa Dad, what are we doing?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Guys, I need to talk to you.
"
14,8,Cartman,"You see I told you guys!  What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! 
"
9,12,Stan,"I'm not the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard. And... Scientology is just a big fat global scam.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Alright, come in.  Kenny's here; I told him all about it. 
"
6,2,Randy,"Wait...
"
1,3,Kyle,"Aaaaah! 
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Alright, let's try it again.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Fly back to the house, stupid!
"
1,5,Kyle,"You mean this one?
"
11,9,Randy,"Oh. Lasagna's ready.  You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Yeah, I'll bet.
"
17,6,Cartman,"I'm pretty sure that this cow could make ginger cheese, which is like a Swiss cheese, except instead of holes, it has freckles. 
"
12,7,Wendy,"Where are you going, Stan?
"
6,14,Kyle,"Bad.
"
14,3,Stan,"A what?
"
7,5,Kyle,"Oh Jesus.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Don't be stupid, Cartman! Butters doesn't have that much blood in him!
"
5,13,Cartman,"Fine! I don't need you assholes! I can sell these fetuses all on my own!
"
15,7,Cartman,"That looks pretty good.
"
5,6,Stan,"Dude, are you okay?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Yeah, I just told her I was running late and that it won't happen again.
"
8,9,Stan,"No, dad! We need your keys!
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Uh huh.)
"
13,10,Cartman,"O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!
"
16,8,Randy,"Look, the point has been made, okay?! I'm warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Why not?
"
17,2,Stan,"What?
"
3,3,Stan,"Yeah! He's gonna be so thankful we told him. 
"
1,13,Mr. Mackey,"Well-obviously something is bothering him.  Oh, of course!  My video camera! Boys, if you could videotape Eric's behavior, then I can study him psychologically and find out what's wrong, mkay?
"
3,15,Cartman,"that's why they're lame.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Wow.
"
7,12,Stan,"No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?
"
16,14,Jimmy,"There's nothing here, Kyle. Not even one s-s-scooby clue.
"
4,9,Cartman,"I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. 
"
7,7,Mr. Garrison,"Well, this is it, Mr. Slave. We're officially homeless.
"
1,12,Stan,"You did throw it away, Cartman.
"
16,8,Stan,"Dad, do we really have to wear bras?
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, you can get a lot of action when you have a hot tub.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Fine! Then you won't mind giving us a semen sample. 
"
10,11,Butters,"Thanks. 
"
1,1,Stan,"Kyle, look! It's them.
"
13,14,Cartman,"Six adorable children please.
"
2,5,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, Principal Victoria, Nurse Gollum has conjoined twin myslexia.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Alright Cartman, I've been doin' a lot of thinking about how the company's gonna spend the money we make off the EA Sports deal. We're going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies.
"
7,4,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus...
"
2,9,Stan,"Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer.
"
1,11,Cartman,"Yes, ma'am.
"
1,5,Cartman,"Ehh, you leave Fluffy out of this!
"
6,5,Cartman,"What's wrong with the colors on your TV, Stan? They're all saturated. 
"
3,2,Cartman,"What the hell happened to him?
"
2,8,Cartman,"Wow.
"
1,4,Cartman,"Stan's dog's a homo. Stan's dog's a homo. 
"
6,17,Kenny,"(Oh, I've just been hanging out.)
"
5,4,Cartman,"Sweet!  Uh. Oh, goddamnit!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Sir, we have come to offer you the business deal of a lifetime.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Thta's pretty kewl.
"
4,2,Kyle,"No more money??
"
4,10,Cartman,"Oh yeah, okay.
"
2,17,Kenny,"(In my family, it's a silly enterprise.)
"
18,8,Stan,"That was freakin' hardcore.
"
7,11,Cartman,"All right, this way, Butters. Just follow the sound of my voice. 
"
15,9,Butters,"Sing your Song, earn your pay
"
13,10,Butters,"Yes! Yehhehehes!
"
18,8,Kyle,"Uhhh, we aren't cops or anything.
"
6,16,Butters,"Hooray!  And then we can make our wieners bigger, and have the lady massage them.
"
12,3,Stan,"What titties?
"
3,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, please God, let it be forever.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Let us pray.  Heavenly Father, do not send us to hell. We're sorry. Whatever we did, we're sorry.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Funny how voting works in this country, isn't it, Kyle.  Each one of these, a person. Someone who actually took the time to get themselves informed. Actually got up and drove to a voting area to make sure their voice was heard. 
"
13,3,Randy,"I am pretty smart, yea. But I have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan.
"
9,2,Cartman,"All right, fine. But now listen up and listen good! I've never tried to get rid of this many hippies before, so I'm gonna need every resource this town has! And even if I don't succeed, and it's a million-to-one shot that I will, I still get the Tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where Kyle has to watch me and get super-jealous because he doesn't have one! Are we clear?! 
"
6,1,Butters,"Wow.
"
5,8,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
18,9,Kyle,"See? Look at this. Ike has all his friends over and they're just sitting around on their own computers barely talking to each other. Ike is watching PewDiePie play Dragon Age.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Excuse me!
"
4,15,Stan,"I can't do it, dude.
"
9,3,Stan,"Oh, thanks.
"
18,6,Kyle,"You... missed school today?
"
18,6,Kyle,"Did you play the Terrance & Phillip freemium game all day?
"
6,16,Stan,"But I have to know for sure. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Kyle!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Got ya! 
"
14,10,Randy,"Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now.
"
4,4,Stan,"Get off the stage, Phil Collins! We want Timmy!
"
8,11,Jimmy,"I think maybe he's f-feeling it.
"
4,6,Kyle,"You don't know what you're talking about, fatass!
"
10,6,Cartman,"You'd better get us out of here, asshole!
"
6,8,Randy,"Yeah! 
"
13,5,Butters,"Hey look, Eric killed a dragon.
"
14,5,Cartman,"I'm sorry  Why are you doing this?
"
6,16,Stan,"I don't believe that he's my future self!
"
2,14,Kyle,"Yeah, b-but how?
"
1,4,Stan,"Hike!
"
11,3,Jimmy,"Yeah! We're gonna fu-fu-fuck him up! 
"
9,8,Cartman,"Hand over the gold!
"
9,3,Stan,"Uh, we're sorry dude, but getting her career off the ground would take too much work for us.
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, no Wendy, apparently, you called Butters' girlfriend a hobbit.
"
10,10,Kyle,"The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Just hangin' out. What are you up to?
"
11,5,Randy,"Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter.
"
17,1,Butters,"Yes.
"
8,2,Cartman,"You see, gentlemen? The Special Olympics Championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away.  I'm going to go sign up now.
"
8,6,Kyle,"All right, let's just say all the bad things said about Mr. Jefferson are lies! Let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit!  Let's say it's all made up, and Mr. Jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood. Well that's fine, except for that he HAS children now! And when people have children, they have to grow up!
"
11,8,Cartman,"You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say.
"
3,13,Kyle,"You got my note?
"
3,8,Randy,"Huh? Oh, you mean, this?
"
2,12,Stan,"Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs.
"
15,8,Butters,"Do the girls get their shots right in the vagina?
"
13,11,Stan,"Oh what? So now that I have a hit TV show you guys care about dolphins and whales?
"
2,7,Kenny,"(Hey you guys. Remember when Terrance and Phillip was off the air?)
"
17,3,Cartman,"Get to an airport!
"
13,1,Butters,"Um, does Kenny like her?
"
11,5,Randy,"No! That is not the way we're remembering it!
"
3,12,Stan,"Aw, dude, that was just the fifth graders.
"
9,5,Cartman,"All right! 
"
17,10,Jimmy,"Wow! Wow! She looks great!
"
14,6,Cartman,"I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!
"
9,6,Stan,"I want a breast!
"
1,7,Stan,"Where'd you get that?
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah, you suck, dude!
"
18,6,Jimmy,"The Terrance & Phillip mobile game.  All the cool kids are usin' it.
"
2,10,Randy,"I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
"
1,5,Stan,"Officer Barbrady, my evil genetic clone is destroying the town.  We have to find him.
"
9,6,Stan,"Who was that?
"
14,2,Cartman,"No on, come on, let's read it now!
"
16,9,Kyle,"Well, because you got good coordination, sharp reflexes, and you're fucking fat.
"
11,10,Butters,"Me?? Woo, what am I supposed to do?
"
10,10,Randy,"Yeah, she's a hot victim. 
"
13,1,Kyle,"Yeah, it's just so astounding.
"
5,6,Stan,"Goddamnit Cartman, let me in!
"
6,4,Butters,"Uh-wait. I thought... yoyou said we needed him because he has the ""Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset.""
"
10,4,Cartman,"Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frère!
"
6,14,Kyle,"Not him!
"
9,2,Randy,"It's working!
"
18,6,Randy,"All right. And if you two stop, then we won't have a problem anymore.  HM. Earthy, bold, hint of cherry aftertones. *uurp*
"
6,10,Wendy,"Stan, you've never asked me to throw rocks at cars with you guys.
"
8,11,Butters,"Lie about celebrities.
"
2,16,Kenny,"(Hey, you guys. I'm right here.)
"
11,2,Cartman,"Give it back, Kyle!
"
10,12,Cartman,"I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.
"
14,7,Jimmy,"All right! Everyone together! Are we gonna beat Red Team this year?
"
5,2,Butters,"Oh, well, here he is.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Okay. Token, come on in, please. 
"
14,4,Wendy,"You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page,  we aren't friends!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Yi- you're serious here. There really is no tooth fairy?
"
9,10,Kyle,"Well, you might have made it, but we're the ones who are taking care of it now. You have your own egg to look out for!
"
11,2,Stan,"Because it's really, really funny.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Well, the school put the sizes of all our penises up on a big chart in the school hallway!
"
12,13,Stan,"Just like me, all I ever wanted was to sing and dance.
And now that I stood up for my dream I finally have the chance.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Why not?!
"
1,9,Stan,"We'll catch up with you later, Kyle. 
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Then you're an Indian.
"
1,3,Kenny,"(Hey guys, come here.)
"
17,3,Cartman,"Uh oh.  Sounds like you're still angry, Token.
"
9,11,Kyle,"Stupid supremacist asswipe!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?
"
4,13,Stan,"Not it! You lose, Kenny. 
"
3,13,Butters,"Yeah, tha-that was real badass how you stood up for your sister. Uh-uh-I'd have kicked Kyle's bitch ass, too.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Casa Bonita! Come on, you guys!  Oh, awesome!!  Come on, you guys! Black Bart's Cave!  Wow, cliff divers!  More sopapillas, please! 
"
2,15,Stan,"Yeah, dude.
"
4,1,Butters,"Well, all that time we didn't understand what a... unique and magical ass it was.
"
1,7,Stan,"I know, but uh-... but...
"
14,8,Butters,"Really?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Uh Butters, uhh, get back to the access point now.
"
18,9,Kenny,"(Commentary?)
"
10,8,Cartman,"This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth!  From with-
"
15,13,Cartman,"Oh... We're not too late. Mother, come!  Hey! Where is it!
"
7,9,Butters,"Heeheeheeyeah.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Gentlemen, imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds, and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oh, yes, hello. I am helping out a family who has a missing child, and I was wondering if you could print his photo on your milk carton? 
"
14,5,Cartman,"If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are...  Mitch Conner.
"
5,14,Butters,"It's a-  Awww, shucks,  I can't tell you. Uh, but it's really nifty.
"
12,12,Kyle,"Hey, excuse me, but we need some help.
"
13,1,Butters,"Well, apparently Kenny has a girlfriend!
"
3,10,Kyle,"Liberace gay.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Aw crap!
"
2,4,Cartman,"That's the proper way to say it, or else you get a spanking.
"
14,14,Randy,"Yeah?
"
5,11,Cartman,"Could be tough. But I'll give it a shot.
"
10,9,Butters,"From Eric.
"
18,7,Butters,"I wonder how long I'm grounded for?
"
3,12,Stan,"What's the scariest thing we could get?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Kyle, Goddamnit, will you just do-?
"
3,5,Stan,"Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
"
11,13,Cartman,"'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!
"
13,13,Butters,"Yeah, and she hates Smurfs!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Locked and loaded. Full metal bush, bro.
"
15,10,Cartman,"WAY worse!
"
5,3,Kyle,"David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night.  We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
"
6,12,Cartman,"What the hell is this?! Chocolate milk mix?!
"
16,6,Kyle,"How, how long do we have to take the shuttle?
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Oh, I was so close! You should have seen those titties.)
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"You are the Jewish community!
"
2,13,Kyle,"Okay. Here we go.  Hey! That was right on target.
"
8,11,Kyle,"I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Okay, okay, you can have your powers back.
"
9,13,Stan,"I wonder... if he'll ever come back and visit us.
"
17,9,Cartman,"He's just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because I'm in his garden all the time.
"
6,17,Kyle,"Dude, where have you been?
"
4,2,Kyle,"Two years?
"
4,9,Cartman,"...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!
"
7,9,Stan,"Wugh, dude. I can't wait to just go back home and get back to band practice.
"
15,10,Stan,"That was a private e-mail from me to you!  Hey Wendy.
"
1,5,Stan,"At least I'm not a little pigfucker!
"
6,8,Randy,"Well uh, let's, let's just be atheists.
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Estoy seguro que llegáran. Eh-solo poquito mas de tiempo, ¿mbien? (I'm sure the choir will be here. We just need a little more time)
"
5,8,Stan,"The 2001 Okama GameSphere?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Nobody.
"
13,10,Jimmy,"Oh, I'm sorry.
"
1,7,Kyle,"But the zombies are coming!
"
4,1,Stan,"Deal with it, dude! Cartman's gone, so now you're the fat kid.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey!
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, that was total carnage!
"
7,14,Stan,"Jimmy, will you go talk to Wendy for me?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Get online now!
"
7,4,Cartman,"It's a bitch, ain't it?
"
7,1,Stan,"Why?? Because you're playing with people's lives! You're turning people's problems into entertainment!
"
1,12,Cartman,"It is?
"
18,7,Butters,"What?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Well, let's just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence on the board, and I want you to tell me the noun. 
"
10,3,Kyle,"Dad? Are you sure there's time?
"
14,1,Butters,"Oh no!
"
3,4,Stan,"Yeah, it was weak.
"
13,3,Kyle,"Heunh. 
"
13,6,Randy,"Wha?! Finland?! 
"
10,1,Kyle,"Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, what's up dawg?
"
10,9,Stan,"Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
"
6,10,Cartman,"But I wanna plaaayyy.
"
6,16,Randy,"Stan! Stan! Oh. Okay, uh, you you might be wondering why Butters has a future self, too.
"
7,3,Kyle,"We have to confess that we were the ones that-
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"Well, I hope you learned that throwing rocks is bad, Eric.
"
1,9,Mr. Mackey,"And that must make you mad.
"
17,2,Randy,"Oh come on! You can't block your parents from watching informative murder porn! What? You, you think if we watch shows about married people killing each other all the time we're gonna go out and do it?! That's stupid!  I'm not gonna go out and kill your mom just because I watch Investigate Discovery, Stan! It'd be impossible to clear away all the DNA evidence anyway! Even if I hired someone else to kill her, I'd have to kill that person too, because 96% of the time that person eventually tells the truth! I thought this through a lot!  Stan?  You're a lousy kid! I wish Jaden Smith was my son! 
"
17,8,Butters,"Wha-what do you want me to do?
"
4,2,Kyle,"I am nothing, and everything.
"
10,13,Cartman,"Oh very funny, Kyle!
"
2,12,Randy,"No, she is. 
"
12,13,Kyle,"What? Are you crazy?
"
9,6,Butters,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
"
3,17,Kyle,"Alright, dickhole! 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit, now what are we gonna do?!
"
7,9,Cartman,"I'm going to kill you one day, Token.
"
4,3,Kyle,"Whoa. 
"
7,11,Kyle,"Because Butters isn't a total dick to me!
"
4,15,Cartman,"Alright, they're gone!  The Cartman store is open! 
"
6,13,Randy,"Hmmm, that gets rid of them.
"
16,5,Stan,"Hey guys, guys! Don't pick on Butters! That's not cool. You can't do that. Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh,  over 200,000 students every day are afraid to come to school because of bullying?  At South Park Elementary we're better than that. Come on. Let's all put an end to bullying. Right now! Five Six Seven Eight!
"
5,13,Cartman,"Oh, I guess you don't watch the news, Kyle!
"
12,10,Kenny,"(Jesus Christ, he fucking shot that guy!)
"
11,8,Cartman,"Yes. It's all finally come to fruition.  The final cog in my... master plan.  This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air.  Despicable things. And people will call me brave.
"
1,13,Cartman,"You will? Wow, you guys are the best! Thank you guys!
"
6,4,Stan,"So we can't let 'em die, douchebag! You're our friend; now come help us!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Nope. We wanna show the world how healthy your food is. Our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at Shitty Wok.
"
6,7,Butters,"Ah, my faithful companion in world destruction, General Disarray.
"
6,10,Stan,"...Wait, what were we doing again?
"
14,9,Randy,"Yup. They're from Jersey alright.
"
15,9,Butters,"Nothing can stop me, and my pride, in Mother Meheeco!
"
6,7,Butters,"Oh yes! I have plotted for weeks, and figured that if we build a huge ...wooden shade eighty feet high, a-and fifty feet wide , precisely on this hill, South Park ...will forever be cast in a great shadow.
"
1,7,Kyle,"Everyone came as Chewbacca?!
"
10,12,Cartman,"Noo!! Nooo!!
"
2,9,Kyle,"Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Eh.  Eh. Yeah.  Well hello?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"I do.
"
18,5,Randy,"Heheh, Gerald is watching Housewives of Atlanta.
"
12,1,Kyle,"NO!
"
15,10,Stan,"What the hell? A stupid rat is in charge of Eavesdropper?
"
15,4,Randy,"Oh dear.
"
14,4,Stan,"Yahtzee?
"
17,8,Stan,"The Princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that Playstations are better, she'll consider it.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Clyde, are you aware of what Turd Sandwich can bring to our school?
"
13,13,Cartman,"Oh. My. Goodddd.
"
10,13,Cartman,"I'll miss you too, COCKA-3.
"
1,2,Stan,"Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet.
"
5,7,Kyle,"What's this all about, Kenny?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Well, I mean it could have just been a dog?
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear!
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Are you nuts? If Muhammad appears in South Park, we get bombed! 
"
10,8,Kyle,"It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. 
"
7,11,Kyle,"Oh. Well... yeah. I, I did.
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Right, desks. Well, a lot of cuts had to be made since the school's funding is short for lawsuits.
"
2,7,Stan,"I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
"
18,3,Wendy,"WHAT?!
"
10,10,Cartman,"Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!
"
12,13,Stan,"You guys, this High School Musical thing isn't gonna go away. I think we'd better just get on board with it.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Haaaa! Haaaa!
"
6,13,Randy,"What's a video stockyard, Jimmy?
"
3,1,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Why?
"
15,8,Butters,"Jeez, we're out of finished burgers again, Eric. We need more.
"
15,11,Randy,"Fine! He wants to bro down?! I'll bro down! 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey!
"
2,16,Stan,"Please, I don't wanna go back with them.
"
5,1,Cartman,"You guys, look here.  In this Nancy Drew mystery, Nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe. This could explain how Kyle got it in his vagina.
"
6,6,Butters,"Oh yeah. I hadn't thought o' that. That's a pretty good idea. I'll go get a hammer.  Hey, who is that? 
"
12,10,Randy,"Sharon, you're gonna be really glad I have all this footage of the family someday.
"
14,7,Cartman,"You are a race of beady-eyed thieves, Kyle, who throughout the millennia have squirmed and worked your way into the dark cubbyholes of society.  Where exactly did the Jews first get their power and how are they able to manipulate our minds today?
"
16,2,Kyle,"Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says ""Cash For Gold and Jewelry."" There must be a lot of people doin' it.
"
5,1,Kyle,"Now what?
"
2,18,Kenny,"(Well, I think you guys should name it Steve)
"
3,17,Kenny,"(Ready.)  (Oh,  shiiit. Damnit! Cartman, I've got to go to the bathroom!) 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Man, these calves smell like crap! I don't see how you're gonna hide them from your mom much longer.
"
14,4,Stan,"Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
"
13,5,Cartman,"Alright, well maybe I can help you, you know, we can totally write some stuff together.
"
2,14,Cartman,"Four.
"
9,4,Cartman,"Kenny, when did you get here?
"
10,4,Cartman,"Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!
"
9,6,Butters,"Ruh, really?
"
3,16,Stan,"Hey assholes! 
"
2,16,Stan,"You look a lot bigger than the last time we saw you.
"
1,10,Mr. Garrison,"Say 'hi' to Damien!  And where are you from, Damien?
"
4,17,Stan,"...It's okay. We'll just have his character die in the film. 
"
7,14,Butters,"Well go ahead and go. It's best we don't say anything more. There's nothing left to say. It's over.  Our relationship is o-over.
"
15,4,Randy,"We're back, we're back, we're back back back!
America is back!
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, interesting, Token, Uh... Who would like to go next?  Uh how about someone who didn't write about how cool Bebe is?
"
1,1,Stan,"Thanks for your help, Wendy.
"
3,2,Cartman,"Officer Barbrady! 
"
12,14,Butters,"Oh God I think they're gonna drink blood now. They've got some kind of chalice, and they're  uhn... 
"
11,14,Kyle,"I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
"
12,13,Wendy,"East side, west side, whatever side that you're on. 
"
3,17,Stan,"Damnit Cartman, wha-?!
"
3,15,Stan,"It fell;
"
12,7,Kyle,"Come on, this is serious!
"
1,9,Kyle,"No, dude!
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"I seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore.
"
13,14,Stan,"Who are you?
"
11,1,Randy,"What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money.
"
2,13,Kyle,"You think?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"What? Fo-for real?
"
5,3,Stan,"Okay, it's all clear. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can't I move?!
"
1,10,Cartman,"Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now.  And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy. Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-... Ants In The Pants? Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS? 
"
2,11,Stan,"Dude, this isn't right.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Thirty-three aborted fetuses.  Oh yes.
"
13,8,Kyle,"Aww crap!
"
7,6,Butters,"No!
"
12,9,Butters,"Eric. Hey Eric.  Eric, wha-what's goin' on? Everyone is startin' to say you got detention on purpose to get out of fightin' Wendy.
"
2,7,Stan,"Dude!
"
16,14,Kyle,"It matters, Stan. It it matters.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...
"
17,6,Stan,"Well whatever it is, we have to figure it out. I think all those farts are starting to get to Kyle's head.
"
7,13,Stan,"So it's either deal with all that, or be grounded for three weeks. 
"
11,1,Randy,"What's going on here?
"
6,11,Randy,"No, no. You know who was right all along? The Mongolians.  They knew that you just can't wall yourself off from the outside world. Putting walls up never helps anything. Tearing them down brings us together.
"
2,9,Stan,"Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie.
"
6,2,Butters,"Do you think Stan has a chance?  Uh go Stan! 
"
11,14,Stan,"...Abe Lincoln?
"
5,10,Mr. Garrison,"Wow, I never realized Ben had TPS, but I definitely see the resemblance now. 
"
13,11,Cartman,"Shhh, Kenny...  Old Ken is taking it especially hard. He's always loved dolphins so much that he-  Yeah yeah but, but keep it in a two-shot, though.  Yeah, keep it there.  He's always loved dolphins so much that he would do anything.
"
10,14,Stan,"Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?
"
6,16,Stan,"Hey future self.
"
8,3,Stan,"Warp drive disengaged. Landing sequence initiated.
"
6,3,Cartman,"What-evah! What-evah!  I'll do what I waunt!
"
4,14,Timmy,"TIM-MIH! 
"
11,7,Randy,"Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars.
"
12,7,Butters,"Well, that's your problem!
"
5,14,Butters,"Hm. Uh-I can't think of one.
"
9,5,Butters,"Oh no!
"
8,8,Cartman,"A turd sandwich.
"
14,4,Stan,"Fuckin' Yahtzee again? Seriously? 
"
1,12,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
18,6,Kyle,"Oh. Really?
"
4,11,Timmy,"Haghh.
"
9,6,Butters,"Well I think... I'm like the kid in that movie! I-I'm seeing dead people!
"
1,5,Cartman,"That'll do pig.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Goddammit..! 
"
4,10,Cartman,"Oh, this guy is so gonna burn!
"
5,7,Cartman,"I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!
"
13,9,Butters,"In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.
"
4,14,Mr. Garrison,"And now, here it is. The touching story of Helen Keller, ""The Miracle Worker."" 
"
5,4,Cartman,"I'm Eric Cartman!
"
3,16,Cartman,"...Okay, that makes sense. Mine is going swimmingly, too.
"
5,10,Stan,"No way! 
"
1,1,Kyle,"Chef, have you ever had something happen to you, but nobody believed you?
"
10,2,Cartman,"Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
"
3,3,Kenny,"{And a real huge dick.}
"
16,10,Randy,"Oh, come on, he can't be trying that with all our wives?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Okay, how about this: Adam Sandler... inherits like, a billion dollars, but first, he has to, like, become a... boxer, or something.
"
17,5,Kyle,"That system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc!
"
1,7,Wendy,"But Stan!
"
7,13,Mr. Mackey,"What??
"
5,7,Stan,"Yeah.  Hey Wendy, did you guys get-
"
16,12,Stan,"Listen everybody, those guys right over there are- 
"
10,12,Butters,"Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
"
4,13,Kyle,"He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--
"
5,8,Stan,"Who is that? 
"
17,7,Jimmy,"Ya yo you can't, you can't do that.
"
1,5,Cartman,"I would never let a woman kick my ass.  If she tried anything, I'd be like, ""hey, you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen, and make me some pie!""
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"It sure is, Mr. Hat. 
"
16,5,Stan,"I'll do it! I'll be in charge.
"
7,14,Stan,"Dude, please. I might still have a chance to make things work. Please, just go talk to her?
"
6,7,Cartman,"Ha ha! 
"
1,5,Kyle,"No! We're already halfway done.
"
8,8,Stan,"I'll live with you.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Primary engine running?
"
12,8,Butters,"Well sure.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Dude... Token!  Token. Dude.  Psst. Token.  Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Token! Yeah, get in there.
"
16,12,Randy,"Oh hahahaha, I get it. Blockbuster is so out of date it's ancient. Haha Sharon, okay I get it.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Oh, balls!
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"You know, I, I feel like I can start anew. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go back to teaching the third grade!
"
5,3,Kyle,"You're Stan? Where's Kenny?
"
18,6,Randy,"You didn't realize! What are ""Canadian coins""?
"
10,3,Cartman,"Come to try and stop me?!  It isn't gonna work. 
"
13,9,Butters,"Gals. Gals, could you all come gather round? Gather round, gals; take a knee.  Gals, I... well I'm afraid I can't do this anymore. I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"O-kay, is there anyone who can answer the question?
"
10,6,Stan,"Huh? What? Have they come for us?
"
1,2,Wendy,"Hello?  My essay by Eric Cartman: ""When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of...""
"
2,12,Cartman,"Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Fuckin' gay as hell. 
"
1,3,Cartman,"I was just trying to scare you guys, you can put the guns down now.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Are you HIV-positive?  Aarrhh! Ow, fuck, Kyle!
"
8,1,Butters,"Hi Mom.  -a castaway, forced to live his life out in solitude.  And it's because of times like these I was forced to a life of evil.  Society cast me out, and so I vowed to make them all pay! And pay they did! Nobody knows that beneath this sweet eight-year-old little boy lies the most evil, the most destructive super-villain of all time!  Professor Chaos!  Let's see how you like dealing with me, ninjas! 
"
1,10,Cartman,"That's right.
"
6,10,Stan,"Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.
"
18,2,Wendy,"You broke up with me, Stan! You said you had to be ""free to chase your dreams"".
"
16,14,Kyle,"All right, where are the missing ballots?!  President Obama?
"
7,8,Kyle,"Thanks.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Okay okay, shushushuh, okay, shush, check it out. Uh hey there Clyde.
"
1,3,Cartman,"Drive, Drive!
"
10,7,Cartman,"Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Dude. That's a pretty fucked up dream.
"
2,13,Kyle,"We did it! You see, Cartman? You won us the Terrance and Phillip dolls!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Well, I dreamt that I was lying in my bed…  in the dark. When all of a sudden this bright blue light filled the room . Then slowly my bedroom door begin to open  and the next thing I remember I was being drug through a hallway.  Then these scary hands wanted to operate on me.  And they had big heads and big black eyes…
"
2,6,Stan,"Yeah.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Mom?! Where is Ike?!
"
3,16,Stan,"You did?
"
2,14,Cartman,"You wrote it?
"
3,8,Randy,"Okay, I'll start. 
"
3,11,Kenny,"(To pay for the pockets on his peehole) 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Yeheah, we're wired up!
"
12,2,Kyle,"Huh? 
"
8,12,Wendy,"Oh, well, you wanna maybe go to the art museum?
"
10,13,Cartman,"Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!
"
13,12,Cartman,"I think what I'm gonna do is uh, find out wherever their bikes are and uh, crap on their seats.
"
3,1,Kyle,"Hey, Craig.
"
17,9,Kenny,"Minna-san, ii yo. Purincessu Kenni ganbaru. 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Why? Did you find something?
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Okay uh van Gelder-
"
5,8,Stan,"You called us and said if we brought the towel you'd give us our video game back.
"
12,4,Kyle,"Huh? Well we don't really have that much money.
"
2,14,Cartman,"We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef.  Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!
"
9,12,Stan,"But I'm completely miserable and these people can help!
"
15,8,Kyle,"You wanna bet?  Let's go ask my Dad right now!
"
18,7,Butters,"OH GOSH!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Alright. I promise. I won't let the black people riot and destroy the world.
"
6,1,Randy,"Yeah! That has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever! 
"
17,2,Randy,"That felt so good!
"
6,3,Butters,"Aaahhh well, aaahmm, ...I guess they call me uh, Chinball Boy, and uh, Ballchin Boy, nnnd when I, when I'm walkin' they'll say, ""Hey, there goes Chinballs!"" 
"
6,1,Stan,"Shut up, Butters, it's your own damned fault.
"
3,14,Kyle,"Yeah. Thanks, dick!
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"The audience is supposed to feel scared of tooth decay, Kyle! Hukay?! If Tooth Decay has no believability, then Tooth Past and Dental Floss have nothing to play against!
"
1,1,Stan,"Bleech!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Let me have time with him.
"
17,3,Stan,"That sure wasn't much of a zombie apocalypse.
"
16,13,Stan,"We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.
"
9,6,Stan,"Cartman isn't our friend anymore. 
"
8,9,Stan,"Three tickets to Bentonville, Arkansas, please.
"
18,9,Cartman,"Uhh, so today I'm gonna comment on Call Of Duty.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Man, this stuff is strong.
"
13,1,Stan,"Yeah, dude, Tammy Warner. She's a fifth grader.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Standing right here, let's go, bitch.
"
1,7,Stan,"He hasn't moved an inch, or said anything.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Huh?
"
5,3,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
15,7,Kyle,"No, they're penguins! Stop it!
"
4,10,Mr. Mackey,"-m'kay. The God of Jacob is our refuge, m'kay. 
"
5,1,Stan,"I can't believe they actually said it. 
"
1,1,Kyle,"Cartman, you do have pinkeye!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.
"
7,11,Kyle,"It's too late, fatass.  They'll be here in less than a minute.
"
15,2,Cartman,"He could do everything. I saw Funnybot on ""Nurse Jackie"" and on ""Rockin' The Boat.""
"
10,1,Cartman,"Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!
"
1,5,Stan,"Okay.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Could I please one of your piping-hot farts in my mouth?
"
15,8,Kyle,"You said ""fuck you"" to my face, Stan.
"
1,10,Stan,"You're leaving already?
"
4,10,Cartman,"You're doing unnatural things in the house of God!
"
11,1,Randy,"Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you.
"
18,6,Butters,"Congratulations, Kyle.
"
8,8,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay... that's one more vote for Turd Sandwich.
"
10,4,Cartman,"It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!
"
12,14,Butters,"I can take you... to the place where kids are being transformed into vampires. 
"
2,12,Cartman,"Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?
"
12,8,Butters,"No!
"
6,14,Stan,"Butters!
"
8,14,Stan,"Oh, good.
"
3,5,Stan,"Why don't we just tell our parents?
"
11,10,Cartman,"Kyle, suck my balls. 
"
14,4,Randy,"...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"Excellent. ""A-"".
"
3,14,Stan,"Dude, that's not cool.
"
8,2,Kyle,"What?
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Very good, Kyle. Now, who can tell me what famous person wrote the Declaration of Independence?  Let's see. Oh, I know. How about the new student, Timmy? 
"
7,4,Kyle,"I-I don't know.
"
7,7,Randy,"He... he lost his house to the Native Americans.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"I'm not saying the rest of the school year will be easy. In fact, it's going to be long and hard.  Really long and really hard. 
"
1,5,Kyle,"We need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant, but their genes won't splice.
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
2,11,Kyle,"Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!
"
8,14,Kyle,"With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!
"
18,6,Stan,"Yeah, no, this is great.
"
3,2,Kyle,"I guess not.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"What- what am I supposed to s-say?
"
8,3,Cartman,"You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don't understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew. It has made people the world over open their eyes.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"All right! I I keep getting an erection for no reason! Okay! But I can't get any of the girls here to let me... do it to them.
"
18,1,Stan,"I don't know, I... But I don't know if my future is with this company either.
"
10,2,Butters,"Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-
"
1,13,Cartman,"Eeeyy!
"
13,4,Cartman,"What the fuck is this?!
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"And now, Randy Marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war.
"
2,11,Stan,"We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything.
"
5,3,Stan,"That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay.
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"Aw, damnit, I'm in the wrong place. 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Wow! I guess Cartman really did take care of them.
"
3,5,Kyle,"Dude, this sucks ass!
"
4,14,Timmy,"Timmy.
"
12,8,Cartman,"The Chinese are gonna take us over, Butters! And we are the only people who seem to care!
"
15,8,Kyle,"Yes!
"
3,13,Stan,"Aw, man, if you have to.
"
2,4,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford.
"
7,5,Cartman,"And that is my presentation on Latinos in the arts. Thank you. 
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Go? We still have over fifty awards to hand out.
"
6,4,Kyle,"'Cause they're gonna get slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!
"
8,2,Cartman,"...I could pile at Shakey's, heck.  Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!
"
14,4,Stan,"Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you.
"
11,2,Cartman,"I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow.
"
1,5,Kyle,"I'll bet you can't.
"
7,1,Kyle,"No, Ike! You can't come to school with me. 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Guys! Guys?  Can anybody hear me? You guys??  Token, Token, I'm here!  Hello! Hello! Hello!  Clyde, can't you feel me?  Feel me, Clyde!  Jimmy! Jimmy, it's me, Eric!  Jimmy!  Can't you feel your hair move?! That's me!  They don't even know yet, that one of their best friends is dead.  Dead and... still wandering the earth a lost soul.
"
13,7,Cartman,"What?!
"
6,15,Stan,"No, that's Kenny.
"
6,13,Stan,"Closed?
"
17,5,Stan,"He doesn't ever want to play with you anymore?
"
13,10,Stan,"What?!
"
4,11,Stan,"What worked?
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh no, China, we get to keep the ship. Because we killed the alien, you boner! Oh-oh come on England, you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else!  Oh crap it's the cops! Hang on.  Ah hey, space officers.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Hoh boy, here we go.
"
15,13,Cartman,"Uhhh??
"
5,5,Kyle,"Uhuh, but that's why we're going.
"
3,4,Stan,"All right. Tweek, we'll teach you how to fight, and Cartman, you teach Craig.
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Yeah dude, I looove NASCAR.)
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Hey! Just what the hell do you think you're doing, Eric?! '
"
12,10,Kyle,"Look, we're from Colorado! We, we grew up in the United States.
"
3,6,Cartman,"Where's that?
"
13,10,Kyle,"I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do.  And I, again, am alone. 
"
18,1,Stan,"Why don't we just call it ""Untitled Startup Company""?
"
15,12,Jimmy,"Now hold on a second, fellas. If you're the 83%, then our class is only 17%.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Get close to him!  How much do I owe you?
"
4,10,Kenny,"(Fuck! Oops!) 
"
4,9,Wendy,"Yeah!
"
2,13,Cartman,"I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!
"
8,12,Butters,"Loo loo loo, let's make some applesauce, take off our clothes and loo loo loo!
"
6,10,Cartman,"Yes, that's a good Precious. Okay, now it puts the lotion back in the basket.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fuckin' head open!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Get online. I need you to check something for me.
"
7,14,Stan,"What's the matter with you?
"
3,10,Stan,"...Ye-eah.
"
7,3,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
6,4,Kyle,"But we will have to sleep, dude.
"
6,5,Stan,"Dude, the commercials could start any time!
"
3,3,Kyle,"Yeah.  Oh, here he comes.
"
7,9,Stan,"Hey, it's that Lars Ulrich guy!
"
7,4,Kyle,"Shut up and study!
"
4,4,Stan,"Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.
"
5,2,Cartman,"Cripple fight! 
"
7,8,Kyle,"GRRRRR!!
"
12,8,Cartman,"One of the cops is Chinese! Son of a bitch, how high up does this thing go? We can't trust anybody here, Butters!  Don't come any closer! We have information that that we will only trust with the President of the United States!
"
3,14,Stan,"Yes, and I'm Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy.
"
1,3,Cartman,"Hey you guys. I know a scary story.
"
11,14,Cartman,"You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!
"
7,8,Kyle,"They aren't gay? Then what are they?
"
2,15,Cartman,"What's wrong with me? Let's see. Uum.  I hate you guys. You're hella stupid.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Come on, you know. He's losing it. He's gonna crack.
"
5,10,Kyle,"Everything turned out okay for those people. And so now you can laugh.
"
12,9,Wendy,"What is your problem?! Breast cancer isn't funny!
"
2,11,Cartman,"Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
13,9,Cartman,"Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?
"
14,5,Randy,"Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. 
"
17,6,Cartman,"Hey, everyone? Excuse me!  Everybody, can I just have a second of your time, please? Everyone, listen up.  Listen everybody, I uh... I owe Kyle a big apology and I... I wanna do it in fromt of everyone because... ugh... I was wrong, Kyle.
"
14,2,Cartman,"Shhh.  Be right with you.  We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed.
"
3,6,Kyle,"Isn't that fascism?
"
13,13,Cartman,"You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
"
12,4,Stan,"We're the ones you told to get Internet money.
"
7,12,Randy,"Well it's just that... the Harrisons are really nice people and... you should see how loving and together their family is. I, I think there's something to that religion.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Oh, uh, well, personally, I... uhuhuhuh, I... don't like Animaniacs?
"
14,2,Randy,"""He took a- and then-"" Oh, man. Oh, this- 
"
2,13,Kyle,"Damnit, I have to have those dolls! 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"So, when your penis becomes hard, you're supposed to put in in a lady's vagina. And then it stops being hard?
"
16,5,Stan,"Well come on, do you just wanna be bullied your whole life, Butters?  Kyle?
"
10,7,Cartman,"Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! 
"
5,10,Kyle,"Butters! Hey Butters!
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, boy, we're free!  Wow, what a daring rescue.  Mr. Hat!  Mr. Hat saved us, Chef!  Come on, let's get in the truck! I'll drive from here, Mr. Hat.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Su navi per mari)
"
10,6,Kyle,"What do ManBearPig droppings look like?
"
6,6,Kyle,"Pip  Jimmy  Jason  Towelie  Luigi .
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"I'm telling you, this is all a terrible mistake, Officer Barbrady.
"
5,12,Kyle,"Yeah. We're guys, dude. We find something about all our friends to rip on. We made fun of you for being rich just like we make fun of Butters for being wimpy.
"
9,13,Kyle,"But... we were so close... I'm sorry, Willzy-x. We tried.
"
5,3,Stan,"Your my Super Best Friend too, Kyle.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Alright, alright, I'm sorry I almost got you guys all raped. There.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Uh-tu-Timmih!
"
7,6,Stan,"Thanks.
"
16,11,Kyle,"What?
"
11,9,Randy,"Courics...
"
12,6,Stan,"Aw man! 
"
16,8,Butters,"That's true. Old Eric tells me I should work at a Thai massage parlor, I'm so good at sucking.
"
13,10,Butters,"Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!
"
8,9,Stan,"Come on, Dad!
"
6,2,Randy,"Well, this certainly is nice.
"
5,6,Cartman,"I thought you said buying a theme park was stupid! SECURITY!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Now everyone was there. We thought things would start getting fun, but... that's when we had to watch the safety video. 
"
14,5,Cartman,"You just had seven tacos.
"
9,11,Stan,"You mean,you're a ginger?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math.
"
4,9,Stan,"You were great, Dad.
"
1,8,Kyle,"This is our new Ethernopian, Starvin' Marvin. 
"
17,6,Butters,"Let's go get the kindergartners. Uh they're gonna wanna see this too! 
"
6,1,Butters,"Wull I can't eat no more. I-I just keep pukin' it up.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Oh, I've got a better idea! Why don't you go across the street and buy some condoms?! Because we should at least be safe if you're gonna fuck me, Mom!
"
8,11,Stan,"...Bail. 
"
17,6,Kyle,"Oh no. Nohoho no. Cartman, don;t you do this! The Middle East is finally at peace!
"
12,8,Cartman,"This is it, Butters. We have to be strong. We're taking down those God damned Chinese right now.  Things could get ugly in there, Butters. We've got to infiltrate, and find out the Chinese invasion plans. 
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Sure!)
"
7,1,Cartman,"What the Funk & Wagnalls are you talkin' about?
"
18,5,Butters,"No! Nono! I'm sorry. Thank you Eric! I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy! Thanks for covering my ass!
"
8,7,Randy,"Oh my God. They took my jarb!!
"
2,6,Stan,"Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.
"
5,7,Randy,"Yeah! Let's get that damned school on the phone! 
"
8,10,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
4,16,Kyle,"But you didn't do anything to me.
"
4,12,Cartman,"I'm trying.
"
2,16,Stan,"Yeah, right!
"
6,13,Cartman,"Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
"
5,7,Kyle,"It says you gotta check it for holes or tears.
"
12,14,Cartman,"Dude, gross, you got spit all over my neck! Mom! Butters just gave me a hickey!
"
14,9,Cartman,"Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Really?
"
11,12,Stan,"Well you have to convince them they are real!
"
6,8,Stan,"Cartman shoved food up his ass and now he's tryin' to crap out his mouth.
"
16,12,Stan,"Oh, ah thank God you found me.
"
2,12,Cartman,"And stop your bitchin'!
"
6,13,Cartman,"The one tape must be returned!  Run! 
"
5,9,Stan,"Oh uh, and here.  Take this American flag as... a gift. 
"
16,5,Butters,"Nno Grandma, knock it off! No! Stop it! 
"
5,4,Kyle,"Cartman, can I give you some advice?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Okay, it's clear. 
"
13,14,Randy,"I don't know! The whole water park has been quarantined! They're worried anyone left alive could be... sssome kind of raging, hate-filled mutants.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Come on guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! 
"
15,5,Kyle,"Dude, this is probably the best episode they've ever done!
"
15,7,Stan,"Agh, that shitty game? Who plays video games to listen to a bunch of characters talk and press the X button?
"
18,1,Butters,"Yeah, we can do it, fellas! It'll be like old times!
"
5,13,Stan,"Dude, it looks like Cartman and Kenny are ditching school again.
"
1,13,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
5,13,Stan,"...but... the doctors are gonna make him better, right?
"
9,6,Butters,"Mrs. Cartman?
"
9,10,Kyle,"Impress Wendy??
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Uh oh.)
"
16,14,Kyle,"Well keep looking.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Yes, yes, I think that's a good idea, guys. Let's give Michael Jordan a call about that.  Ah, now, where were we?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?
"
14,9,Kyle,"Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!
"
14,14,Stan,"Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels.
"
8,11,Butters,"Oh, boy!
"
5,2,Stan,"Hey Jimmy, do you wanna join our bake sale in South Park tomorrow?
"
17,8,Randy,"You're gonna have to walk slower than that. You've got a while.
"
10,12,Cartman,"Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?
"
15,5,Butters,"I like that boom boom pow
Them chicks be jackin my style
They try and copy my swagger
I'm on that next shit now
I'm so 2008You so 2000 and late
I got that boom boom boom
That future boom boom boom
Let me get it now
"
11,10,Stan,"What is this place?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Meh. 
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Look, it's all about context. Well, for example, recently, I have come out and admitted that I was a homosexual. I'm gay. That means that now I can say the word, ""fag"". On television they usually don't allow ""fag"". But because I'm gay, it's alright. And with the new approval of the word, ""shit,"" that means that finally I am free to say,Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?Hey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,Shitty shitty fag fag, how do you do? Oh this is great!
"
6,7,Butters,"Simple, my dear general.  We are going to block out the sun!
"
5,6,Stan,"Yeah, awesome!
Kenny
panting(You guy! You guys! You gotta come down to Cartman's house! You hear Cartman got a million dollars from his Grandma!)
"
12,13,Cartman,"What the hell are they doing?
"
8,8,Stan,"Aaaah!! 
"
8,11,Stan,"Hey wha-b-but we gave it our best.
"
4,7,Stan,"Alright, alright, here. 
"
10,2,Kyle,"Yeah, I guess so.
"
14,9,Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler.  Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh?  He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!
"
2,12,Cartman,"No, Kenny.
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Well, Timmy, as your counselor, I want you to know that you can tell me anything, m'kay? And whatever's troublin' you, I wanna try and, and help you with it.
"
14,2,Kyle,"What?! 
"
6,15,Kyle,"You're right, Stan. My Grandma isn't floating around, judging me and watching what I do. She's dead. Dead and gone forever.
"
11,1,Cartman,"Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times.
"
1,6,Kenny,"(Ow!)
"
1,10,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Why?!  Why?! Why did you have to take them both?! Why?!  Why?! 
"
3,2,Cartman,"...When I get all my superpowers, I'm gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet!  Dude, superpowers are sweet.
"
4,17,Stan,"We can't do it without him, Kyle. We've already animated him in it!
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Come in, m'kay.
"
6,11,Kyle,"Dude, we weren't playing anybody.
"
13,7,Kyle,"I'll call you back. 
"
15,8,Kyle,"Hey, Stan!
"
15,10,Stan,"Knock it off! 
"
16,9,Stan,"Whoa duude!
"
6,7,Butters,"Excellent, General Disarray! Now we can begin my most horrible evil plan yet to wreak havoc on humanity. 
"
11,5,Stan,"Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!
"
4,9,Cartman,"I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
"
1,11,Stan,"Oh, no, Mr. Garrison's back.
"
9,14,Randy,"I'm Randy and I'm an alcoholic.
"
7,8,Randy,"Mr. Garrison!  Hey doll.
"
4,17,Kyle,"If you guys want there to be a Christmas, you'd better come help me!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Who's there?!  Lock that door behind you, Token.  Black people live here! 
"
11,12,Kyle,"You have to stop!
"
5,7,Cartman,"Well, I guess now that that's out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy!  That's it. Red rocket, red rocket. Come on, now. Come on, red rocket, dog. Red rocket now.
"
10,8,Randy,"Stan!
"
14,2,Butters,"Aww. Dangit. 
"
12,14,Stan,"Dude, aw! Who's using the flak jacket cheat?!
"
11,12,Butters,"I'm trying!
"
11,13,Randy,"Well you kids wanna see something really cool?  Check this out. 
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high.
Though my eyes could see I-
"
10,3,Randy,"SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people.  Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore.
"
3,3,Stan,"Yeah! She's evil and wants to suck Chef's life out of him
"
1,1,Cartman,"Dildo!
"
12,9,Butters,"She chickened out!
"
9,6,Cartman,"...What did you say?
"
7,9,Cartman,"GOD DAMMIT!! 
"
13,5,Jimmy,"It was just a-
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Then why does God make it so that my penis gets hard if girls don't wanna have it in their vaginas? It's like a cruel joke.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Oh, that was close.
"
1,7,Stan,"I don't wanna trick-or-treat with you. You lied to me.
"
15,10,Stan,"What?
"
7,7,Randy,"But how can they do that?!
"
16,2,Stan,"But, how do they get away with that?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Sure. I know the p-perfect place.
"
3,10,Kyle,"So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
"
4,3,Randy,"Uh-oh.
"
12,8,Kyle,"Did you see it?
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Sure.
"
1,3,Cartman,"My weenies won't cook.
"
2,18,Stan,"I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
"
16,8,Randy,"How's it going? Awesome! Nobody's getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons! 'Cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Rrrrr-laurlaurlah Timmehah!  Timmehuh!  Timmehh.
"
15,7,Cartman,"Yaaaay!
"
18,2,Randy,"That's my son, you bastard!
"
4,14,Cartman,"No no! 
"
16,6,Kenny,"(This is not herpes, it's a cold sore!)
"
13,4,Stan,"It was so gross, Dad, I mean, what if another girl at school tries-?
"
5,6,Cartman,"Nuh uh, I'm spendin' it.
"
2,6,Kyle,"Cartman! What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!
"
12,6,Stan,"It's gotta be our turn soon.
"
6,13,Stan,"There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Lame...
"
16,8,Butters,"My wiener is all stiff and pointy!
"
11,1,Randy,"Huh?
"
8,4,Stan,"Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn't your fault
"
3,2,Randy,"It's all about moderation. If you never fart, you combust, but if you always fart, you deplete the ozone. So we must fart only at appropriate times or when it's really, really funny.
"
8,7,Stan,"That's right! 
"
17,1,Cartman,"I don't know.
"
8,5,Butters,"Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We're makin' all sorts of money for the poor.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Kenny'll believe whatever you want him to.
"
12,4,Stan,"This is going great!
"
16,13,Stan,"It all just happened so fast. The next thing I knew I had a Nike commercial.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Jesus Christ!  Okay, okay.  Um, Jesus-  ah... Okay, look.  Okay those, those tests we took last week? The state efficiency tests? How did we do on those?
"
2,8,Stan,"We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Good.
"
2,2,Kyle,"Whoa, dude!
"
9,10,Stan,"Yeah, well, so is your hat. 
"
14,8,Butters,"All those ladies have stinky vaginas?
"
12,3,Butters,"Aww, come on. Kenny knows how dangerous cheesing is.
"
8,10,Cartman,"You guys, what the fuck are we gonna do?! In case you've forgotten, Trent Boyett is the meanest kid we ever knew. He's gonna tear us apart!
"
12,4,Cartman,"No! NOOO!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Go!!! Does Cleveland like to rock?! Go!!! Yes, damnit!
"
12,14,Stan,"What?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Kyle, when have I ever ripped on you for being a Jew?
"
17,2,Kyle,"You know why! Because we're trying to keep our parents from watching murder porn!
"
12,14,Butters,"You can't ground me! For I am neither living nor dead! How can thy ground that which is... ungroundable. 
"
8,10,Stan,"What's that?
"
17,8,Cartman,"There's another army out there who thinks they're better than us, and we are not going to be beat by that traitor whore Kenny! Get back to training! 
"
1,5,Kyle,"Uh…yeah…we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig.
"
1,11,Kyle,"Dude, you had waffles for breakfast, huh?!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Of course I am. This isn't about you. This is about CartmanBrah, brah.
"
6,1,Cartman,"and a lifetime of free food at City Wok.
"
13,1,Stan,"I still can't believe it, even though it's right there in front of me.
"
1,12,Stan,"Oh my God! Look! 
"
16,3,Cartman,"Oh, God. That was boring.
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"O-kay!  Kyle, is there anything you can do for the Christmas play that isn't related to Jesus?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Wait, hang on Butters!
"
7,9,Butters,"Oh, hi Eric.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Dear Mr. President. There are times when humans can no longer endure their government's authoritah. You must declare the Confederaceh its own nation so that we may enter into a new millennium of prosperitah. If you do not meet our demands, we will be forced to show the videotapes we have of you with Marisa Tomei.
"
5,5,Kenny,"(Aahhh!)
"
7,10,Randy,"Yes I know.
"
14,7,Butters,"You will?
"
5,11,Stan,"Book. Later, dude. 
"
6,4,Butters,"Oh Jeez, he said ""ass"" to his parents.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Thaaat's ri-ight.
"
10,12,Stan,"I wasn't talking about spaghetti. 
"
14,10,Stan,"The hell are you doing, dad?
"
16,6,Stan,"You guys, you guys! Get up! Listen to me! There's a lake a hundred yards down that way! They've got a marina with boats just sitting there!
"
14,7,Kyle,"Towelie, over the past few months I have watched you go from an ancillary character with a few amusing catchphrases to a dried out spooge rag covered in the jizz of a thousand older men.
"
4,2,Stan,"What does it look like we're doing, Butters? We need a tooth, so we're using Timmy's wheelchair to pull out one of Kenny's.
"
12,12,Kyle,"What the hell?  Ike?
"
2,18,Stan,"Ow!
"
4,6,Stan,"Dude, that's not cool. Don't give Kyle AIDS.
"
3,10,Stan,"What are these? They're Chinpokomon!
"
1,6,Stan,"Aww, do I have to?
"
18,9,Cartman,"Well this sucks. Looks like I'm in the principal's office for just commenting on things.
"
11,3,Kenny,"Dudes!
"
18,2,Cartman,"KYLE! IT'S ALL GONE! THEY'VE TAKEN IT ALL! WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS?! KYLE! KYLE!
"
2,6,Stan,"For what, dude?
"
6,14,Kyle,"Gays, I guess.
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Ah-I feel kinda nauseous.
"
16,13,Butters,"Stand ground, Mr. Mackey! 
"
2,15,Kyle,"Why?
"
4,15,Kyle,"Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
"
2,2,Kyle,"Really?
"
7,1,Kyle,"Yeah, and then Chef pulled up in his car. 
"
8,3,Cartman,"I want to thank you for all the blessings you have brought me. You have shown me the way so many times in the past and... now you are making all my dreams come true. You give me strength when there is doubt, and I praise you for all you have done.  Only you, Mel Gibson, have had the wisdom and the courage to show the world the truth. From this day forward I will dedicate my life to making sure your film is seen by everyone. I will organize the masses so that we may do thy bidding. Hail Mel Gibson. Amen.
"
2,12,Stan,"Dare.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Well, YOU don't, because you're a non-caring asshole, Cartman!
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Alright, boys, I now have all the information I need to teach you the female anatomy, hm'kay.  M'kay, this part here is the vaginal opening.  This is where the man puts his- Eric, what the hell are you doing?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison??
"
4,9,Randy,"Ohh, thanks.
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Good job, Wendy. And what was that document called?
"
2,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey?
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Well, he is a little ass-sucker. 
"
12,9,Butters,"Man it's almost time for school to start an' Wendy still isn't here.
"
14,4,Randy,"Stan, poke your grandma!
"
15,4,Randy,"Hello students, my name is Dr. Marsh, and I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday. How do a man and a woman... make a baby? Anybody? A man and woman, what do they do to make a baby? How about the little girl in the brown coat? Yeah you.
"
7,5,Cartman,"OW! OW! OH JESUS! OW!
"
11,13,Cartman,"Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh.
"
10,13,Cartman,"Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! 
"
12,10,Stan,"Hey, back off!
"
7,3,Kyle,"Well, okay.
"
3,11,Kyle,"You dumbass, Cartman! Now they're gonna go squeeze his balls!
"
3,14,Cartman,"I'll bet you can't.
"
2,6,Stan,"They're here! Hurry and hide! 
"
4,7,Cartman,"What I intend to do with the money is not an issue, is it? I suggest you start looking for that money quickly. Kyle doesn't seem to have much time. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
"
3,17,Stan,"What's Arkansas—is that a state?
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Now, Wendy, Kim might be uh, full-figured, but a woman's outward appearance isn't all that matters, nkay?! Have you stopped to consider that maybe, just maybe, you're jel?
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"It doesn't matter. He left me.
"
9,12,Stan,"I wrote that um, our followers shouldn't fly in DC-8s anymore because they're too much like Xenu's evil cruisers.
"
14,5,Kyle,"Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything.
"
2,3,Stan,"Goddammit!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Really?
"
16,8,Randy,"Yeah, no, you nice going! 
"
8,8,Stan,"Dude, I really don't care. 
"
6,6,Stan,"Okay, here he comes. 
"
12,10,Cartman,"How much?
"
3,5,Stan,"Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?
"
2,12,Kyle,"Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!
"
8,8,Cartman,"...Wait, wait, what about Butters?
"
5,10,Butters,"W-what?
"
12,8,Butters,"So wait. That's it? What about the Chinese invasion?
"
8,2,Cartman,"Well, guess I'll, guess I'll just have to kick ass in the other events.
"
2,16,Kyle,"Arrggh! 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Eup. 
"
13,12,Cartman,"Isn't this great, you guys? Gettin' away from it all, leaving all our cares behind?
"
2,15,Kyle,"Damn it!
"
7,12,Stan,"Dad!
"
8,4,Butters,"Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!  No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo!
"
9,5,Cartman,"What happens if we win the State Championship game?
"
12,12,Stan,"No, Dad, we gotta take Kyle's brother to the hospital.
"
1,5,Randy,"Huh?
"
7,2,Butters,"Hey Jimmy.
"
11,5,Stan,"Hey, what the hell!
"
13,9,Mr. Garrison,"Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess.
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh no!
"
3,5,Cartman,"I like it.
"
14,4,Kyle,"An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!
"
6,7,Cartman,"Woowww. Only three more hours, sea people.  Only three hours and you can take me away from this crappy goddamned planet full of hippies. 
"
5,13,Cartman,"Die? Kenny?
"
10,14,Stan,"Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?
"
6,13,Cartman,"Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!
"
12,4,Butters,"I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
I said what what? In the butt
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
You wanna do it in my butt, in my butt?
Let's do it in the butt. O-kay!
"
1,1,Kenny,"(Or look at the cat on her feet, then touch her.)
"
12,12,Kyle,"No, we don't want to enter any of your stupid shelter!
"
1,9,Kyle,"I don't have a problem.
"
1,6,Randy,"Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh, 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Yeah, I don't know what to do with it, though. Well, see ya.
"
11,4,Kyle,"Okay.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry!  Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.
"
13,9,Butters,"Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there.  He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges.
"
2,16,Cartman,"My family sucks ass!
"
4,11,Stan,"There's no way God will want to send us to hell now.
"
11,13,Kyle,"But it's our game. We bought it together.
"
8,10,Kyle,"Naw.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Ah, splendid. Then to Fort Sumter we shall go.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Wow! 
"
6,9,Kyle,"Why don't they leave those movies alone? We liked them the way they were!
"
6,16,Butters,"Uh well, sure thing, Stan. Eh, how come you care about schoolwork all of a sudden?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Oh, god-damnit!
"
2,5,Stan,"Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese? 
"
14,6,Cartman,"It's all that matters!
"
1,12,Kyle,"No way, fatty, it's mine!
"
8,14,Stan,"Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil.
"
3,8,Butters,"Hey, Stan. Why I-I-I sure am glad you're here, 'cause then we'll have even more fun than we, why, than we was havin' before. Why, we wuh, we were havin' an awfully good time before you showed up, too, however.
"
2,13,Cartman,"O-kay, I'll- get on the bull.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Fine. That's it. I give up. Have fun being miserable.
"
15,13,Cartman,"Yeah, God takes your period away, and apparently it makes you really irritable? I was thinking maybe that's why Kyle's been so grouchy lately, 'cause he's goin' through menopause.
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Anything?
"
5,7,Butters,"How the heck should I know?  Why, it's just a little doughnut.  Hoh- it's all gooey.
"
12,9,Jimmy,"I'll bet she is!
"
2,13,Kenny,"(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)
"
2,17,Stan,"Huh??
"
12,14,Butters,"O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!
"
11,10,Kyle,"...And then it got attacked by terrorists?
"
18,10,Kyle,"But now let me tweet this for you all to comment upon.
The more connected we get, the more alone we become.If you want change like I do, and feel the same gloom,Then please follow THIS trend, #savethelivingroom
"
16,14,Cartman,"Hmmm, no.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us.  Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted.
"
3,2,Cartman,"You guys, my mom is totally worried about me. You'd better let me down.
"
4,16,Cartman,"Well, you... could make them... go away for a while.
"
9,5,Cartman,"Come on, kid, you gotta at least swing at it.
"
3,16,Stan,"You're making that up!  Miss Aliton, what's it mean to get a period?
"
12,14,Butters,"I have no idea, sir.
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah! Get it! Get it all! Yeah, that's it! Burn, you bastard!
"
3,16,Cartman,"You guys! You guys!  Guess what?
"
15,9,Cartman,"All right men, rally up! There's still a Mexican out there and he ain't gettin' through!  You haven't won yet!  Game on!
"
6,5,Stan,"But all the other kids are gonna watch it and talk about it at school tomorrow.
"
5,13,Kyle,"You've never watched the news, fatass!  And what the hell does that have to do with anything?!
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles!! 
"
3,16,Cartman,"Yeah! Come on, we can set everything up in my clubhouse and get ready for New Year's Eve!  Hey, don't feel bad, Stan. Some of us just mature a little later than others. 
"
18,2,Cartman,"Hey dude. Sup? 
"
11,5,Stan,"If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
"
9,1,Stan,"Dude, don't be nervous.
"
13,14,Stan,"Okay Cartman, you can stop singing now. 
"
2,10,Stan,"Dude, I think I just saw a rat!
"
5,2,Butters,"We can't tell you.
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper.
"
8,10,Kyle,"Why don't you just sneak in your mom's closet and get a picture when she's changing clothes?
"
9,4,Stan,"What?
"
15,8,Stan,"Kyle, you've gotta tell me the secret to Cartman Burger.
"
13,3,Stan,"Aargh! 
"
7,4,Cartman,"Ohhh awesome!!! 
"
15,4,Cartman,"Yeah dude!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Sit down Mom, we need to have a talk.
"
14,10,Stan,"Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... ""hoarding.""
"
4,12,Kyle,"Huh?
"
10,3,Kyle,"Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ!
"
9,13,Kyle,"I don't know, but at least from now on, every time we look at the moon, we can know that Willzy-x is up there, dancing with the other zypods in his castle.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
10,1,Stan,"Forever.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Well, so then, if the stem cells are placed nest to s Shakey's Pizza, they would become another Shakey's Pizza! And you'd have your own Shakey's Pizza where you didn't have to charge yourself to eat!
"
12,5,Cartman,"The answer to #27 is 5.
"
6,3,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
1,2,Cartman,"I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.
"
2,15,Stan,"So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
"
18,5,Kyle,"See, when you start invading people's privacy, eh thinking it's harmless to put up pictures of them they didn't want up - Kenny! - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody!
"
17,10,Wendy,"What?
"
5,5,Cartman,"Alright!
"
14,4,Kyle,"I think I'll add some more... pigs.  Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there.  There we go. Nice.  Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends.  Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! 
"
3,16,Stan,"Okay.
"
1,13,Cartman,"But my mom says you're the guy she was with.
"
6,14,Kyle,"People of all colors and creeds holding hands beneath a rainbow!
"
1,3,Stan,"Yeah, my Uncle Jimbo says we gotta get up there early. Right, Uncle Jimbo?
"
11,7,Randy,"I just gave you change!
"
9,8,Stan,"Okay, turn on the ignition,
"
3,13,Stan,"Oh my God, Fonics Monkey killed Kenny!
"
7,11,Butters,"You take away the biggest part of me.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don't go.  Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, I just had to find my say to you tan...
"
10,13,Cartman,"What? NO!  NOO!!  You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!
"
3,4,Stan,"Because we had to choose between this and home ec, and we didn't wanna be sissies?
"
9,14,Randy,"Yes, they're the ones that told me. I thought I could just quite drinking on my own, but... it's an illness, son. I have to admit that I'm powerless to this terrible disease. 
"
9,3,Stan,"No, I don't think you understand. We're here with Wing. That's right, the Wing. 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?
"
7,3,Kyle,"I know.
"
3,17,Kyle,"Huh?
"
5,8,Kyle,"That's it?
"
18,2,Randy,"I can't touch you or hug you, but... but I'm right with you. Do you understand?
"
11,13,Jimmy,"Oh my sweet J-Jesus!
"
6,13,Kyle,"Gentlemen, we are off! 
"
1,9,Kyle,"I'm not hearing that.
"
5,13,Stan,"Wait. What's going on here? 
"
3,14,Cartman,"Gentlemen, we can win this battle!  Sure, we could lose, and tonight we can go back to our families and say, ""We did it! We lost like we were supposed to! Aren't we proud?!"" Or, or we take that hill. We take that hill, and when we stand tall upon it, we hold our heads high, and we yell, ""Not this year! This year belongs to the Confederaseh!"" 
"
4,11,Cartman,"Devil be  gone-uh!
"
2,10,Kyle,"Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast.
"
10,10,Kyle,"Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor.  Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"It's always been my dream to go on a national TV show and talk about the c-c-craft of comedy.
"
8,1,Stan,"Bad.
"
11,10,Butters,"Hold on! Hold on a second!  Now, you really should think about this. I mean, uh, I I know you think attacking our imagination will get you somewhere, but will it really? If you destroy that wall, all the most evil parts of our imagination are gonna break loose, but... will it really make you terrorists feel better? Maybe it's time for us all to just... get along.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Hey, you know, I heard you were doing some thing down in Denver tomorrow night.
"
3,6,Cartman,"He talked about having oral sex with my ass.
"
11,8,Cartman,"I don't need the toy! I've found something better!  'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!
"
8,9,Stan,"Me. I'm asking the question.
"
7,1,Cartman,"No I don't remember that!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Whoa, how very very relevant.
"
6,12,Stan,"Kenny'd better have the ticket stub with him in there!
"
15,9,Butters,"Boy, I've really done it this time. I have one simple direction: ""Go that way."" How did I end up getting lost? My amigos were right: I am a lousy Meheecan. They're all living the good life while I'm, while I'm stuck out here in Meheeco. I am... The Last of the Meheecans.
"
2,2,Cartman,"What?
"
6,4,Cartman,"Yeah, if you don't eat meat at all, you become a pussy.
"
3,6,Cartman,"Sweet..!
"
11,8,Cartman,"No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad.  So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. 
"
11,1,Stan,"Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
"
2,16,Kyle,"I can't wait to see him!  He's gonna be so glad we came!
"
1,5,Kyle,"Come on, let's go!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you.
"
9,11,Cartman,"The bitch isn't ginger! She's just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!
"
4,6,Kyle,"Dude. Being mature is boring!
"
7,15,Cartman,"Look out!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Sir, sir!
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Yes.
"
16,5,Stan,"Everyone loved me sixteen hours ago.
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Huh. Huh??)  (That does it!) 
"
13,12,Kyle,"Oh, what the hell?! 
"
13,7,Butters,"Huh, who, you mean you?
"
3,2,Mr. Mackey,"Well, let me show you, just to be sure, m'kay?  Hmm, come on. Be good, now. 
"
14,4,Randy,"...Oh okay.  So I'm, m not your friend then?
"
12,2,Kyle,"All right. Butters, go get next to her.
"
14,4,Stan,"Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Where were you this morning at nine o'clock, Butters?!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Okay.  Kugheek! 
"
5,7,Stan,"No!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
5,8,Stan,"Alright, guys, focus. Looks like this is gonna be an underwater level.
"
2,12,Stan,"But I don't understand why we have to--
"
16,4,Butters,"Hey, Eric.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Okay ma, thanks! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"I care, sure, but I hope it doesn't mean you and me and Stan and Kenny can't hang out anymore.
"
11,8,Kyle,"Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?
"
5,11,Cartman,"Goddamnit, give me another chance!
"
6,2,Randy,"So then it's not really ours.
"
5,12,Cartman,"No! No, see, this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system! The only reason Token was able to do all that is because his family is rich!
"
5,6,Cartman,"I'M SO PISSED OFF! 
"
1,7,Cartman,"Eating Kenny's pudding.
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh, alright then.  Hey Wendy. Wendy!  Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?
"
8,6,Kyle,"I know, I know. Be cool.
"
18,10,Kyle,"I'll call the producers of the show. They'll help you find your dad.
"
3,13,Kyle,"Uuuh, okay.  Gah!
"
2,13,Cartman,"What? This is cool.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters, that's all drones are for. If we use it for a couple of minutes tonight, your dad will never know.
"
2,16,Kyle,"Jesus Christ, finally!
"
16,8,Butters,"And when they try an-and thank you for those balloons, you say ""Ah I don't need any thanks! I did it 'cause it was the right thing to do!"" And then you give them a smile!
"
1,10,Cartman,"Yich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two.  Eeyy!
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Yuh, you do? Okay, well I'm not actually on the phone with a... jelly school, Wendy, okay?
"
8,1,Cartman,"We're in this together, Craig! If Butters tells on us, we're gonna tell on you! That's the ninja code!
"
13,14,Butters,"What do you guys wanna do first? I hear they have a new inner tube slide.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Told ya!
"
11,12,Cartman,"Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split
"
5,2,Jimmy,"And how about that school counselor? ""Uh, dr-, drugs are b-bad.""  ""Uh. Drugs are bad, okay? Uh, drugs are, drugs are bad, okay? Okay?""  Wow, what a great audience. ""Mr. Hat. Be quiet, Mr. Hat. Mr.-""  ""Hello there, children. Mr. Hat. Hello- Mr. Hat""  ""I'm making Salisbury steak for lunch.""  ""Salisbury steak for lunch."" Eh. Uh. ""Goddamnit, Goddamnit!""  And of course, my very favorite, ""Timmy! Huh. Timmy! Uh liv-, I'm living a lie! I'm living a lie, Timmy!""  ""Ti- Timmy, I'm living a lie. Heh, heh. Ah Timmy."" Heh. Sometimes it's like, ""Please, Timmy, learn a new word,"" heh. ""Timmy! Tu-Timmy!"" 
"
6,2,Cartman,"Look you guys, Butters is asleep.
"
17,8,Cartman,"Why don't you mind your own business?!
"
13,11,Kenny,"(Yeah, totally!)
"
6,12,Cartman,"Heaven could be like the pixie faeries of Bubble Yum Forest. You only see them if you really believe in them.
"
13,14,Cartman,"So?! Guess how many white people are at the water park today? One hundred and forty three! There are actually more minorities here than us!
"
12,1,Cartman,"What?! Aw, no!
"
3,8,Butters,"Uhuh, you uh really oughta play, Stan. It's an awfully fun game. Ah I've never been to England, but uh I'll bet the people there are really nice.  Are people nice in England, Pip? I bet they are, huh?  They got those thick noses and all.
"
15,2,Kyle,"Dude, killing everyone isn't funny!
"
17,8,Stan,"I would rather game with Craig than spend one minute having to set up an XBox Live account! We will get our PlayStations tomorrow, and you buttholes will have nothing!
"
5,6,Cartman,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
2,3,Stan,"I dunno.
"
4,3,Stan,"Yeah.
"
6,1,Butters,"Woh, boy! Jared's comin' to town!
"
10,14,Stan,"My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-
"
17,2,Cartman,"Boooo!  Boo, Wendy! Boo, Wendy Testaburger, Boo!
"
6,15,Cartman,"Whoa, whoa, watch it lady.
"
15,14,Butters,"Well actually, Eric, it's you. 
"
8,8,Stan,"Oh, forget it! I'm not gonna be persuaded into voting and I'm and I'm not gonna be threatened into voting if I don't feel comfortable with it! I'm not gonna vote and you can all just live with it!
"
4,8,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, I think that's the best day.
"
5,6,Stan,"Dude! 
"
3,12,Kyle,"I don't really care, dude.
"
4,12,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, that's great, Mr. Garrison. You've finally come to terms with yourself!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Good, good.
"
12,7,Cartman,"That isn't necessary!
"
12,14,Butters,"Some legends say that if you destroy the vampires' lair, the vampires go back to being human again.
"
7,15,Cartman,"Oh Jesus Christ.
"
3,8,Randy,"No, I mean... Well, they say everybody has at some point, don't they?
"
8,9,Randy,"Can I help you? 
"
13,3,Kyle,"Listen, this is all you need to know: the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity. The economy is just an idea, made up by people, thousands of years ago. The economy is not real. And yet, it is real. Nowadays they'll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them.  I applied for this yesterday to prove a point. It is an American Express Platinum card.  It has no spending limit.  Do not be afraid! This is only plastic. It's just something made up by people. Truly meaningless until we put our faith in it. Faith is what makes an economy exist. Without faith, it is only plastic cards and paper money.
"
1,5,Kyle,"Genetic Engineering Ranch!  Sweet!
"
9,14,Stan,"No, my dad doesn't drink.
"
13,3,Kyle,"My fault?
"
4,6,Kenny,"(I don't know. But I've gotta think of something.) 
"
1,10,Kenny,"Quack-quack.
"
12,13,Stan,"Ah, shit.
"
2,4,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. This morning we're going to have a special lecture by your school counselor, Mr. Mackey. 
"
6,13,Randy,"That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
"
3,5,Kyle,"Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
"
12,1,Stan,"Not me! That's, uh, kinda what he thinks.
"
13,9,Butters,"...A pimp. Huh...
"
7,11,Kyle,"Nah. Dude, I c-I can't go to have a birthday party while Butters is missing.
"
13,4,Randy,"The question is, how do we send a message to other girls in the school so this doesn't happen again! 
"
8,8,Stan,"I just think this whole thing is stupid! 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"What's the matter?
"
6,16,Butters,"Wow, look at this, Stan.  ""Are you sick of your parents? Do you want revenge for something they've done to you? Call the Parental Revenge Center of Western America for a free con-sul-ta-tion. Results guaranteed.""
"
12,10,Stan,"You guys! You guys, check this out: I saw another Peruvian flute band outside my house last night.
"
16,8,Cartman,"That's because you're too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Come on, gang, it's up to us to save Christmas!
"
12,4,Butters,"Well, how do other people make money on the Internet?
"
3,13,Kyle,"Rebecca, in public school,  we select our... own mate.  In public school, men and women get together. Make each other happy.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Don't worry, I'll get you down!
"
2,10,Kyle,"You!
"
10,7,Butters,"Oh boy, Park Avenue! I'm rich! 
"
4,14,Kyle,"I didn't do anything to you. Timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it. What do you want me to say to him?
"
1,8,Cartman,"This is what you eat before you eat, to make you more hungry.  Welp, food is here, that's it for the appetizers. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"I am the AWESOM-O 4000. 
"
13,1,Cartman,"And knowing is half the battle.
"
18,2,Cartman,"I don't even know what that means.
"
12,12,Randy,"Yeah yeah, flip the... Flip the cop car! Flip the cop car! 
"
7,9,Stan,"Is this for real?? This is for real!
"
2,7,Kyle,"Don't worry. Everything's gonna work out. It always does.
"
16,7,Kyle,"Just tell us, Butters.
"
10,1,Randy,"Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Muh-Mom, I've only just heard. They're making Chinpokomon dolls, mom. You can collect them all. You can collect them all, Mother; quick, come on. Let's go to the toy store.
"
8,14,Stan,"Dude!
"
1,5,Kyle,"Stan, you can use family love as a weapon against Shelly.  The next time she's gonna kick your ass, just tell her, ""Shelly, you're my sister, and I love you.""
"
5,6,Kyle,"Huh?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"M-m-m.  Oh, well, thank you!  You know, it's funny: you kiss just like my dad.  Well, Ms. Crabtree, this certainly has been a great trip. Let's head home.
"
14,14,Randy,"Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche.  Where is it?! Where is it?!  Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?!  Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!
"
4,1,Butters,"Well, uh-I sure do hate to, uh, to see my gender tuh, lose to a bunch o' women!
"
11,12,Kyle,"Yeah, I guess.
"
7,2,Stan,"Uh, hoo. Guys, I think we'd better stay out of this one.
"
8,10,Stan,"Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. 
"
2,12,Stan,"Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.
"
9,6,Stan,"Well, anyway, we just wanna let you know. Talk to you tomorrow.
"
4,9,Stan,"She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
"
6,1,Randy,"Well don't you see what this means? It's been 22.3 years, so... AIDS is finally funny!
"
2,6,Kyle,"Are there any questions?  Yes, Mr. Garrison?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Ot- Nice to meet you, Cartman. Yuh you know, I saw that same jacket you're wearing at Bosco's for $29.95. How much was yours? Um, I juh- I was just wondering if Bosco's is a ripoff?
"
2,15,Stan,"Cartman!
"
13,7,Kyle,"Please. Please let him go.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Well well well well well well well well well Kyle! You came all this way to try and join my pirate club.
"
2,12,Stan,"How do we do it?
"
6,15,Stan,"I didn't. I just asked her if November meant anything. Her father could have died in November, or Thanksgiving could have been really special for them. But I go with the birthday and validate it now, as if I knew, by saying ""He wishes you a Happy Birthday.""
"
11,8,Cartman,"Then the game is on, Kyle.
"
6,13,Randy,"Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store.  I also rented... a porno.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Ah, nice. Come on, mateys! 
"
2,16,Stan,"So, how far is it to Nebraska?
"
11,10,Butters,"Uh what's the Barrier?
"
4,2,Kenny,"(No! Nono! No! Don't do this! Nononooo!) 
"
2,18,Stan,"Yeah! 
"
3,2,Stan,"The what?
"
15,6,Butters,"Oh well, sure, uh he's the bringer of destruction and evil!
"
3,3,Stan,"Oh man! There's tons of stuff on succubuses, but nothing on how to stop them.
"
12,12,Stan,"Dad Dad, we have a problem.
"
15,1,Butters,"""You agree that Apple may charge your credit card or Paypal account for any products purchased in the iTunes store.""
"
11,14,Butters,"Fellas! Fellas! It's- Ohmygod! You're not gonna believe this!
"
2,8,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?
"
18,7,Butters,"Okay.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Oho yes! I did it I did it!
"
2,14,Cartman,"Yeah. Stinky, stinky britches
"
18,8,Randy,"Now I don't wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"I had a dream last night that you were a real dick.
"
3,2,Stan,"Uh, well, Bible, Wrath of Khan, what's the difference?
"
3,16,Cartman,"Ew, doesn't that hurt?
"
4,12,Kyle,"He's right. We have to take a hard stance right now and establish that we're the dominant ones in this relationship! 
"
9,8,Stan,"Mom, Dad?  Theh, they're gonna go help those people, right?
"
4,7,Cartman,"Okay, mom.
"
5,13,Cartman,"So then, could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away? In other words, if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease, the stem cells could become new muscle tissue.
"
9,6,Cartman,"I found the woman you need to talk to for me. Look!  Doctor Lindsay, expert in the paranormal. She can tell us what to do!
"
2,17,Kyle,"We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Tijuana, Mexico!
"
16,12,Randy,"Do you think I'm crazy for buying Blockbuster?! I'll make you pay! Alluh! All!  I got a little somethin' for all of you!  Run! You'd better run!
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"But it's okay because I found a new teacher's assistant. Say hello to...  Mr. Slave. 
"
8,3,Stan,"No, no, no, no, we want our money back.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I haven't seen my father for 23 years.
"
5,8,Stan,"Can't believe we have to go to school!
"
6,9,Cartman,"You have a heart made of ice, Mr. Lucas, and so we're goin' tuh melt your icy heart... with a cool island song. Gentlemen? 
"
8,8,Stan,"Aaaah!
"
4,15,Kenny,"(FIVE BUCKS???) 
"
7,6,Cartman,"Kenny, it doesn't go ""Pakew! Pakew!"", it goes ""BANG BANG BANG!!"" 
"
8,1,Cartman,"We're playing Ninjas, Butters.
"
15,1,Kyle,"Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
"
8,4,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
4,8,Cartman,"Ahh! 
"
3,2,Stan,"Hey, yeah! 
"
10,2,Kyle,"You do??
"
15,11,Randy,"What brah?! What brah?!
"
17,10,Wendy,"I won't do it, you guys! I'm sorry!
"
10,1,Kenny,"(Chef!)
"
2,10,Cartman,"But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!
"
9,8,Stan,"Dad, we're, we're trapped in Beaverton, We're, we were trying to save everyone!
"
8,3,Stan,"Yeah?! You wanna bring it, you little pussy?!
"
6,15,Stan,"Hey uh, I need to ask you a big favor. You, you did a reading on my best friend and uh, well you kind of messed him up.
"
18,1,Kyle,"No, I just can't get it to load.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Like what?
"
16,8,Butters,"Uh-uh oh, no E-eric, you're, why you're a great player.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Excuse meh.
"
7,7,Randy,"Just six quarters!
"
16,2,Stan,"Thanks. 
"
11,5,Stan,"My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.
"
12,8,Stan,"Look, what happened, happened. We can't change it now. We have to move on.
"
14,2,Butters,"Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh.  Kill Ronald Reagan.  Kill Ronald Reagan.
"
4,12,Stan,"Timmy, you have to stop!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Chef, what did you do when white people stole your culture?
"
17,8,Cartman,"Seems a little convenient, doesn't it?  Stan with somebody on the inside to help him get his PS4s. Who's playing dirty now? Let's face it, Sir Kyle, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
"
16,11,Butters,"Well, we're here, now what do I do? 
"
8,1,Butters,"Uh. Wuff, wu-wuff.
"
10,6,Kyle,"Maybe we should go for it.
"
3,5,Cartman,"I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.
"
16,14,Cartman,"I don't think so, General Tso! This way, officers! 
"
8,13,Cartman,"Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?!
"
2,15,Stan,"Where?
"
16,9,Kyle,"You found a network to buy it?
"
1,7,Wendy,"Eww.
"
4,11,Cartman,"And God is telling me that you have... bad eyesight. Is that it?
"
7,7,Stan,"Look, we- we've got nothing to lose.
"
17,9,Butters,"The graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old XBox.
"
2,18,Cartman,"For what?
"
7,12,Stan,"All right, I'm gonna go kick his ass. 
"
2,7,Cartman,"Deah, eh eh.  Oh man, what a weird dream!
"
13,4,Butters,"Oh God, oh my God no! 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother.  Fat Jew! Jew bitch!
"
14,8,Kyle,"Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!
"
6,11,Stan,"Huh?
"
2,5,Kyle,"Go for it, Pip. 
"
8,5,Butters,"AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?
"
13,3,Stan,"I wanna return this Margaritaville.
"
6,5,Stan,"Oh God-dammit!
"
2,9,Cartman,"Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Dude, that's not cool.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Ike! Go home!
"
2,8,Stan,"Come on, Cartman, get on.
"
2,13,Stan,"Kenny, where the hell is Cartman?!
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"That's right.
"
12,10,Randy,"HAAA! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Christ's sake..!
"
13,10,Kyle,"Wait a minute. Who is that?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Wait a minute! You guys, this is very important: when I bring Token back to the office, have Kenny hide in another room, and call the phone on my desk.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Mom? Mommy? Where's my mommy?
"
5,7,Cartman,"Watch this. It's sooo funny.  Come 'ere, dog, come on.  Good dog.  Red rocket red rocket.  Red rocket. Red rocket.  Come on. 
"
18,7,Butters,"I touched Wendy's boobs. 
"
5,1,Randy,"Oh, sure, I mean, you know, Cop Drama is a very artsy, dramatic show.
"
8,11,Kyle,"How about we revamp the name? Super School News sounds dry.
"
4,13,Stan,"Huh, that's a bitch.
"
10,8,Randy,"Yes?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning. 
"
18,7,Butters,"No no, you don't understand. This time I've been grounded for no good reason! I didn't do anything, Kyle!
"
5,3,Stan,"Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home.
"
6,5,Cartman,"It was just... I just... Butters, you asshole!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Maaaa. Mah mah mh.  Hmmm, 1776. When our Founding Fathers created America. I wonder what it used to be like in those days?  In those days? In those days? In those days?
"
4,10,Cartman,"Okay, because, last year, I took a sandwich that the priest of this church had been eating.
"
13,12,Stan,"We can fix this!
"
4,1,Stan,"Okay, go ahead and start.
"
5,2,Stan,"What do we want?
"
11,13,Stan,"Don't put this all on me, Kyle!
"
11,5,Stan,"Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
"
16,13,Stan,"...Farmers in where?
"
7,1,Stan,"Chef! End of the road! 
"
14,10,Stan,"Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-
"
8,3,Cartman,"Nice.
"
18,9,Randy,"Thanks for seeing me. I've got my speech written. I'm ready to let the world know the truth. 
"
6,14,Cartman,"I'll take three lunches today, please.
"
11,12,Kyle,"What am I supposed to do?
"
13,3,Kyle,"Not because of the Jews, Butters! Who told you that?
"
11,11,Stan,"Dude, we don't remember.
"
3,14,Stan,"Oh, boy. This is worse than I thought.
"
1,10,Kyle,"Ohh, dude!
"
9,13,Kyle,"Twenty... million?  Are you nuts? We don't have that kind of money.
"
1,4,Stan,"And it's okay to be gay! 
"
7,3,Stan,"Cartman's right, Kyle. We're all in this together.
"
2,3,Stan,"""If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft"".
"
6,13,Kyle,"Finally.  It's over.
"
11,2,Cartman,"HA!  For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer.  This first picture I like to call ""Moods of Winter"" , a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!
"
14,14,Cartman,"What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!
"
18,2,Randy,"Ng-oh. 
"
6,16,Randy,"Well, there's only one person I can blame. Motivation Corp.!
"
15,13,Kyle,"Errh!
"
17,6,Butters,"Hohoh! What'd you do, Kyle?
"
1,4,Stan,"He just needs some training, that's all. Sit Sparky.  Good boy, now shake.  Goood boy. Now, don't be gay.  Don't be gay Spark. Don't be gay. 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Hokay, but if you want my help you have to give it just a little kiss.  Kiss it.
"
15,8,Kyle,"Stan? 
"
11,14,Kyle,"All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!
"
7,9,Butters,"Uhm, oh. 
"
7,5,Kyle,"Cartman, will you stop this gayness?!
"
10,12,Butters,"Okay. 
"
11,12,Stan,"Dude! How did you do that, Butters?
"
4,2,Stan,"Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?!
"
14,9,Stan,"I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling ""Muff cabbage,"" what's muff cabbage?
"
18,5,Kyle,"Not if somebody took pictures without her knowing.
"
7,3,Kyle,"What have we done? 
"
11,13,Kyle,"Do we? He's a legend!
"
6,10,Stan,"No!
"
3,3,Kenny,"(Wait...) 
"
1,10,Cartman,"You guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?
"
5,9,Kyle,"Is this the right house?
"
2,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey!  Mr. Hankey?!  Mr. Hankey?
"
9,12,Stan,"I can't spend any money. I'm saving up for that bike I want.
"
11,7,Cartman,"No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something.
"
3,15,Cartman,"...play stupid games.
"
4,1,Cartman,"I'd love to eat a cake, you guys, but they don't let us take anything back to the cells from here
"
10,7,Cartman,"You can't do that to me, I-
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"How dare you! Come on, Mr. Twig. 
"
1,13,Cartman,"Oh my God! I'm a black African American!
"
11,6,Stan,"Again?
"
2,16,Cartman,"Bad Jimmy!
"
6,10,Wendy,"I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing? 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Wow, that's so cool. And so then Passover lasts seven days?
"
12,2,Stan,"I told you that would work!
"
13,10,Stan,"Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
"
3,16,Stan,"No, there's no blood coming out of my ass.
"
11,7,Kyle,"You son of a bitch.  You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! 
"
4,10,Cartman,"And he never took Communion!
"
3,2,Randy,"Wow. 
"
9,14,Randy,"But I put my faith in a higher power and... I haven't had a drink for five days now! 
"
4,10,Stan,"But crackers are his- body.
"
6,3,Cartman,"What-evah! I ran for Congress and won. Then I had sex with an intern, killed her, and hid her body! What-evah, I'll do what I waunt!
"
7,3,Kyle,"You TP'ed a house last week, Cartman?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Okay. ""Woo"" mouths again?
"
10,12,Cartman,"Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me.
"
17,2,Randy,"Felt great?
"
2,11,Cartman,"It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is.
"
2,12,Stan,"I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow! 
"
5,3,Stan,"Yeah!
"
12,8,Stan,"Jimmy? I don't know what to do about Kyle.  You know, I... I don't think he's ever going to be the same.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yes, I did!
"
2,14,Stan,"Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
"
9,2,Cartman,"Yeah. You know, I had a guy in Jackson County. He had a little drum circle in his backyard. It turned into a drum circle four miles in diameter. You get a few hippies playing drums and next thing you know, you got yourself a colony.
"
10,8,Cartman,"The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards.
"
1,3,Stan,"Yeah,  it's stupid. Let's go watch cartoons.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Haven't you seen the Haibo doll? It's like a pet, a robot pet. You have to feed it and pet it or else it dies, and it's the coolest thing ever! Santa has to bring me one!
"
1,9,Kyle,"Shut up, Cartman!
"
14,5,Butters,"Hey Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise?
"
16,5,Kyle,"He doesn't wanna do it, dude.
"
9,12,Kyle,"Hey Stan, we're gonna go to the movies.
"
3,17,Kyle,"Nuh-uh!
"
14,2,Randy,"Ohkay boys, you already told the truth.
"
11,7,Kyle,"What about you?
"
10,10,Cartman,"No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Dude, no wonder terrorists come from places like this! If I grew up here, I'd be pissed off, too!
"
10,1,Cartman,"Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?
"
11,2,Cartman,"What?
"
12,7,Butters,"We're gonna get it now!
"
6,3,Butters,"Uh well, yeah. You've all done it more than once?
"
10,2,Cartman,"Oh my CHRIST!  Kyle? Kyle!
"
4,9,Stan,"Hey, Cartman, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, anyways?
"
5,13,Kyle,"Oh, and what do you know about stem cells?!
"
5,3,Cartman,"Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?
"
1,4,Stan,"I got cut off for Marty's stupid Movie Reviews.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Garrison is taking us all on a field trip today. He wants to do the final egg check in front of the Governor's office!
"
16,12,Cartman,"You guys, we've gotta stop it!
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Attention South Park Students: will the following students report to the Principal's office immediately? Eric Cartman? Thank you.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Eh, it's not an act, Kyle! All I wanted was for these people to understand what Christmas means.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Grandmagrandmagrandmagrandma! 
"
14,4,Kyle,"Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Okay fine, let him speak!  Then we kill every non-ginger here!  You... you what? 
"
1,13,Stan,"Dude. We lost.
"
13,8,Kenny,"(Yeah.) 
"
3,5,Kyle,"You just squat, stupid! 
"
6,4,Stan,"Just do it really fast, and we can go.
"
1,1,Cartman,"If anybody calls or comes over, I'm not here, okay?
"
1,9,Kyle,"You mean you can see him?  Ah-I'm not crazy? 
"
15,4,Randy,"Rrrr!
"
7,4,Kyle,"I hate this town. I-I really really do.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Aaah!!!
"
3,7,Cartman,"You just want me to open the door!
"
14,9,Stan,"Try to find a way past it!
"
11,6,Cartman,"No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
"
13,10,Stan,"This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! 
"
14,2,Kenny,"(It's fucking disgusting!)
"
2,10,Cartman,"Oh, good. I'm starving.
"
4,10,Stan,"He's doomed.
"
8,9,Kyle,"I knew you were!
"
2,8,Kyle,"Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks.
"
2,18,Kyle,"I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
"
8,8,Kyle,"Wait. You guys, I have an awesome idea! We should secretly go around and tell all the students we can, to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet, and instead write in ""Giant Douche.""
"
4,10,Stan,"What if we haven't really done anything that horribly bad in our lives.
"
11,1,Randy,"Y-Yes, absolutely.
"
18,7,Butters,"Eric, you said you were going to get me out of this virtual world!
"
1,11,Stan,"Hey, man. If she only likes other lesbians, then all we gotta do is become lesbians, too!
"
10,10,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
7,14,Stan,"Well I don't drink coffee.
"
18,9,Cartman,"Oh, looks like Kyle is commenting on my commenter window, bras! Be sure to comment on that. #kyleisgettingfrustrated
"
14,2,Randy,"NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Really? That's cool. When did-  What did you say?  Trent Boyett?! Meanest, dirtiest, toughest kid in the world, super-pissed off at us, Trent Boyett?!
"
13,7,Cartman,"I am Captain Cartman and this here be my terrible crew! We be lookin' for a ship to pirate with
"
16,13,Cartman,"Dude, I don't give a crap about using recycled plastic!
"
5,5,Stan,"Enough! I know!
"
17,6,Kyle,"Okay okay... I love having Cartman's farts in my tummy. I love it.  I love it sooo sooo much.
"
1,12,Stan,"Quickly, Robert Smith! She's powerless!
"
9,13,Kyle,"Who said that?
"
3,6,Stan,"Whoa! Who are you?
"
2,2,Cartman,"Wake up, you son of a bitch!
"
4,11,Kyle,"Serves you right, Cartman!
"
6,6,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, you're a stupid Jew!
"
9,8,Randy,"You can't go out there! You'll freeze to death!
"
1,8,Cartman,"I'm not bringin' in food for poor people, Screw them!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Wow, a dragon right on the blade. Mom, can I get a Sumatomi sword used by the ancient Tokugawa soldiers??
"
3,5,Kyle,"Dude! I've never seen Cartman care so much about something.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Ohoooh, that's one to nothing, amigo!
"
3,14,Butters,"Uh, conuh-  Confederate Messenger Butters reporting, sir. I have a message for you from the battlefield. 
"
2,6,Cartman,"Blululululululuh. I am the deadly Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. I am very scary... And dangerous!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Well, I don't know...  and I'll bet Cartman doesn't know either!
"
3,6,Cartman,"Hooray!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
"
3,12,Cartman,"—Christmastime is presents for me.
"
2,16,Stan,"What?!
"
6,11,Cartman,"Gah, what the hell do his parents do to him?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste- ah!
"
2,14,Cartman,"Shut your goddamn mouth.  We have Nilla Crunchies, Berry Bars--
"
18,9,Randy,"I love Candy Crush.
"
5,8,Kyle,"That's it!  You're not getting high again until we have our Okama GameSphere back!
"
1,7,Kyle,"Oh my God! I killed Kenny! You bastard!
"
9,3,Stan,"We won't! 
"
7,5,Cartman,"Look, we spent all night at the recording studio. Now it's time to sleep!
"
12,13,Stan,"Basketball?
"
11,10,Butters,"Uh, excuse me? Uh Mr. Terrorist, sir?  Uh, I'm actually not imaginary, a-and um, my p-my parents are gonna ground me if I don't get back-  Aaah!  Okay, sorry. Uh sorry.
"
5,5,Stan,"What if we can get Phillip to agree to get back together. Will you do the Earth Day show for us?
"
3,14,Cartman,"Oh! Well, you know what I say?!  Screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
16,5,Stan,"I know, right?! 
"
5,7,Stan,"All this time... It's the girls that give us diseases!
"
9,11,Kyle,"But it's... it's not true they... have no souls. 
"
18,7,Kenny,"(You guys! You guys, oh shit, come check this out!) 
"
6,12,Kyle,"Jesus Christ!
"
6,17,Cartman,"What?!
"
3,5,Kyle,"Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!
"
10,1,Stan,"Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little.
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings.
"
3,1,Stan,"What?!
"
6,10,Butters,"Wuuhh, it's really fun.You toss these little rocks at cars, and if the driver gets angry, you blame me.
"
12,11,Randy,"Oh no! Oho oho. 
"
15,2,Kyle,"Plase sir, they're gonna kill our friend!
"
6,4,Kyle,"You need to freeze some of your ass off.
"
16,12,Randy,"Hey, whoa, what are you doing?
"
12,3,Stan,"Nah, I think Kenny's out sick today.
"
3,1,Kyle,"Thanks!
"
4,3,Stan,"Mom! Dad! Can the quints stay with us? Please? Can they?
"
16,8,Butters,"Are we just gonna let North Park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us?  Bein' nice is about what's inside you! When your enemy is nice to you, you just be nice right back! And if they give you two balloons, well you give them three!
"
9,1,Kyle,"Yeah. That's right.
"
16,9,Stan,"Dude, you okay? 
"
6,13,Randy,"Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it.
"
11,14,Cartman,"So? I'm hotter than Kyle.  I'm better looking than Kyyyle!  Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!
"
10,2,Cartman,"Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!
"
4,4,Cartman,"That's right. I got a bad case of ADD. No homework for me.
"
12,11,Kyle,"So we've gotta find another way out of here.
"
7,14,Butters,"Huh? Oh anything you have to say to me  you can say in front of Lexus.
"
3,2,Stan,"Dad, where's our Bible?
"
9,2,Cartman,"Hold it right there, Kyle! 
"
14,9,Kyle,"No, I'm serious. What is that behind you?
"
11,13,Kyle,"I have been sick!
"
13,7,Butters,"Where's all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?
"
6,15,Stan,"See, Kyle? I just started with something really vague. I chose an older man because I'm betting that, based on this woman's age, her father is most likely dead. But if her father wasn't dead, I could still say it was some other older man.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Why do you have a video camera?
"
12,5,Cartman,"You are the true dreamers. Tomorrow you will prove it. We will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water.
"
7,11,Kyle,"That's exactly what I wanted to hear from you all along. Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Oh heell now!  Mom! Dad's being mean to me! Mem! MEEM! 
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Oh you're trying! You call rolling your fat ass out on the stage and lazily blurting out your lines like a turtle takin' a shit, you call that tryin'?! This play is supposed to change  how people think, Kyle! Get it fucking right!  Pick it up from there!
"
14,7,Cartman,"I'm being serious, Kyle! Hello?!
"
13,12,Stan,"Yeah, and they said the weather's gonna be nice like this all day.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like ""No no, the fight hasn't started yet,"" and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair.
"
12,7,Stan,"Well howdy there, strangers.  Sorry to interrupt ye, but I done come from Pagosa Springs to buy me some wares an' sich..
"
2,12,Stan,"I guess, but-- 
"
10,11,Cartman,"What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times.
"
5,1,Stan,"What's that?
"
3,16,Stan,"He hates me more. He doesn't answer my prayers. I prayed to him every day and he never answered me.
"
8,11,Stan,"Good!
"
6,12,Cartman,"You're a- stupid Jew.
"
11,12,Stan,"Dude.
"
6,9,Kyle,"Don't listen to him! You still have a chance to preserve your film! 
"
4,10,Cartman,"So wwe won't go to hell as long as we eat crackers.
"
11,2,Butters,"Y-yeah!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Black people say Hey hey hey!  Uh oh, I think the white people are winning! White people got you beat, black people; you'd better represent! Let me hear you say ""I don't blame the white people. No no no!""
"
10,1,Cartman,"Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs. 
"
15,12,Stan,"Stop it, Cartman! It's true! We came to keep an eye out. Stephen Tamil said he had something big planned.
"
7,13,Mr. Garrison,"What'd he say?
"
4,16,Cartman,"You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police. You have to be like,  ""my parents molestered me.""
"
1,11,Wendy,"Laq hemblaq henlaq henlalah qemblaq!
"
5,6,Stan,"Jesus.
"
16,6,Cartman,"I'm so fucking bored! 
"
10,7,Cartman,"All right, I'm back.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Because that makes Butters gay now!
"
4,14,Kyle,"What?! Aw, dude, don't say that!
"
6,16,Stan,"I can't believe it! It's all a scam!
"
16,10,Randy,"Stan, you got something from Amazon.  Oh.  Ooohhh shit.
"
3,8,Stan,"Come on, we're gonna have to go tell 'em ourselves. 
"
16,10,Cartman,"Yes you should contact the fucking police! My mom is about to get fucking raped!
"
5,6,Stan,"""It's too late for that, Ms. Lopez."" 
"
18,8,Stan,"What's mean about it?
"
9,13,Kyle,"The whale's name is Willzy-x, and he told us he's dying on our planet. We've come up wth a plan, but we're gonna need all of your help to make it work.
"
6,1,Butters,"Ah! What did I do?! What did I do?!
"
16,14,Cartman,"MOOOMMM! MOOOMMM!
"
6,13,Randy,"A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths.  Uh, this is called ""69ing"" and it's normal.
"
3,15,Kyle,"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
12,11,Stan,"None of what that Homeland Security guy does make sense, so could you just fly us home, please?!
"
12,3,Kyle,"Kenny? 
"
18,10,Randy,"THEY'VE GOT STAN! JUST STAY HERE WITH MICHAEL JACKSON!  SHIT!! 
"
16,14,Cartman,"Butters.  You just couldn't keep your mouth shut, could you Butters?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Excuse us!
"
6,15,Stan,"Stop it! I didn't do anything!
"
1,10,Mr. Garrison,"Ooooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama. 
"
14,14,Randy,"Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay!  Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!
"
3,13,Cartman,"Come on, Fonics Monkey, drum!  Come on! 
"
11,14,Kyle,"I'm sure. Abe Lincoln was right: I don't wanna find out I'm good-looking and become a total shithead when I grow up.
"
17,3,Cartman,"You don't understand. There's no Denver left to go back to! 
"
16,3,Stan,"Come on, dude. Hurry.
"
9,8,Kyle,"We can't get out! The flames are too big!
"
9,9,Kyle,"Jesus, what are they doing in there?
"
10,10,Mr. Mackey,"You need to watch for bad behavior, and make sure anyone in the halls during class has a hall pass. M'kay? 
"
2,6,Kyle,"Look! 
"
10,9,Kyle,"Dude! What the hell is going on?!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.
"
18,1,Stan,"Dude, we're not gonna get any attention with that name.
"
8,11,Cartman,"Please, Mr. Meryl, but, the news is our life. Without it, we have nothing.
"
13,14,Cartman,"Just do it in English!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Uh huh, and so you want to join the fan club now. Our first meeting is at 5:30 p.m.
"
8,11,Kyle,"I could watch this for days. 
"
9,8,Stan,"Guys, come on! 
"
3,14,Randy,"Ey, that sounds fun. 
"
1,11,Wendy,"-and then we can dress up in little costumes and pretend we're getting married.
"
1,5,Kyle,"What should we do with him?
"
14,4,Wendy,"And you'd BETTER change your relationship status to ""In a relationship""!
"
15,8,Cartman,"The Zookeeper 2: Zookeepier! 
"
10,12,Butters,"No ma'am.
"
9,1,Mr. Garrison,"OH! Oh jeez.
"
14,2,Kyle,"Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!
"
12,13,Kyle,"You're not copying my homework, you lazy turd.
"
4,2,Cartman,"You guys! Oh my God, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! It's beyond rational thought, you guys!  Holy crap, you guys! I mean-
"
6,15,Kyle,"Grandma's watching me. Always watching me.
"
9,14,Randy,"We are the same, she and I.
"
7,3,Stan,"What about him?
"
16,10,Kyle,"You know God damned well what's going on! This ends right now! We are a family, and you need to go somewhere else!
"
10,6,Stan,"Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?
"
11,2,Butters,"Yes, it's all very confusing!
"
10,4,Kyle,"Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Sweeeeeett! 
"
1,7,Stan,"I, I can't.
"
1,13,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, hell yes!
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"A setup? But by who?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, wuh, welluh, Mr. Tweek, why don't we uh, go back to my place.
"
9,5,Randy,"Walk to first! Woo!
"
11,13,Cartman,"What?
"
4,11,Cartman,"No! This is a trick! Do not vex me, O temptress!
"
3,5,Kyle,"Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!
"
11,9,Randy,"I can't do it! I can't do it!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Sweet. You're so cool, Trapper Keeper. I would never let those assholes take you away. I don't wanna wait for my Trapper Keeper to be overThe ways of my Trap--
"
7,5,Cartman,"You have to get out of here! Jennifer Lopez is gonna kick my ass again!
"
3,6,Cartman,"I think Sexual Harassment Panda is cool.
"
15,11,Randy,"Agh! 
"
13,14,Kyle,"Jesus Christ!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Please, sir. I came because I don't think Ike belongs here. Family isn't about whose blood you have in you, family is about the people who cared about you and took care of you. We're not the same blood, but I love my little brother. We've taken care of him because he needed us to, and that makes us more family than anything. 
"
7,9,Kyle,"Aaaargh! 
"
6,2,Stan,"Yeah!
"
5,1,Cartman,"Wow, this is gonna be great! A whole new word!
"
3,3,Cartman,"Hi, Doctor Lout.
"
7,14,Jimmy,"She just- w-walked away, Stan. You're gonna have to face facts. It's over. 
"
12,9,Cartman,"Ahhh, sweet.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Don't, mother! Just, don't.
"
8,14,Kyle,"Huh?
"
18,8,Butters,"Oh no! Kenny!
"
1,7,Stan,"I don't know about this Chef.
"
11,9,Randy,"Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now.
"
15,4,Kyle,"Didn't you forget something?
"
3,16,Kyle,"Dude, did you get your period yet?
"
8,8,Stan,"I'm not voting! 
"
5,7,Stan,"Doesn't it give any other directions?
"
4,9,Kyle,"I'm not being in any  faggy boy band!
"
1,13,Cartman,"Why, thank you, Peter Panda. This is Distinctive Earl Grey.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I'm here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, I I needed the silver package? Okay okay? Can we do that?
"
8,6,Stan,"Mr. Jefferson, uh, it might be good for Blanket to learn how to chop wood.
"
12,13,Kenny,"(If you wanna get high and jack off, it's cool.)
"
7,10,Randy,"RUN! 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Who's they?
"
18,1,Stan,"No. Dad, we don't need school anymore. We're forming a startup company.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, perhaps you should sit down, Mr. Garrison, m'kay?  Mr. Garrison, I know this is very difficult, m'kay, but I must ask: is there a history of sexual abuse in your family?
"
4,2,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Woah, about the same.
"
13,4,Wendy,"What day?
"
13,10,Stan,"What?? 
"
13,6,Stan,"I guess so. It just still doesn't feel right.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Look, he knows full well what he's doing, and he's just waiting for us to buy into it, and then he'll laugh and point at our faces and say, ""Haha, I got you guys to believe me!"" ""You guys are stupid!""
"
13,11,Kyle,"What are we gonna do, Stan? It's, it's not like we can change the way an entire country thinks. I don't like it, but it's just the way they are.
"
5,10,Kyle,"Gay-ass. 
"
11,5,Stan,"Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?
"
3,14,Randy,"A whole year?
"
16,5,Stan,"Kyle? Dude, where are you going?!
"
10,3,Kyle,"Whoa whoa wait a minute!  This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?
"
12,7,Cartman,"Oh, I just don't know what I liked better: the historical buildings and archifacts or the, or the uhhhm.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh, gee whiz, I'm not.. uh watchin' television, Dad, I'm just... layin' around jackin' it.
"
10,8,Stan,"Dad, how did you get that?!
"
15,8,Cartman,"Well I'm glad you think Assburgers is funny! Just note my condition on your records there!
"
10,13,Cartman,"Right... 
"
11,9,Stan,"That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"There's another Klan rally tonight; I have to be there in 15 minutes.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Don't worry, everybody. I've spared no expense to make my comedy awards the biggest thing this school has ever seen. You're all gonna have a blast. 
"
18,9,Cartman,"Butters is such a butthole, oh my God! CartmaaanBrah!
"
12,12,Randy,"Not anymore we don't; everything's different now.
"
4,7,Kyle,"How much?
"
6,6,Cartman,"Clyde... ... okay. Now, the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten. And so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut. Please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped, so put on your best friend faces, and may the best friend win. Oh, and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee.
"
16,7,Cartman,"I never wanna see you again!  Take! Your sunshine! And frakin'! Die! 
"
14,6,Kyle,"Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.
"
16,13,Butters,"Yeeah. Is it true?
"
14,7,Stan,"A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Yeah. And my powerful nunchakus make me into Bunroku , a deadly but compassionate ninja who protects those in trouble.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Ugh! 
"
7,8,Stan,"It is not!
"
13,10,Butters,"Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
"
7,12,Cartman,"Hey Stan, how was your date last night with the new kid?
"
4,6,Butters,"Well uuh-uuh-alright then. 
"
15,10,Cartman,"Tchehe, right. That's why it's super funny to me.
"
11,6,Kyle,"Son of a bitch! 
"
12,3,Kyle,"Dude, I don't think we should be messing around with that crap anymore.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Oh, I like that. 
"
11,2,Cartman,"Uh! 
"
4,2,Stan,"You scram! We were here first!
"
1,1,Wendy,"Cool! 
"
15,8,Kyle,"Dude, we're gonna see the new Zoopeeker movie!
"
7,10,Randy,"At the same time.  Oh My God!
"
14,7,Timmy,"Timmy.
"
2,4,Kyle,"That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
"
7,7,Randy,"What do they want?
"
7,11,Jimmy,"Ing-mar ...Bergman.  Now you say, ""Ingmar Bergman who?"" 
"
4,1,Cartman,"What's the matter?
"
3,15,Stan,"to make it spin.
"
11,9,Randy,"Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap. 
"
18,8,Stan,"What do you mean? Is he a red mage or a green mage?
"
2,2,Cartman,"Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?
"
4,2,Stan,"Dude.
"
14,14,Stan,"Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
"
17,10,Jimmy,"Well, y-you gotta admit, Lisa Berger is pretty hot, Wendy.
"
4,2,Kyle,"You're wrong. If my dad says something is real, then it's real!
"
2,9,Mr. Garrison,"Good. See you in school. 
"
8,10,Kyle,"All right, all right!  Dude, what is the matter with you?
"
1,3,Kyle,"Yeah, make up your mind, dude!
"
4,16,Stan,"We're going tomorrow night! Cartman's got the bus schedule all figured out!
"
4,7,Cartman,"Oh, huh. Oh, geez, you know, when you're laughin' so hard that the milk comes out your nose? Uh ho ho, man!
"
3,16,Kyle,"What, fatass?!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Almost there, you guys.
"
13,5,Cartman,"So... here it is.
"
18,7,Cartman,"I'm happy that I totally got away with it.  What's a 911 area code? Hello?
"
5,5,Cartman,"Where the hell is Phillip?! Phil-lip!
"
1,7,Kyle,"It's working! They're turning back to normal.
"
13,3,Stan,"So?
"
7,13,Cartman,"Hahahahahaha!  Nice try, Kyle! Let's see you try to get through the door now! Haa haa hahahahaha!
"
18,2,Mr. Mackey,"I'm just sayin' that I personally feel sooo fuckin' amazing
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Sure, you can go off and screw any whore on Wyland Street, but when it came to your own son you were just too busy! 
"
16,14,Kyle,"Yeah, probably 'cause General Tso's chicken. 
"
11,5,Cartman,"And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!
"
6,6,Cartman,"All right, that does it! Pip, get the fudge out! Next! 
"
11,1,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, it might be best if you just ...let it go, m'kay?
"
3,4,Cartman,"Hey, maybe. 
"
9,8,Stan,"What?
"
4,6,Butters,"Huh?? Uh-uh well, huh, why me?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left.
"
3,14,Stan,"He'd better!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Where is the detonator?!
"
12,4,Stan,"It's not a big deal. We can just watch American comedy. 
"
8,5,Butters,"Yeah, and he's never gonna get me again! 'Cause what Cartman doesn't know is that I know one of his secrets!
"
13,14,Cartman,"The Mayans! They knew that minorities would take over the world by the year 2012! And now it's happening!
"
2,16,Kyle,"Hoh, boy. Here we go!
"
12,7,Butters,"No! If we don't leave right now, we're gonna miss the bus, and then they'll know we left!
"
16,5,Butters,"No it doesn't.
"
11,14,Kyle,"Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses.  Let's just... put those back on. 
"
6,13,Stan,"Ogh. 
"
18,3,Randy,"Yeah. Yeah I will. Yup. 
"
7,12,Randy,"One two three four. ""Pay one thousand dollars property tax.""  Isn't this great, you guys? Our first Family Home Evening.
"
7,6,Kyle,"We're not playing Dungeons and Dragons, assface!
"
6,16,Randy,"Well, you know what I think, Stan?
"
4,1,Cartman,"Yeah, neither do I. Friends suck.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Wait!  Walk out that door, Token, and you'll regret it the rest of your life! Christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million Americans! If each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be- 
"
10,3,Kyle,"Yeah! 
"
16,2,Stan,"YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!
"
4,1,Cartman,"But you said-
"
16,8,Cartman,"...I don't have a dad.
"
3,3,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
15,10,Kyle,"What's up?
"
5,8,Kyle,"Oh, this is so cool.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Well, believe it friends. The impossible has happened.  Kenny has a girlfriend.
"
16,5,Butters,"Stop it!
"
3,10,Wendy,"Dare ga pu shita no. 
"
8,10,Kyle,"We can't tell our parents, dude! We lied to everybody! Nobody knows we're responsible for Ms. Claridge's accident!
"
9,10,Stan,"...So take it with you!
"
2,18,Stan,"Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!
"
12,3,Butters,"Yeah, that's it little buddy. Just let it out.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Calm down, Kenny!
"
6,2,Stan,"Heather? 
"
8,6,Randy,"I heard people saying you all were from Illinois.
"
3,13,Kyle,"...I can't even get her to understand. It's like she's from another planet.
"
9,11,Kyle,"There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Here, Butters!
"
3,12,Stan,"Hey, Kenny.
"
8,6,Stan,"No, my parents are.
"
6,1,Cartman,"There it goes.
"
11,11,Butters,"Hold on, fellas!
"
5,1,Stan,"Wow! We can say ""shit"" in school now?!
"
6,5,Cartman,"You guys, Clyde said he taped it and kids can come over now to have a see.
"
13,5,Wendy,"And he's not fat at all.
"
1,1,Cartman,"You guys, get me down from here!  Ow! Help! Sons o' bitches! Dildos!
"
16,7,Cartman,"W-yeah, of course. 
"
9,12,Stan,"But you said that there were-
"
17,9,Kyle,"Red Robin can be rented out, for wedding parties. If we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Ookay, that's fine, that's fine. We can use IntelliLink to see what's available. Let's see, counseling request. Students. Make appointment.  Okay, ah whoops. Okay, uh sume, uh students make appoint-alala here we go. Make, make appointment.  Uhkay, here we go. Uhkay, what do you need counseling with?
"
10,12,Cartman,"Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!
"
7,11,Butters,"AAAAHH! 
"
12,13,Cartman,"This... is cool? This... is cool. We are really gettin' old, you guys. 
"
8,3,Stan,"Wait a minute. Cartman?! 
"
14,3,Cartman,"Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? 
"
1,11,Wendy,"Can I tell you something, Ms. Ellen?
"
9,6,Cartman,"She's got Colonel!
"
9,14,Randy,"Okay. 
"
1,1,Kyle,"Come on, Ike, we can make it just in time for dinner. 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Yeah, they haven't worked out the audio yet, but I-  He's so fucking stupid.  But I'm sure they will soon.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Jesus Christ!! The 99% is totally ganging up on me!
"
7,9,Cartman,"That's right. We already sold thirteen copies. You wanna pay me that ten-dollar bet, Kyle? Nyanyanyanya nya nya!  Hahahaha ha ha!
"
10,13,Kyle,"Hello? 
"
4,9,Kyle,"He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Okay, thahks, Tyler Perry.
"
17,2,Randy,"I love you too babe.  OH!
"
5,12,Stan,"I don't know. We don't have horses, so we can't play.
"
12,10,Randy,"What did that?!  What is that thing?! 
"
2,2,Kenny,"(Negative.)
"
2,7,Cartman,"You can do it, Fonzie.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Hey. Maybe it's our teacher, Mr. Garrison.
"
6,5,Kyle,"Do we have everything?
"
2,11,Cartman,"I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmh.
"
12,13,Stan,"Sweet.
"
8,3,Stan,"Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson.  But I think it's the principle of the thing that matters.
"
12,10,Cartman,"Cool, awesome. Um, Craig, remember how you were tellin' us how your grandma gave you a hundred bucks for your birthday?
"
4,9,Randy,"Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed.
"
12,14,Butters,"Really? Do you think that's best?
"
2,12,Stan,"Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Oh, well, sure. I've never really tried working with a partner, but let's give it a sho- a sh- a-sh, a-sh, shotaroosky. Let's see... I was workin' on this: Why does a squirrel swim on its back? To keep his -nuts dry.
"
18,8,Kyle,"You've never seen anything so ruthless!
"
12,3,Mr. Mackey,"Schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high, hm'kay, like sniffin' glue, guzzlin' cough medicine, huffin' paint, hm'kay? But they're all bad. M'kay?
"
16,12,Stan,"Trick or treat.
"
14,5,Stan,"What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, what is a moronic jizzrag?
"
5,14,Butters,"Yeah! 
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yep! Woo-hoo!) 
"
2,12,Randy,"No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare?
"
15,7,Kyle,"Alright guys, do you think he's lying or telling the truth?
"
2,12,Randy,"Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!
"
3,10,Kyle,"I'm not sure.
"
9,7,Cartman,"Sure, lots of times. I've been laid, like, five thousand times.
"
11,14,Stan,"NO.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Theh- They can't do that! I'm student body president!
"
14,14,Stan,"Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, stop it, stop it! Stop i-i-it!   Look kids, we're all in this kindergarten class together. We have to respect one another or else we're in for a terrible school year.
"
11,13,Kyle,"Who is this?
"
6,5,Cartman,"Shelly, did I ever tell you how hot I think you are?
"
1,3,Stan,"What? 
"
4,2,Cartman,"I am the tooth fairy, my child.
"
4,9,Randy,"Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?
"
8,1,Cartman,"Hold on you guys. I actually have another power. I can see into the future too, but better than Kyle. Let me try it.
"
8,9,Cartman,"Whoa, Pixie Sticks, twenty-nine ceeeents?  Wall-Mart? ...Are you speaking to me? ...My friends? ...Trying to hurt you again?  Yes, Wall-Mart. I understand. 
"
7,12,Stan,"I'm...  going over to his house for dinenr tonight.
"
2,5,Stan,"Yeah.
"
9,2,Cartman,"What's wrong is that there's more of you showing up every day and I need to find out why!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Oh, I mean, this is so cool!
"
3,2,Mr. Mackey,"I had a steak wrapped with bacon last night. 
"
14,14,Randy,"I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!
"
3,13,Cartman,"Huh, I can't. I'm too tired.  Maybe tomorrow.
"
15,9,Stan,"Ahhh, I think we'll stick with Kyle, dude. You made it across the border, but it did take you... two and a half weeks.
"
2,14,Cartman,"I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-la I hope my will enjoy my dance Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay
"
18,6,Butters,"We're playing the Terrance & Phillip Freemium Game.
"
10,2,Cartman,"No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!
"
14,9,Cartman,"This is very serious, Butters.
"
4,16,Cartman,"Heh, heheh.
"
14,9,Kyle,"Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
"
18,1,Kyle,"What?!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Nothing.
"
16,7,Mr. Garrison,"Everyone pay attention!  Now, what I really wanna get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess that's pretty hard to keep straight, isn't it? The Night's Watch- 
"
2,18,Stan,"You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!
"
7,14,Stan,"Yeah. Let's play ball.
"
11,13,Butters,"Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. 
"
15,14,Cartman,"Dude, my momma's so poor when she gets mad she can't afford to fly off the handle so she's gotta go Greyhound off the handle!
"
1,9,Wendy,"I believe in Mr. Hankey.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator.
"
14,9,Randy,"Don't let it get away! Where is it?!  Who was that?! 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Sooo, what's phase 2?
"
2,6,Cartman,"Totally.
"
11,10,Cartman,"All right, let's try over here.  Set up traps there, and there as well.  Last time I saw him he ran right through here. 
"
6,13,Kyle,"Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. 
"
8,5,Butters,"Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise! My mom is gonna be awful sore when she sees this mess! Now AWESOM-O, that is a bad robot! You can't do no chores for me unless I tell you to do them! You got it?!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Wow, thanks Mom.  You might have saved my life.
"
12,13,Cartman,"Oh God, shut up!
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention.  Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh... 
"
16,11,Butters,"Kenny!
"
7,14,Kyle,"Hey. Uh, this is Stan.
"
4,3,Kyle,"Let's go practice. 
"
7,5,Cartman,"Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez. From now on, we're staying away from Ben Affleck.
"
14,6,Cartman,"What do you know?!
"
6,14,Stan,"Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him.
"
3,7,Cartman,"I am not gonna be bossed around by a chick!  Maybe I'll just use my Wild Wild West techniques and get proof that Shelly had a boyfriend over.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Let's do this. 
"
5,5,Stan,"Dude! Did you get 'em?
"
7,15,Kyle,"I'm trying! 
"
16,5,Butters,"Well I didn't narc, Grandma. It wasn't me.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"But I've never taken drugs either.
"
12,2,Stan,"Oh no. 
"
13,4,Randy,"Boy oh boy. I think we might have screwed up royal, Stan. 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Come on guys. If we all help out, we can do it super-fast.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Ugh, okay Stan, what do you wanna do?
"
6,1,Butters,"Well, uh, how come? What's wrong with me?
"
6,4,Cartman,"I want out.
"
2,12,Stan,"No, you don't!  Dude!
"
10,9,Butters,"Hey, fellas!
"
4,4,Cartman,"No, dude, you gotta try it.  It makes you feel good.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners.  Wah! 
"
3,7,Cartman,"You can't hit me! Didn't you see those nanny videos on TV? 
"
11,1,Stan,"I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
"
5,6,Stan,"Come on, we gotta see what Cartman is doing with his money. 
"
5,1,Kyle,"What, doughboy?
"
6,13,Cartman,"Ha!! Fags! 
"
14,14,Randy,"Quiet on set, please.
"
1,11,Cartman,"Damn, man, someone's got to pull that monkey out of Wendy's ass. 
"
12,8,Cartman,"All right Butters, we're here.  Are you ready?
"
2,13,Stan,"We should- 
"
1,12,Stan,"Well, at least I have this sweet walkie-talkie Robert Smith gave me.
"
4,13,Stan,"Uh-oh.
"
16,10,Stan,"Whoa!
"
9,4,Cartman,"You say Kenny, but I say tomato! 
"
7,12,Stan,"Yeah.
"
7,3,Stan,"You don't have to kill Kyle, dude. The police made an arrest. And the person confessed!
"
2,10,Cartman,"We want you to give our parents herpes.
"
9,8,Randy,"No, Stan, I'm afraid us adults just let you children down. We didn't take care of our earth, and now you've inherited our problems.
"
11,13,Stan,"Are you serious??
"
9,14,Stan,"Wait. Where's my Dad?
"
4,2,Cartman,"What the-? 
"
3,12,Cartman,"Eewww, it feels like cold spaghetti! You guys, it feels like cold spaghetti!
"
4,9,Kyle,"Jesus Christ!
"
7,1,Stan,"It's the police!
"
15,14,Kenny,"(Hmmm. What the fuck?) 
"
3,4,Kyle,"Come on, Tweek! He's only got one arm!
"
1,2,Wendy,"I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer.
"
4,15,Stan,"I don't believe it.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Platinum album! Platinum album! Gotta make a platinum album before Kyle! 
"
18,1,Cartman,"Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.  Sure, we'd be happy to take your money. Yup. Go to our kickstarter page. Okay, nice, idiot. Uh huh, fuck you, bye bye.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Since when?!
"
5,10,Kenny,"(Aww, that's bullshit!)
"
16,9,Kyle,"Yeah! We've gotta raise people's awareness!
"
16,2,Stan,"Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of! 
"
1,1,Wendy,"Eww! 
"
7,13,Kyle,"No! What we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves. Even if it means getting grounded.
"
13,10,Kyle,"What?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Nooooooo!
"
18,2,Cartman,"Yeah! Well said, Kyle! Good point! What, what happened to the significance?
"
1,10,Cartman,"Hey, wait a minute. Saturday is my birthday party. They can't have the fight on Saturday!
"
12,1,Kyle,"There is no cure, you asshole!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Peter Pan, too??
"
2,5,Kenny,"(Sheesh!)
"
17,3,Cartman,"Nah! 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Anyway, that will give me plenty of time playing video games.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Can I ask you a question, Weasel?
"
14,9,Butters,"Are you being serious?
"
5,8,Kyle,"Aw, God-damnit!
"
16,7,Kyle,"What?!
"
15,2,Cartman,"Token, stop giving Tyler Perry money or he won't go away!
"
15,9,Cartman,"Oh no you don't! 
"
1,12,Cartman,"Eeyy!
"
5,3,Cartman,"Did you hear that, guys? We're finally gonna die!
"
7,4,Randy,"The boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest! 
"
5,10,Kyle,"Why'd you call us?
"
7,3,Mr. Mackey,"It's too late, boys, m'kay? We already know everything.
"
4,9,Cartman,"What's the Gomlich effect?
"
11,6,Stan,"You guys, school starts in ten minutes!
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Hat isn't real.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Sweet, whatever.  Bingo!
"
1,1,Stan,"Don't be such a fraidy cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can't take you on board again.
"
8,1,Butters,"But I... But I... But I can't see nothin'. I gotta go to the hospital! 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Dude, the Simpsons have done everything already. Who cares?
"
14,6,Cartman,"Protect who??
"
2,18,Stan,"My friend, Gorak!
"
12,10,Kyle,"No! No, I'm not going to Peru! Not Peru! 
"
3,9,Kyle,"Kyle Broflovski.
"
3,8,Butters,"Uh what is it? Is it something neat? Uh I wonder what it could be. 
"
5,3,Kyle,"Yeah. Why is that good news?
"
3,3,Stan,"We'd love them!
"
10,9,Mr. Mackey,"More important?! You aren't the one, who had to walk into the boys' bathroom, okay, after having tuh, to wake up early, you know, there's no, no coffee in the teachers' lounge, and then you, you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal! Like it's laughin' at you!
"
6,16,Stan,"So throw it away.
"
8,4,Stan,"What?
"
3,4,Stan,"Tweek?
"
3,10,Cartman,"...But Mo-o-om, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool.
"
4,12,Cartman,"You're damn right they do!
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh my lord, Kyle, did you just throw doodoo at Eric?
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Hat, on the other hand...
"
10,3,Stan,"Dad?  Dad, what the hell is going on?! 
"
13,4,Randy,"Hey, we're getting all the parents together and we're gonna take care of this, okay? Nothing like this will ever happen again.
"
4,9,Randy,"Come here, Stanley.  Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.
"
7,8,Kyle,"Stan? 
"
14,4,Stan,"What?
"
1,4,Kenny,"(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)
"
14,11,Cartman,"I need to speak with him, please.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Hold the gun on them Butters!
"
3,16,Cartman,"My period, you guys. You see, there comes a time in every child's life when they grow up and nature takes its course by having you bleed out your ass for a few days every month.
"
2,18,Stan,"What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!
"
11,14,Wendy,"If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we...  That we reopen last week's list for debate.
"
1,11,Wendy,"Well it is!
"
7,4,Cartman,"I'm trying to have a flashback.
"
1,7,Stan,"Yeah.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih. Timmih!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Yeah, but you know, I've learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They'd still be fat and, we'd be responsible for their shattered dreams.
"
3,4,Stan,"Huh?
"
2,11,Stan,"Dude, I told you something was up with this place! 
"
2,8,Stan,"How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?
"
1,9,Mr. Mackey,"Well of course he does; in your screwed-up little head he's the only friend you have. 
"
2,14,Stan,"Hello, are you Meat Loaf?
"
8,5,Butters,"Hey, robots don't fart!
"
7,5,Cartman,"I'm sure it was just a mistake.
"
12,14,Cartman,"Oh-hohhh, you got pwned, Bebe, you Jap bitch!
"
12,8,Butters,"I seriously didn't mean it.
"
1,3,Stan,"I can't. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Whattayou mean?
"
4,16,Kyle,"Hoh, geez. 
"
8,6,Randy,"....Yeeeah.
"
7,1,Kyle,"My God-damned little brother's trying to follow me to school, again!
"
13,14,Randy,"You can't just leave my son in there with all that pee!
"
13,3,Kyle,"Ju-just have a little compassion, huh? I mean, everyone's gone out and bought something stupid. It's not so bad. Whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous, go ahead and huck the next squirrel. 
"
17,6,Cartman,"Okay. I want the whole world to see how much you love my farts. Plane leaves tomorrow. 
"
15,7,Randy,"You don't get it, Sharon! You never have! And that's supposed to be my fault?!
"
4,17,Kyle,"You sit- 
"
9,3,Kyle,"How come we never get opportunities like that?
"
3,4,Cartman,"Give him sucky, Craig, give him sucky! Hurlong churshar!
"
8,1,Stan,"Good luck, Bulrog. 
"
15,9,Butters,"Base! 
"
12,2,Randy,"This is important, Stanley!  You boys should care about this stuff.
"
14,5,Cartman,"Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?
"
13,8,Kyle,"Your mom... uses Chipotlaway... to clean blood stains... out of your underwear?
"
7,7,Cartman,"Wait a minute! I've got it, you guys! We can get Kyle infected with AIDS! And then start a charity organization that we steal money from! Come on, let's go!  No? We can't give Kyle AIDS?
"
1,3,Randy,"Uh - pretty sure.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Dude, they have gone too far this time! There is no doubt the government is tracking me! We're gonna have to put off the rally.
"
13,10,Butters,"No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!
"
8,9,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I'll bet you five bucks that when you die you crap your pants, asshole!
"
6,2,Stan,"Dude, I have to!
"
6,5,Stan,"Hurry! The commercials will be on any minute!
"
6,16,Randy,"Yeah, Stan, why don't you go upstairs and play with yourself?
"
12,13,Stan,"Yeah. You don't know 'cause you're just a third grader, but, take it from me,  you're driving everyone crazy.
"
6,1,Butters,"Uh- perfect.
"
7,14,Cartman,"Right. What are we playing again?
"
3,5,Stan,"Dude, it's crowded in here.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Dude, we just need you to come down to City Wok real quick so they can see how skinny you are!
"
2,11,Kyle,"What do you mean?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Right?
"
6,2,Stan,"This isn't about you, Kyle, I have to do this, okay? I have to!
"
18,2,Stan,"Wendy, I thought my life was going in a different direction and I just felt that I, I really had to give it everything I had, you know. I had I had to focus on one thing.
"
10,6,Stan,"...Yes, I'm serial.
"
3,12,Cartman,"You mean, we make something that looks like a dead body?
"
9,3,Kyle,"Why?
"
5,3,Stan,"I knew it.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Hey you guys! You're not gonna believe this!  Oh my God, you guys, seriously!  Just wait until you hear this, you guys! I'm rich! I'm totally rich!  Aren't you stoked?!
"
9,6,Butters,"Oh.
"
1,8,Kyle,"Ass-raper.
"
18,1,Kyle,"No way!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Guys! Okay, look, maybe I'm ginger, but... I'm not like other ginger kids. I'm still me inside. 
"
11,1,Stan,"Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Did you make it to your job interview?
"
12,1,Cartman,"No! No, this is a joke, right!? This is a joke; I can't have AIDS!
"
5,7,Kyle,"No.
"
10,7,Cartman,"'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. 
"
16,1,Randy,"Yeah, I know, I had it on. I just took it off for a second to get the uh... to get to the uh...
"
1,2,Wendy,"What?
"
10,6,Cartman,"No, nothing  No, nothing here! Nothing this way!  Tr... treasure.
"
16,3,Kyle,"Cartman? Go, Cartman.
"
12,13,Stan,"Hey, kid, over here.  Hey, uh, listen. You know this whole singing and dancing thing you do? I think you need to uh, ease off a little bit.
"
14,8,Cartman,"You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. 
"
16,10,Randy,"Wouldn't be the only ones in your family completely in the dark.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Dad, Jesus C-Christ!
"
5,8,Stan,"Oh, dude, we finished level 50!
"
4,4,Kenny,"(Me too.)
"
5,9,Randy,"Oh okay. 
"
18,7,Stan,"In on what?  Ohh,  Fuck you!
"
15,11,Randy,"I don't know, but whatever it is, it's worth the ticket price, because couples that pay to see it are stronger, better, and much, much happier.
"
2,10,Stan,"Wait! Where are you going?
"
14,2,Cartman,"Butters, what are you up to?
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)
"
18,10,Kyle,"I am so confused.
"
9,11,Cartman,"And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn't born like this!
"
12,14,Butters,"Well okay, but Dad, you've gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They've been acting-
"
18,8,Jimmy,"Fantastic girls volleyball joke, Stan.
"
4,17,Stan,"Uhd- W, WW-e wish you a Merry Christmas
"
13,13,Wendy,"Try to understand this: all I do is try to help run student council. I don't give a crap about Smurfs!
"
3,10,Kyle,"What?? ""A-ight""'s not cool, either? When did that happen?
"
15,4,Randy,"Four point four inches...
"
13,9,Butters,"It's a kissing company.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Can't go on. Need... food...
"
16,1,Randy,"It is time for us all to grow up.
"
14,10,Stan,"Who's that?
"
10,10,Cartman,"Keep your mouth shut, brah!!
"
13,12,Kyle,"This... is exactly what I needed.
"
4,7,Cartman,"No no, no no, no!
No no, no no, no!
"
1,10,Cartman,"Who the hell decided the fight had to be on Saturday, huh?! This whole thing is a plot against me, isn't it?!
"
7,11,Kenny,"(Woo-hoo!)
"
3,3,Cartman,"God damn it!
"
15,7,Randy,"City bop! City yeah!  Thank you! Thank you so much! I'd like to uh, bring up a special guest now. The other night I was chatting in a Tween Wave chatroom, because I do love Tween Wave so much, and I uh started chattin' with this nice lady who also really like her kids' Tween Wave music and... turns out she's a real talented artist as well. Please welcome Miss Steamy Nicks.
"
10,6,Stan,"Kyle! No!
"
10,14,Stan,"Ah, it's okay. Don't cry.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Yes. They are safely concealed in the depths of my ass.
"
10,7,Cartman,"What is he still doing here?!
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, boys, can I have a quick this and that with you? Boys, I don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you'd better stick with it. 'Cause if these people find out you didn't really write that paper, and I actually do get fired, then Mr. Hat is gonna do horrible things to you.  Oh, not that, Mr. Hat! That's really horrible! Anyway, good luck passing your new law, boys.
"
1,13,Kyle,"We're gonna win $10,000! 
"
16,2,Stan,"Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself.
"
18,8,Kyle,"You mean there's more to this?
"
2,7,Kyle,"'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!
"
6,10,Cartman,"It puts the lotion back in the basket!
"
18,2,Randy,"Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. I am Lorde, yeah yeah yeah. Lorde, Lorde. Call me Lorde yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah.
"
4,12,Stan,"I know.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Let's just stay here and watch the whale swim around some more.
"
14,4,Randy,"Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?
"
7,6,Butters,"My weiner??
"
7,7,Mr. Mackey,"But, what do we do now? I mean, we can't just stand here and block their way forever.
"
7,7,Mr. Garrison,"Oh my God.
"
12,11,Cartman,"Yeah, it's coming from up there.
"
14,10,Stan,"Wait wait, where the hell are we now?
"
2,2,Cartman,"Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Ugh.
"
10,3,Stan,"Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses.
"
6,16,Randy,"Right. That's mother's intuition; you can't argue with that. No, Stan, I think the only way you're gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol.
"
7,1,Cartman,"What?
"
2,4,Kyle,"Come on, Ike, hurry up!  Where is the next train going?
"
10,3,Kyle,"Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea.
"
6,4,Cartman,"What do you have in mind?
"
12,14,Butters,"Whoa.
"
11,1,Randy,"Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?
"
11,2,Butters,"Well yeah!
"
2,13,Kyle,"He's up in, like, twenty minutes!
"
10,14,Randy,"Take the shot!! Take the shot!!  NOOOOOOOOOOO!
"
16,7,Cartman,"You're my ray of sunshine, Cupid Me. 
"
1,7,Cartman,"Nobody screws up my trick-or-treats and gets away with it!  Aaah, kew!
"
14,8,Butters,"NASCA- NASCAR?
"
1,6,Stan,"Aaah!! 
"
5,6,Stan,"AGGH!  This isn't over, Cartman!
"
7,13,Stan,"What are you doing, Cartman?
"
4,13,Stan,"Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?
"
7,7,Stan,"What???
"
9,6,Butters,"This is going to seem very strange and, and you may not believe me, but, well, your son wanted me to tell you something.
"
7,14,Stan,"Over?  Jesus...
"
6,13,Cartman,"Yeah, stupid.  Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's body is big enough for the both of us.  Shut up, Kenny.
"
15,13,Kyle,"Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.
"
14,10,Stan,"Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-
"
12,9,Mr. Mackey,"Welcome to detention, m'kay? You are here until your parents come and pick you up. Use your time to study. 
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh boy, I sure am nervous.
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Why?)
"
16,4,Cartman,"Well that doesn't seem very fair, Kyle. I mean, if God is going to make Pharaoh say no, then why would he punish him for saying no?
"
5,12,Randy,"Hey, uh, Sharon? Isn't that the Williamses?
"
3,17,Kyle,"Ungh, I can't find the word ""queef"" anywhere! 
"
10,7,Cartman,"Goddammit!  Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets.
"
4,15,Stan,"What's a prostitute?
"
2,16,Cartman,"How much further is it to Grandma's house? I wanna see what kind of present she got me.
"
7,9,Butters,"Huh we're not really Christians, we're just pretendin' we are. 
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Hey fellas.
"
7,9,Stan,"Beside, maybe our sound would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. 
"
11,2,Butters,"Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle.
"
13,14,Butters,"Please, Kyle, I wanna go home.
"
18,10,Cartman,"Why does that matter?
"
1,5,Cartman,"Kyle no, seriously.  No fuckin' elephant is going to make love to my Fluffy, I…Kyle, I will kick you in the nnnnuts.
"
11,8,Butters,"Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'.
"
17,7,Jimmy,"M ma um m-me too.
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say?
"
11,7,Randy,"Find another place to hide, Steve!
"
1,9,Cartman,"Good-bye Mr. Hankey!  Bring me lots of presents!  I always believed in you!
"
1,1,Stan,"Killer! Thanks, Chef.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Thanks.) 
"
2,15,Stan,"That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Game on, Jew-boy!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
"
10,4,Kyle,"Ow. Quit it!
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, and so uh,  so who can tell me the answer to the first problem, six times eight? Uh, Bebe?
"
5,10,Stan,"Why are you wearing a paper bag on your head?
"
2,7,Stan,"Hey! We've landed in ice cream!
"
4,7,Mr. Mackey,"Yes.
"
2,14,Cartman,"Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!
"
6,13,Kyle,"Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!
"
9,6,Butters,"Me! I saw a ghost!
"
7,3,Cartman,"You can't do that!
"
10,9,Kyle,"You f-figured this thing all out?
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"What the...?  Whoa-hey-way-wait-aaah.  Aaaah. Mr. Hat! Save yourself! 
"
6,1,Stan,"Marry him?
"
7,13,Cartman,"Heh, okay, okay.  You know, some people say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. The tobacco companies say there's no proof that second-hand smoke kills. I've just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. I guess... I'm the proof. The next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesn't kill, think about me. Because, by the time you see this commercial, I'll be... dead.  Dead??
"
15,5,Cartman,"We are turning this thing into a legitimate sport, Kyle. We're getting Slash to start playing at halftime. And EA Sports is offering us a hundred thousand for the video game rights.
"
9,2,Stan,"You mean like a baker and a cop?
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
7,8,Stan,"Dad, Craig is trying to say that his dad can out dress you!
"
14,14,Randy,"Ogh, yeah. Man, that ogh... 
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh, is this the Stotch residence?
"
18,2,Stan,"I... we... we wanted to bring people together and help Scott Malkinson, but-
"
5,11,Cartman,"No, I'm seriously! Because, um, I was, I was talkin' to Craig, and Craig was all like, ""Hey, did you know that in World War II they really HAD concentration camps?"" And I was all like, ""No way!"" And this little light went on in my head like, ""Aw man, no wonder Kyle thought what I said in the class, seemed like it was directed at his cousin."" But, but I was literally talkin' about a concentration camp, you know, where you go for a week to learn and focus, you know. Oh, mahan.  What a misunderstanding, huh? 
"
4,2,Cartman,"I ain't giving you crap! Kenny's not afraid of you! 
"
4,12,Cartman,"Hahaa! Charade you are, teacher! I'm afraid we have different plans! Gentlemen? 
"
3,17,Cartman,"That they should bring back Chicago Hope for another season? Totally.
"
10,4,Kyle,"Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Wha? Why did you pan to me just now? What the hell is that s'posed to mean?
"
6,3,Kyle,"This is gonna be awesome!
"
5,1,Stan,"What?!
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Boy I'll tell you something Mr. Hat. Being hot and sexy is fun for a while, but it sure does get boring.
"
3,2,Randy,"...Uuuh. Mayor, I'm a geologist.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Hormones?
"
15,11,Randy,"It's time to put an end to Broadway once and for all! 
"
3,2,Randy,"I know you all hate me, but please, for your own sake, fart in moderation. You can keep stoning me now, if you want.  Ow.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Yes?
"
5,6,Cartman,"Get him out of here! 
"
2,3,Cartman,"Sir, step out of the car, please.
"
4,13,Kyle,"Cartman?  He's not gonna open it. Break it down.
"
5,7,Butters,"Ow! Huhuh, ow! Okay, eh.  Ow! There. Okay, I think it's on.
"
3,13,Kyle,"Boy, that kid's having a hard time adjusting to public school.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Hey dudes.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Let him out, Cartman! 
"
6,4,Butters,"Hear hear.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"We don't have any African-Americans in our class!
"
12,4,Kyle,"Excuse me.  Hello?
"
9,12,Stan,"But I don't know any of this stuff.
"
13,7,Butters,"He's right, lads. To adventure!
"
17,8,Butters,"We don't like it! And I'm pretty pissed off, if you wanna know the truth!
"
6,3,Cartman,"...my, my mom?
"
2,8,Kyle,"What a baby.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Oh GODDAMMIT I HATE CHECK-MINUS!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Oh boy! It's my best pal, Eric!
"
8,9,Kyle,"That is fucking stupid, Cartman!
"
2,12,Stan,"But no! I have to get the girls to come-
"
3,5,Cartman,"Moving?
"
1,6,Stan,"Hey look!
"
10,4,Kyle,"You are NOT KILLING FAMILY GUY!!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Okay, alright, so listen: I know our family is poor, okay?! But before we lived there, Kenny was actually poorer than me! So technically, he's the poorest kid at this school!
"
9,9,Cartman,"No, No! We don't have time for that, Stan. It's time to ask questions.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Will you stop saying that word?!
"
1,11,Wendy,"Yeah. What I'd really like to do is load her into a rocket and have her shoot into the center of the sun. But instead, I'll just get Stan to notice me again. Bebe, I need a makeover.
"
17,6,Kyle,"I... because the world is at peace. I must endure.
"
13,14,Cartman,"It wasn't? So then, you mean... we do have until 2012. Well, it may be only three years, but... I intend to live those precious years to the fullest!
"
4,14,Timmy,"T-Timmih? 
"
6,1,Stan,"Chef, we need more food.
"
1,1,Cartman,"No, it was just a dream, my mom said so.
"
5,13,Stan,"Tell him we're busy.
"
16,3,Kyle,"You guys are sellouts.
"
18,1,Kyle,"Because that sounds like we don't have anything, We've been through this already, Stan!
"
6,8,Kyle,"You're on, fat boy!
"
5,2,Stan,"Wow, I never knew Jimmy was gay.
"
7,14,Butters,"Dad, I need an advance on my allowance again.
"
4,1,Stan,"We did it!
"
9,14,Stan,"Why not just pull over?
"
10,10,Kyle,"How do you know that?
"
1,1,Kyle,"Well, it looks like she's not going to show up, Stan. Let's go look for the visitors now.
"
1,4,Stan,"Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your-  Sparky, get down!
"
12,11,Randy,"Here we see a view from outside the bus.
"
1,2,Cartman,"Screw you, hippie!
"
6,6,Butters,"Well uh, it's my pleasure! I love bein' you guys' new friend.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Oh, dude, that is tits! I mean, that is big fat Oprah tits right there!
"
18,1,Cartman,"Well that's fine! You can't call yourself ""Washington Redskins!""
"
17,2,Stan,"That's impossible. Are you guys sure you set it up right?
"
2,8,Kyle,"What'd he say?
"
6,2,Stan,"...Thank you.
"
2,10,Cartman,"It's about friggin' time! Give me that! 
"
12,13,Wendy,"I would never leave you for Bridon.
"
10,3,Kyle,"No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad.
"
9,6,Stan,"Mom!
"
17,1,Cartman,"No! What Alec Baldwin commercial?
"
6,17,Cartman,"Really?
"
3,4,Kyle,"Shut up, fatass!!
"
15,1,Cartman,"Oh my God, isn't it awesome having an iPad, you guys?  Hey Bebe, where's your iPad? Oh right, you're not cool enough!  Hey, hey, did you see my iPad, Token? Funny, you don't seem to have one! I thought your family was rich!  Haha! You dumbasses have to play four-square 'cause you don't have iPads!  Oh, what should I do on my iPad next? Think I'll email some of my friends. Oh no, wait! Maybe I'll download some more cool apps!  This is so awesome! 
"
4,2,Stan,"This is the smartest business venture ever. 
"
13,3,Stan,"No, dude, that doesn't make sense!
"
9,11,Kyle,"What's the big deal? Don't you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman's hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?
"
12,12,Randy,"BOOOO! 
"
10,3,Stan,"What? What's the big deal?
"
3,5,Cartman,"Open this door!
"
18,3,Cartman,"It it done?! It is all ready?! Alright alright, move aside everybody, move aside please. I gotta go.  Oh! Ahm. This is gonna be so awesome.  Aha! Lock! Privacy. Oh, this is gonna feel so good!  Perfect.  Yeah, you're gonna take it. You're all alone now, toilet. Nobody can hear you scream. Yeah, you're gonna open wide.  You're gonna TAKE your punishment! That's right! Get ready!  Oh my God, this is so awesome you guys! It's just like at home!
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh yeah, we don't want our kids getting hurt playing football! But I think I have a way to make it even better! Why don't we have the players just wear bras?!
"
6,9,Stan,"Waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song.
"
8,14,Stan,"You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow.
"
10,14,Stan,"Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here.  We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in.
"
6,16,Randy,"Yeah, but we can't be sure, so we'd better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette, huh?
"
7,6,Stan,"All right, sir, well, please call us if you need anything. 
"
7,13,Mr. Mackey,"Well hey, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you boys have been smoking!
"
13,6,Stan,"Yes I do.
"
16,12,Kenny,"Yes. We saw their faces.
"
6,7,Cartman,"You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe it! 
"
2,15,Cartman,"Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!
"
10,14,Stan,"... I don't know.
"
7,12,Stan,"No. I'm... I'm gonna kick your ass.
"
11,1,Stan,"What was his point?
"
4,4,Timmy,"Heh-aaaaaah!
"
1,6,Stan,"Come on you guys, let's go home. 
"
2,10,Mr. Garrison,"Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, ""How I would make America better.""
"
14,7,Stan,"Today is Towelie's intervention. We have ...no idea how he's gonna react.
"
9,6,Butters,"You died?? How??
"
9,10,Stan,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, you just need to not drink so much. It's very simple.
"
16,9,Cartman,"It is a violation of my civil rights, Token, and you should be ashamed of yourself!
"
9,5,Stan,"Wow, he IS great at sucking.
"
15,1,Kyle,"(Yes! Please! Let me go!)
"
9,14,Randy,"Uh... a disease?
"
8,11,Jimmy,"This isn't the news, this is a tr-tr-tr-tr-travesty.
"
6,17,Jimmy,"Eight... maids are... milking...
"
5,2,Jimmy,"No!  Ow!
"
6,6,Cartman,"Alrighty then. 
"
14,6,Stan,"We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.
"
3,12,Cartman,"How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?
"
7,15,Kyle,"Please, you guys, you don't understand.  My family is devastated. My mom just walks around the house like a zombie, and my dad can't stop crying.
"
2,3,Stan,"If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?
"
10,11,Butters,"Well damn, nigger, there's gotta be some way!
"
7,11,Cartman,"We have no choice, Butters! We have to lock you away somewhere where even I can't get to you!
"
14,9,Cartman,"What does it want?!
"
11,9,Randy,"Come on! That's pretty impressive!  Wha-hey Stan! Stan, look at this. 
"
6,10,Stan,"Kyle??
"
15,8,Cartman,"Next order, please! Get your Cartman Burgers here, fresh and flavorful.
"
13,14,Butters,"Yeah, come on, Kyle, I'm not the only person who's peed in the pool. Lots of people do.
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me.
"
11,14,Butters,"You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
"
6,8,Cartman,"Aw, dude, I think I might have it.
"
14,3,Randy,"My huh?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Oh. Good idea, Phillip. Let's look for treasuh.
"
4,10,Cartman,"You are, too!
"
7,8,Stan,"Hey Craig.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Aww, screw you guys anyway!
"
18,1,Cartman,"It's sooo sweet!
"
17,10,Wendy,"That's not a jelly school, that's a Dunkin' Donuts!
"
15,9,Butters,"Hey, where are you going?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Yeah I got the stuff.  And I got the money. 
"
18,9,Randy,"What is that supposed to mean?
"
1,5,Stan,"Thanks a lot.
"
2,12,Stan,"...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!
"
11,10,Kyle,"Uh... W-uh... but... Come o- come on! Really? I mean, aren't there more important things going on right now?
"
10,4,Kyle,"Do the right thing, Mr. President.
"
6,16,Butters,"This lady'll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars. Well that's a pretty good deal.
"
11,4,Cartman,"No no, he's my lead. 
"
2,18,Stan,"Holy crap. dude!
"
6,14,Stan,"N-no?
"
6,12,Kyle,"There's not gonna be any robot guards, retard! Just get Kenny! 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, no. What are they doing?
"
6,1,Cartman,"Uh, yes, we'd like one order of the City Beef.
"
7,1,Cartman,"No, go ahead. I'm dry.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Fellas, are you sure all of this ie-eh-ethical?
"
15,9,Cartman,"Oh God! 
"
11,13,Stan,"Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while.
"
7,14,Butters,"Yup!
"
14,3,Randy,"Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon!
"
12,13,Stan,"I don't know. There's nothin' I can do about it anyway.
"
2,10,Stan,"Sshh! Cartman!
"
6,4,Butters,"Ew, they're all dirty.
"
7,9,Kyle,"Until we get people to stop downloading music for free, I say we refuse to play!
"
4,8,Stan,"But Chef, we don't know what you're talking about.
"
6,9,Stan,"Okay, uh, we wanna thank you all for coming. We're really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause.
"
12,4,Kyle,"Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn't matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.
"
17,6,Kyle,"But that is what happened! It is! Tell them, Cartman!
"
10,2,Mr. Mackey,"It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay? 
"
2,12,Cartman,"Fine! That's fine. 
"
6,3,Cartman,"Uh yes, I'm sure I can convince him to come on the show.  There will of course be a prize involved?  Great. I'll call you back in an hour.  No, thank you.  YES!
"
12,6,Randy,"Come on, Stan, let's get some rest. 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Ji- Jimmay?
"
5,6,Kyle,"Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh... 
"
1,11,Wendy,"No, it's not. Since you're here to stay, I just hope we can be friends.
"
9,1,Kyle,"But Jews can't play basketball! 
"
16,12,Kyle,"We still have an hour before the costume contest, so let's hit the house on the uh-
"
14,2,Randy,"Butters? Is that true?
"
6,6,Cartman,"Token's a smartass.
"
14,10,Randy,"It's me! Up here!  I'm a butterfly!
"
14,5,Stan,"You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! 
"
6,5,Butters,"Butters! Aw, I lose, huh?
"
2,18,Stan,"What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!
"
1,3,Kyle,"I like chocolate milk.
"
5,8,Stan,"Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine!  Here's your stupid lighter. 
"
11,2,Butters,"Sure, I like like you a lot a lot. 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Ellen, comedy is like a game of racquetball, you know? You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you've got a good joke. Thank you.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Cool.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Oh. Really?
"
18,6,Randy,"It's not drinking. It's called a White Zinfandel Sipping Sprint, and it's competitive. Get off your high fuckin' horse.
"
1,3,Randy,"Mayor, we have got a very big problem. Mt. Evanston is about to erupt.
"
16,5,Stan,"...What, what was the question again?
"
7,8,Cartman,"Yeah, that jacket is so September 10th. 
"
14,6,Cartman,"Cheer up? I'm half ginger!
"
3,8,Stan,"Dude!
"
1,7,Stan,"Yeah, she had Sweetie Pops.
"
3,16,Stan,"Can I come in?
"
1,6,Mr. Garrison,"No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me. 
"
18,2,Wendy,"So then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on 'em? I'm pretty sure Scott Malkinson still has diabetes.
"
13,6,Randy,"That's right, yep, you're the first ones.
"
3,1,Stan,"Hey, look over there. Isn't that smoke? 
"
3,14,Stan,"Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because the bet was that the South doesn't win the war! And the South still didn't win the war, dipshit!
"
17,8,Butters,"Uhhhh, it's two kids who want to know what happens when the dragons show up?  Hello?
"
16,9,Cartman,"I don't give a shit, dude! Nobody beats my ratings! Get me a plane ticket! That bitch is going down! 
"
4,10,Cartman,"Who's in there?
"
18,7,Kyle,"You mean he's actually stuck in virtual reality?!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Fine, Kyle! But if something goes wrong out there on the planet surface, don't hold me responsible.
"
6,3,Kyle,"Yeah. I bet they could make a fake set of balls. Come on, Butters!
"
13,11,Stan,"Will you stop that?
"
5,6,Cartman,"Mom, it's 3:30. This is taking up my whole Saturday.
"
14,5,Cartman,"Yeah, so what?
"
10,10,Kyle,"Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-
"
10,12,Butters,"Who, me?
"
1,9,Cartman,"Well.  Ol' Kyle's gonna be locked up for a while, so get used to it.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!
"
9,7,Cartman,"Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, sorry, I taped these at home, so there's more commercials. 
"
4,16,Butters,"Oh, I'm gonna be sacrificed to the Provider!
"
9,9,Butters,"AAAAAAAH NOO! Witches! You're all witches! 
"
18,7,Kyle,"I know it's hard to believe, but you have to trust me.
"
1,4,Kenny,"(Oh my God, I think they're screwing.)
"
10,2,Cartman,"You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! 'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Huh? Oh, I get it, Kyle. That's your Serbian Jew double bluff. Make me think you don't care about being in the commercial so that maybe I won't either. Ooops. didn't work, did it, Kyle?
"
7,15,Kyle,"French Canada?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Dateline. Right.  I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! 
"
3,13,Cartman,"Aww, see? That's what I was gonna say!
"
1,6,Cartman,"Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming.
"
7,8,Cartman,"You hear that, Kenny? Stan thinks we should tell Kyle not to hang around us anymore. I think he's right. Good luck telling him, Stan. I... know it won't be easy.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Clyde? Where the hell is Clyde? Clyde?
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"No, it wasn't you, Timmy. Try again.
"
2,3,Kyle,"I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?
"
2,17,Stan,"Yeah, that makes sense.
"
13,1,Kyle,"You want Tammy to give you a B.J.?
"
16,4,Butters,"Eric, stop it!
"
5,11,Stan,"So dude, did Cartman's idea work?
"
6,6,Kyle,"Well Token was a definite winner for talent show. But then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game, to see how we got along there.
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Is he going to live?
"
5,8,Cartman,"No! ...No!
"
13,10,Kyle,"Cool!
"
13,10,Butters,"Okey doke.
"
2,16,Stan,"They're dead to me. My mom doesn't even know I'm here.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Okay. Where were we, Kenny? Oh yeah.  ""Quick, Captain, we must destroy the Gengrin across the fire."" Give me the space cruiser. Give it, Kenny. M'yah!
"
10,2,Randy,"I know it's not a real ticket!!
"
4,8,Cartman,"The rest of you, go get the goods on Stan! His mom grounded him once for setting something on fire. Let's find out what that something was, and then lie and say it was a puppy.
"
9,6,Butters,"Well, jeez Eric, why wouldn't I be able to hear you?
"
5,7,Randy,"Well, you know, when you do that to a m-male... the... eh eh you make his... stuff come out.  Well, Jesus, haven't they taught you these things at school?!
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh no, not the video sabotage, uh.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Welcome to S-super School News. I'm Jimmy Valmer.
"
1,11,Wendy,"I was just in the bathroom, and Ms. Ellen was in there taking the biggest dump I've ever seen.
"
3,3,Stan,"Come on Cartman!
"
2,12,Kyle,"Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?
"
9,3,Stan,"We've gotta split up and find Wing! You and Kenny go that way! 
"
6,12,Stan,"Excuse me.  Excuse me!  Uh, we ran out of stuff.  We ran out of stuff to build the ladder with.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Butters...  Butters! You can see me??
"
2,12,Cartman,"So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?
"
18,10,Kyle,"PewDiePie?!
"
16,6,Kyle,"E-excuse me, w-we aren't going back now? Aren't we done?
"
7,1,Kyle,"Dude, for the last time, don't call my brother a dildo!
"
3,2,Cartman,"Oh, where are you gonna go, Kenny? You gonna see your little girlfriend again?
"
12,2,Kyle,"Did you guys hear that?! A hundred thousand dollars for a picture of Britney.
"
13,11,Stan,"No- Dude, we really can't take any more volunteers.
"
11,1,Stan,"No he's not.  Is he?
"
1,10,Stan,"Holy crap, dude. Satan is huge.
"
17,2,Wendy,"I have to agree with Cartman. Maybe we overreacted when our parents-
"
15,13,Cartman,"Clyde Donovan said that he saw on the news there's gonna be a massive stuffing shortage! Get your coat on, Mom! We've gotta go to the store! 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Well, come on guys, it's probably a Jewpacabra but this isn't definitive.
"
3,10,Stan,"Juuhachi is eighteen, Garrison-san.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Of course he sings. He's black.
"
4,9,Kyle,"I promised my mom I'd let him try. 
"
1,8,Kyle,"But I thought we were supposed to care on Thanksgiving.
"
6,9,Stan,"Yeah, let's see if anyone has even shown up yet.  Dude, there's like a thousand people in there!
"
12,9,Wendy,"Yes you did! You just stood there and said you apologize and you don't want to fight!
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, it's Sexual Harassment Panda.
"
6,4,Cartman,"We'll give you one calf, if you give us... some guns and ammunition of our own.
"
9,13,Cartman,"Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?
"
7,7,Randy,"You... must find a cure for SARS, son. And save our people.
"
12,9,Cartman,"You don't have to say anything. I know how it is. I'm no longer the cool kid. Now you all think I'm a fahahahahahag.  My school life is over 'cause now all the guys don't think I'm coooohoohoohoohoohooooool. 
"
9,6,Butters,"So I won't see you again?
"
17,3,Cartman,"That was, he was on my ground. You all saw that, right? Everything inside the red line is mine.  Inside the red line is, that's- that's my ground. He was on it. 
"
12,3,Randy,"Let's hear it for Gerald!
"
14,9,Kyle,"All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll...  Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?
"
1,7,Wendy,"Oh, I didn't want all that sweet stuff. I gave it away to hungry children in Nairobi.
"
10,12,Cartman,"Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away.  I have to be hidden.  That's good.  And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!
"
18,2,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, you see that? His dick's flyin' off. 
"
3,6,Stan,"Okay, yyou are a panda. But being Sexual Harassment Panda isn't helping anyone right now. You used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment. But now you need to teach a new message. A new massage that people will find useful again.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(No we don't, guys.)
"
12,8,Butters,"Well I thought it was pretty good.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Just come on! It's getting dark.
"
13,14,Cartman,"I've been counting. Do you know there are two hundred and five Mexicans here? and there are a hundred and ninety black people!
"
11,10,Cartman,"Yes, come on in, peasant Kyle, and pay homage to this sultan's balls.
"
13,13,Stan,"""Or does she?""
"
5,13,Cartman,"In the ...hospital? Why?
"
6,16,Butters,"Look, you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks.
"
2,3,Cartman,"I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these. 
"
14,9,Cartman,"Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool.  It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out.
"
6,17,Jimmy,"Alright, h-here it goes. On the first day of C-...c...c.. chrih.. stmas my tr... t-tru-true love g-geh... g-g-geh... gave... to... m..m-m-m...m-mm-m-m... me... a pa... a pa... pah...
"
8,13,Kyle,"What's going on?
"
12,3,Cartman,"Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep 'cause it pissed me off.  Shh. Mr. Kitty, you have to live in the attic for now.  Here. Write a diary.
"
5,8,Stan,"Jesus, is Cartman still in the bathroom?
"
14,4,Wendy,"You DO have a Facebook page, Stan!
"
15,11,Randy,"She's too young for that stuff!
"
4,9,Stan,"Dude, we don't have any musical talent.
"
1,9,Cartman,"Yeah?  Well I sneaked around my mom's closet too, and saw what I'm getting.  The Ultravibe Pleasure 2000.
"
8,4,Randy,"You did it, son! You did it!
"
1,12,Cartman,"Oh no you don't! Finders Keepers!
"
2,10,Kyle,"Huh?
"
1,1,Kyle,"Just make sweet love down by the fire.
"
8,1,Kyle,"We have to get past them!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Come on, man, this isn't funny!  I need my fix! 
"
15,5,Stan,"What?
"
11,13,Butters,"Uh ohhh.
"
1,13,Stan,"Man! Cartman's gonna be famous! 
"
3,10,Stan,"No.  Screw this, dude. 
"
12,10,Cartman,"Por favor, buy our CDs de musica. 
"
4,3,Cartman,"Sarque du Son Bleu.  Oho, we've reached fag factor 5, captain.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Yeah but the blood's on Clyde's wiener, not mine.
"
2,14,Cartman,"Wow, he’s good.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Nice teamwork, Nut Gobbler.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih! Timmih!
"
5,8,Stan,"Alright, so where is it?
"
10,12,Stan,"Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
"
8,11,Butters,"I know! We should read the funnies!  I always get good ideas from the funnies.
"
3,11,Stan,"Dude, it looks like he's tried everywhere in the world. 
"
1,3,Randy,"And my calculations worked: the lava is following the trench into the canyon.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"The Park County School Board has approved a bigger budget for the computer lab up-
"
6,6,Butters,"Prepare, O little town! Uh prepare for the greatest supervillain you've ever seen! Professor Chaos! 
"
6,7,Stan,"Ready. Let's see 'em.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Butters, Butters, I'm, I'm kind of super busy right now.
"
12,4,Kyle,"Ike. Ike!  It's over.
"
8,4,Kyle,"Hey, who are those kids? 
"
3,12,Kyle,"Shouldn't we hide her better than that?
"
9,12,Kyle,"What secret truth??
"
16,6,Cartman,"The trees' biology?
"
4,9,Randy,"You get in the truck right now! 
"
3,17,Stan,"You know what you guys are? You guys are nothing but mung?
"
3,3,Cartman,"Ey!
"
2,16,Stan,"Dude, I don't know how long I can stay here.
"
11,10,Kyle,"Dad, where do leprechauns come from?
"
1,3,Kyle,"Hey look, Kenny's okay.
"
2,18,Cartman,"There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!
"
3,6,Kyle,"This is freaking me out, dude.
"
16,2,Stan,"Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
"
10,8,Stan,"We did it!
"
3,12,Kyle,"Yeah, fatass, we're gonna dig up-  Dig up Kyle's dead grandma??
"
7,6,Kyle,"Dude, we've been working this case since two-thirty!
"
15,14,Cartman,"What the? Dude, this is like poorer than my old house!
"
12,2,Stan,"Jesus Christ!
"
13,11,Randy,"Well Stan, the Japanese just... don't really like dolphins very much. Certainly not as much as us normal people do. But hey, at least you still got your T-shirt!   And you always have your neat picture. 
"
5,12,Kyle,"No dude. Because since you got your feelings so hurt for being ripped on, now we think you're a pussy.
"
10,1,Stan,"Immortal.
"
10,6,Cartman,"No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, I know a certain young man who's itching for a detention.  Aaaaaah!  Ooooh.
"
13,9,Cartman,"Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today.
"
4,4,Stan,"Oh boy oh boy.
"
9,2,Randy,"My God...
"
8,5,Cartman,"I would like some Sunny Delight too.
"
10,9,Kyle,"Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth.
"
5,1,Cartman,"I was just-  I was just watching the TV! They had this commercial.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Hey
"
17,6,Stan,"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
"
1,5,Kyle,"Aren't they ever gonna wake up?
"
2,15,Cartman,"That's right, I did!You guys are hella stupidYou guys are hella lameYou guys are hella dumbHella hella hella!
"
3,4,Wendy,"Yeah, if you're gonna do it, do it!
"
1,11,Stan,"Sorry.
"
18,6,Kyle,"Waitwaitwait, Jimmy told you about this game?
"
8,1,Stan,"What's your ninja name, Kenny?
"
3,17,Kenny,"(Nope.)
"
1,2,Cartman,"You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Heheheh, buns.
"
10,2,Stan,"Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
"
9,4,Kyle,"Wuh what'd I do?
"
18,10,Cartman,"What's it look like I'm doing? I'm trending, Kyle. I'm trending more than I ecer thought possible.
"
3,12,Cartman,"It wasn't me! 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Oh my God, dude!
"
10,9,Stan,"Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? 
"
15,13,Butters,"Okay Dad.
"
7,6,Stan,"I don't know.
"
4,1,Cartman,"I'm sorry, Token.
"
1,3,Stan,"Celery?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Oh, god damnit! 
"
3,3,Cartman,"I can't see anything!
"
17,6,Cartman,"Well alright. 
"
10,1,Stan,"...WHAT??
"
5,12,Cartman,"Oh, well, let me take this disk up to the Enterprise and see if Captain Kirk can decrypt it. 
"
13,11,Stan,"Oh the Japanese wanna play that way, huh?!
"
2,17,Stan,"Oh, not Tweek.
"
8,5,Butters,"Remember I said I put that medicinal suppository in my anus? It'll be so much easier havin' you do it from now on.
"
7,1,Cartman,"There's even World War Three to look forward to.
"
5,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh alright, have your way with me if you must! Go on, fulfill you sick pleasures! 
"
6,16,Stan,"Alright, where is that son-of-a-bitch's wallet?!
"
16,4,Butters,"He says he's not payin' us to scratch our buttholes. 
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"No it isn't, it makes you very sad! Now, apparently, the school board thinks that I don't teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they're going to have you do presentations for the whole board.
"
16,3,Cartman,"I know. I know Kyle. 
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Where-eh, where am I?
"
12,10,Stan,"All right guys, just like we rehearsed it. You ready Craig? All right, let's jam!
"
12,2,Kyle,"What?!
"
4,8,Cartman,"I mean, Germany was united under the swastika, right? But,… obviously history wasn't as important as changing the views after the war and stuff, so hey changed it.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Yes we do! Just not the Christian heaven!
"
12,2,Kyle,"Oh crap! 
"
8,14,Cartman,"All right, fine! Forget it! 
"
6,9,Cartman,"What could possibly go wrong?
"
2,12,Randy,"I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse.
"
13,13,Wendy,"No, it's okay! It's all out in the open now. I wouldn't have had to kill the Smurfs if they would have simply moved on. But you gave them the will to stay, and I guess... you can't be blamed for that.
"
4,10,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
16,7,Cartman,"Kyle, Jesus Christ!
"
15,11,Randy,"Whassup brah?!
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"WOW! That's it! That's the nose I want!
"
8,9,Randy,"Oh all right, em maybe I was gonna buy a glass. One glass! ... And some chips... And butter.  And some new pliers.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Thank you. The Latino culture has been very influential on the arts in America. But you don't have to ask me. You can ask my special guest. Miss Jennifer Lopez.
"
14,4,Stan,"Okay, I'm sorry!
"
4,8,Kyle,"No, see? There's people of all colors. And they added a black guy as one of the hangers, too, so it's not racist.
"
4,13,Cartman,"I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once.
"
6,10,Stan,"Yeah!
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh... Yeah, Mexico. You know oh, oh, yeah. All of us other countries chipped in and uh, gave Mexico some aid. Yeah they really needed... some new water parks.
"
7,7,Stan,"An inward journey? That sounds kind of gay.
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Yes. I'm looking for some morning-after abortion-)
"
9,10,Stan,"You've set it all up to look like you're this awesome prince and I'm just a loser!
"
3,8,Butters,"Huh how come they're actin' that way, Stan, huh? Uh how come they're laughin' and fallin' down and such?
"
9,14,Stan,"What?? Did you go to your AA meeting?!
"
1,6,Stan,"I don't know what to do dude, my grampa really wants to die.
"
13,10,Kyle,"What are you talking about?
"
11,1,Stan,"Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it!  Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it.
"
7,3,Cartman,"What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.
"
6,4,Kyle,"We're with you, Stan.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Aw dude, you shot him in the dick.
"
1,4,Kyle,"Hike!
"
3,17,Kyle,"Huh?
"
8,7,Stan,"All right guys, come on. Let's go to the next house. 
"
1,3,Cartman,"Yeah hippie, go back to Woodstock if you can't shoot anything.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Stand back, mother! We're having a telekinetic battle of minds!
"
10,13,Cartman,"Who is this?
"
11,2,Butters,"All right. All right that does it!  I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was!  You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
"
16,8,Butters,"All right, first string, cover those wideouts. Tell 'em how much you like their outfits! Clyde, Token! Hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss. 
"
4,11,Cartman,"Well...
"
2,7,Cartman,"Was that how it happened?
"
10,12,Cartman,"All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed.  Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!
"
8,1,Stan,"With my tonfa of Takanawa, I become the great and powerful ninja Shadowhachi, born to fight evil and people I don't like.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Butters! Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
"
9,2,Cartman,"All right, everyone listen up! The hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick.
"
4,11,Cartman,"That's good, because right now, all the Jewness is comin' out of your body, bein' replaced by the Spirit of God-uh!  Theah!
"
9,2,Randy,"S-stan. STAAAN!
"
9,5,Randy,"They've worked really hard to get here, Chris, and, you know, I don't like to really ""trash-talk,"" but, I don't think Denver has a chance.
"
8,13,Cartman,"What?
"
3,3,Stan,"She's stealing Chef from us.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Prepare for battle! 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance!
"
9,13,Kyle,"Huh?
"
8,13,Stan,"Cartman thinks he can fly off of his roof. 
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"It has to be more stable, Mr. Hat! A moped would be too dangerous at those speeds. Damnit!  Now, what if the jet power of an aircraft could be scaled down into a personal vehicle?
"
16,12,Randy,"Hahaha, haha! You can be a spooky ghost all you want, it wasn't a stupid idea to buy this place!
"
12,13,Butters,"Awww jeez, you're no fun. 
"
11,12,Butters,"Huh... 
"
2,13,Kyle,"Is it like a- haunted house or something?
"
1,12,Kyle,"Whoa!
"
6,11,Randy,"Yeah, and you kicked ass!
"
15,13,Kenny,"(Go, dude!)
"
1,5,Stan,"Damn, I wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig. 
"
1,13,Stan,"This guy sucks! 
"
10,7,Cartman,"Mom, I need another energy drink! 
"
9,9,Butters,"Mom, Dad, can I come upstairs now?
"
10,9,Stan,"Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.
"
3,14,Butters,"Uh Topeka. We're raisin' all kinds of hell, see?  Eh, it's probably the most fun I've had in several months. Wuwell, you gonna read your message or not? 
"
4,16,Stan,"Parents?
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Really?) 
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Excuse me?
"
6,10,Cartman,"You bitch, I'll cut your throat if- 
"
9,8,Randy,"Get inside! We have to close these doors! 
"
3,14,Cartman,"Take the fort!
"
8,10,Kenny,"(And it's time for us to come clean.) 
"
9,13,Stan,"Thanks.  Is this the Mexican space program? 
"
3,11,Stan,"Screw you, Cartman! I called leader first!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Yes yes, that's what I need! I'll take that!
"
10,1,Kyle,"Good.
"
5,6,Stan,"Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?
"
8,12,Butters,"Loo loo loo, I've got some apples, Loo loo loo, you've got some too.
"
16,13,Stan,"We did it. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.
"
9,8,Randy,"Oh my God... That's today! 
"
16,10,Randy,"Yeah, sure, 'cause...  people just order stuff from Amazon and... forget what they got. 
"
8,13,Kyle,"What?!
"
16,6,Stan,"Uh that's okay.
"
16,2,Randy,"Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ours!
"
2,7,Kenny,"(Take... that!)  (You dick! That is for me, and that, that and that, that and that, that, that, that!) 
"
2,14,Kyle,"Yeah. Ready, Cartman?
"
3,11,Stan,"We don't know. 
"
5,6,Kyle,"Great. 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Sir, we would love to sign your wife.
"
11,4,Cartman,"You can't possible mean...?
"
14,9,Randy,"What is it?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Oh, my ears feel like they're frozen off, and I think I have a hemorrhoid from sitting on the sled for so long.
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Fellas, can I have a moment with Stan, please?
"
10,6,Stan,"Dude, he's really sick. 
"
6,3,Butters,"What?? W-why the heck would you do that. Wuh they wanna kill me for not bein' a real freak!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Alright, let's hear it for Kyle!  He's so funny, isn't he guys?! With all his jokes about Cartman being poor. You guys hear how poor Cartman's mom is?! His mom is so poor the ducks throw bread at her! Hahaha! That's super funny, guys!  Laugh it up, everyone!  Cartman's mom is so poor that when she goes to KFC, she has to lick other people's fingers! HA! I beat you to it, Kyel!
"
18,7,Stan,"Sound pretty typical to me.
"
2,17,Cartman,"Why can't we just read the paper we wrote last time?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!
"
5,8,Kyle,"Awesome!
"
7,10,Randy,"Oh My God!! 
"
8,9,Randy,"I know, I know! God!  Bleeeh! 
"
13,10,Cartman,"Oh, sweet! 
"
7,3,Kyle,"Oh.  Uuugh.
"
8,8,Stan,"He said I can stay.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Weh-hull, I could ask Artemus Clyde Frog. He would know.
"
2,4,Stan,"Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!
"
9,2,Cartman,"And you're gonna be here a little longer, brah, all right? Here, here's some joints , and a guitar! 
"
2,17,Cartman,"Little pussy gnome. Don't call me a pussy, pussy gnome.
"
10,12,Butters,"Oh jeez! 
"
6,13,Stan,"How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
"
2,11,Cartman,"Yes! I'm the best!
"
1,1,Cartman,"He's not dead.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Okay, now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision. 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.
"
5,6,Stan,"It is stupid, Cartman! You made Kyle lose his faith in God, you fat asshole!
"
14,8,Cartman,"All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
"
6,6,Kyle,"Good point. 
"
15,8,Stan,"Aliens?
"
8,2,Timmy,"Huh... Timmih...  Timmih.
"
13,3,Kyle,"Now look! The reason we're in this situation is because people are being stupid! The economy isn't some vengeful being that takes things away from us. The economy is just made up of people, and people have just lost their faith in it.  What people really should be doing is spending more. Spending is fine. People should just go outside. People should just go outside. They should buy the things they need for their friends and family
"
6,4,Cartman,"Hippies!
"
15,11,Randy,"And hold!  Sorry folks, we're in a hold. Just freeze right there.  Uhh, this better be important.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Freeze! Put your hands in the air!
"
2,11,Kyle,"Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah...)
"
7,6,Cartman,"Yes, retard. Semen comes from your wiener. Now do it!  Well Butters?!
"
6,7,Cartman,"Be you not jealous, Jew. I am creator of all things, yea.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.
"
1,1,Cartman,"I don't want powdered donut pancake surprise. All the kids at school call me fat!
"
17,5,Kyle,"I don't know what else to do, dude. No matter what I try, me and Ike just seem to drift further apart!
"
16,11,Stan,"You're talking about Butters.
"
17,8,Cartman,"It isn't that. Princess Kenny is loved by her army , but Stan is still the nuts and ball of her operation.  It would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their PlayStations if Stan were to be...  grounded?
"
1,11,Stan,"Well, I guess I'm sorry that I was ignoring you and stuff.
"
2,14,Kyle,"You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you.
"
3,10,Cartman,"No, Kitty, you can't have these chicken tenders, because they are mine, and I keep mine to myself, oh?
"
1,4,Kyle,"Ah, dude, weak.
"
2,9,Stan,"Yeah, pretty much.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Mom, Dad!  They're gonna kill her! They're going to in-. Wait, what are you doing here?
"
2,18,Stan,"Huh, excuse me?
"
18,3,Cartman,"Dude! You need to put a tighter leash on your dog!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Heyesss.
"
13,5,Kyle,"Craig, if Cartman didn't do anything, then he doesn't deserve any of the credit!
"
4,16,Stan,"Awesu-home!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Here, Butters!
"
7,1,Cartman,"You know the feeling when the huge dump you just took shoots back up inside your ass? NO I""M NOT ALL RIGHT!!
"
6,13,Randy,"I know where it is! 
"
6,6,Butters,"People of Earth! Your meaningless lives are about to end! I am Professor Chaos,  and this is my partner ih-in evil, General Disarray! In the past few days I have rained terror down upon the society that shunned me! And now it is time for my Labor of Lonely! I am going to... flood... the world!
"
14,5,Randy,"Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on Muhammad, we don't want to piss off Tom Cruise again. 
"
12,2,Stan,"Kyle, what the fuck is going on now?
"
2,2,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
16,7,Butters,"How come?
"
10,8,Stan,"'K.
"
9,8,Randy,"You just stay put, son! I'm coming for you! Do you hear me?? I'm coming for you!! 
"
6,16,Stan,"Yeah.
"
6,14,Kyle,"Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.
"
4,1,Stan,"Sshh! 
"
4,11,Kenny,"(Um...) 
"
10,13,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison! 
"
15,8,Mr. Garrison,"No. Butters, that's not how it works.
"
18,4,Randy,"Geez!
"
18,1,Kyle,"How are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken?!
"
8,6,Kyle,"Jesus Christ, dude!
"
9,3,Kyle,"Stupid talent agents!
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"...and strong vulgar language...
"
5,13,Cartman,"What is this, a PTA meeting? 
"
1,6,Kyle,"Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
"
13,6,Stan,"This trophy isn't mine, and so I have to give it back! Because if I'm not honest now, then I'll have to keep this lie going forever. And it will just grow and grow. 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Okay, let's hear your bark, Butters.
"
1,1,Cartman,"No! Uh-I mean, eh, why would they do that?
"
11,12,Kyle,"Huh? 
"
5,9,Stan,"Ah, sorry. Miss Nicks isn't answering any more questions.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Time for you to get proven wrong, fat boy.
"
18,1,Cartman,"It's a strong name, dude. It's like agressive and masculine like Boner Forest, but Boner Forest was taken.
"
4,6,Kyle,"Seriously.
"
13,11,Stan,"Really?  People who are doing something?
"
16,13,Stan,"Thanks Kyle.
"
1,5,Cartman,"Eh, it's okay Fluffy, nobody's going to hurt you.
"
11,5,Randy,"We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us.  We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men.
"
8,9,Randy,"Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya. 
"
2,9,Stan,"They what?!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Yes. You can flip us off, Craig. We deserve that. We just came by to apologize. We feel so bad.
"
15,13,Cartman,"Dumbass, it's November.  The History Channel is probably playing Thanksgiving specials back to back. We can learn everything we need.
"
15,8,Stan,"I don't want everything to go back to the way it was!  I, I don't.  You were right, Kyle. Sometimes, the only way to go forward, is to take a big left turn. I've been resisting it, but I'm ready now. I want you to stay with Cartman Burger, dude. It's okay. You're gonna do this and I'm gonna do my thing and ...my mom and dad aren't getting back together. But you know what? It's okay. In fact, it's better. Change is gonna bring new things to all of us. Where will Cartman Burger go from here? That'll be cool to see. And it opens me up to a whole new adventure, exploring... new relationships with all new people in town.  Maybe this kid will become my new best friend.  Or maybe this kid will.
"
6,6,Kyle,"Towelie is cool, but he gets stoned all the time. You can't really rely on him for anything.
"
4,12,Stan,"Oh, son of a bitch!
"
6,5,Stan,"Me neither. I'll be dead before the commercials. Wait a minute! I forgot there's a black and white television back at my house!
"
1,12,Cartman,"Sweet! I'm gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn't given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass! 
"
10,10,Cartman,"I knew it! 
"
13,11,Cartman,"Your show is fuckin' gay, dude!
"
12,6,Stan,"What's so funny about that?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Duhude, dude,  not cool!
"
12,9,Cartman,"...Huh? 
"
1,1,Cartman,"What? Well, that does sound pretty good.  Uh, Mom?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!
"
11,12,Stan,"Dude you have to stall them!  Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!
"
4,13,Stan,"You break it down!
"
5,11,Kyle,"Ah-ah-ah-are wooden desks all that available? I usually prefer the plastic ones because these give me splinters.
"
7,7,Randy,"Stan? Okay?
"
6,8,Stan,"What are they talking about?
"
6,16,Stan,"Yeah!
"
2,2,Cartman,"Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak.
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. Kids, we need to talk about your failing grades.
"
3,11,Stan,"Yeah, so it would be really cool if you would let Marvin and all his people come live here.
"
3,2,Randy,"The little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend. It wasn't the girl that caused him to combust, it was the fact that Kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her.  You see, as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas.  The methane gathers here in the bowel area , where it causes pressure. Normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart.  Should the gas not be expelled,  the methane can build up and then ignite,  leading to... disaster.  Kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long.
"
5,8,Stan,"Come on, dude! 
"
17,2,Randy,"Sharon, I'm I'm sorry. 
"
8,7,Stan,"Oh, but that's the problem! Those goobacks are taking our jobs!
"
14,4,Stan,"Jesus Christ.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Yeah, they're gonna get busted again.
"
5,3,Stan,"Super best friends?
"
4,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, God is our refuge and strength, m'kay. A very present help in trouble, m'kay.  Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea...
"
1,8,Cartman,"Ahh!
"
8,4,Randy,"So what happened?
"
18,7,Butters,"...What? What do you mean?
"
1,4,Stan,"And maybe - we can beat 'em even more next year!
"
12,9,Wendy,"Oh my God!
"
6,5,Cartman,"Argh!
"
7,11,Kyle,"Oh, awesome.
"
10,8,Cartman,"Command-0. 
"
4,3,Cartman,"And shopping malls! Hooray! 
"
6,10,Stan,"That's such a great paper! 
"
18,7,Butters,"Yeah.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Jakov, I want you to meet my friends.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Arrghh!
"
3,2,Stan,"Dude, that's my dad!
"
7,1,Kyle,"Please don't cancel us. Please.
"
12,9,Wendy,"You think you're tough?
"
10,3,Kyle,"I got some sound advice... from an old friend. 
"
8,14,Stan,"Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil.
"
9,10,Stan,"Fine!
"
11,13,Stan,"Hang on.
"
13,13,Cartman,"The smurfs and I grew to understand each other.  They shared with me their art of picking Smurfberries, and I shared with them stories of my country's forefathers. Of course, it wasn't long before ...I fell in love with Smurfette.  We're from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion.
"
18,7,Stan,"How do you know?
"
6,7,Cartman,"It's alright, Chef! We got our sea people out of the teacher's stomach and we put them back in their aquarium!
"
6,1,Stan,"He's losing weight. 
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Flora, you have to pick one. Filmore or Ike?
"
6,8,Stan,"That sounds pretty fun.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!
"
6,16,Jimmy,"In her... va-vagina.  Thank you, thank you. What a terrific audience.
"
12,12,Butters,"Aw, poor ol' John McCain. Well he looks real sad.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Wow!
"
5,13,Cartman,"Mint condition, tax free.
"
4,13,Stan,"Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Yes. Who would take care of them?
"
16,1,Cartman,"Hah. Yeah, well, I'm just glad that stupid TSA crap is over with. I know you've had a tough week, Clyde. But at least your mom didn't die for nothing. I mean, we're kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of American freedom. So technically, your mom did die for nothing, but... Clyde? Clyde?
"
15,7,Stan,"Oh shit.
"
3,8,Randy,"Uh, you bet we are, Gerry! I feel great! I feel like I could take on the world! Everything's gonna be okay!
"
16,10,Cartman,"Yeah, it's um... it's uloveboobs.
"
12,10,Kenny,"(Because they're trying to take over the world?)
"
3,7,Cartman,"What?? Ih- is she okay?
"
2,11,Cartman,"Aw man, screw this. 
"
1,7,Stan,"Wendy said that first prize is two tons of candy.
"
6,15,Cartman,"Ha-heheheh.  That was Kenny laughing, not me.
"
2,7,Cartman,"It's completely immature! 
"
10,2,Cartman,"I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
"
6,4,Stan,"Damnit Butters, will you shut up?!
"
4,13,Stan,"He's right there.
"
1,12,Cartman,"Yeeh, stealth bombers  Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven't seen-
"
14,6,Cartman,"Daddy?
"
17,6,Kyle,"It's right over here by uh-
"
11,5,Stan,"He looks like a guy.
"
15,12,Kyle,"Hey dude, ah are you the guys messing with Cartman's stuffed animals?
"
3,15,Cartman,"that's why they're lame.
"
16,14,Stan,"What'd he say?  Oh. Well what do you mean the election isn't the biggest thing that happened this week? 
"
10,3,Cartman,"All right, let's roll! 
"
5,3,Stan,"I'm going home.
"
16,7,Cartman,"NOOOOOOO. 
"
2,11,Cartman,"Eric Cartman.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Yeahyeah, Mom. I-I can't go to the lake. No, S-stan's having emotional problems and I need to help see him through it. He's got-  wha-what is it?
"
14,3,Randy,"SCORE! 
"
8,9,Randy,"I can't make it, boys! You're gonna have to go on without me!
"
15,2,Cartman,"What's this?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Is this cool or not? I can't tell.
"
7,15,Cartman,"I'm gonna kill you, Kyle.
"
10,8,Randy,"Stan?! Stan!  Sharon, where is Stan?!
"
2,8,Stan,"Shut up, Pip.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Set phasers on stun.
"
2,16,Kyle,"It doesn't matter. He'll be most excited to meet me!
"
10,14,Randy,"Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day.
"
12,13,Cartman,"But he finally got the courage to answer his heart's call.
"
11,2,Butters,"Oh uh, ho yeah.
"
14,8,Cartman,"We're tradin' paint!  Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!
"
13,10,Cartman,"It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"I'm just thinking out loud.  Do you have anything to say, Skyler, Shelly's boyfriend who is sitting right heuh?
"
9,6,Cartman,"I'm not going to Heck, Butters! I'm not black, all right?!
"
7,1,Kyle,"Are you okay?
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"No, goddammit, it's eighteen!!
"
16,4,Kyle,"What are you gonna do?
"
15,5,Stan,"My parents told me Slash wasn't real when I was five. Jehesus Christ. 
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"No, this is gonna work! I called IntelliLink and they said they were sending over an engineer. 
"
1,5,Stan,"Oh my God!
"
8,6,Stan,"Jesus Christ! 
"
16,2,Cartman,"-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
"
17,7,Cartman,"Uh yeah, big dong and prosper. Um, listen guys, uh, uh, you're XBox people, right?
"
8,13,Cartman,"Do not doubt my powers, Kyle!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Look what the tooth fairy left me last night! 
"
4,2,Stan,"Chef!
"
5,1,Stan,"And besides, too much use of a dirty word takes away from its... impact. We believe in free speech and all that, but... keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of English.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Yeah, I like fishsticks.
"
16,6,Kyle,"I can't take it anymore.  Why do people say ""long story short""? They're not making it short, Stan.
"
7,9,Stan,"Yeah, you don't even know anything about Christianity.
"
14,4,Wendy,"By editing your profile under ""basic information""!
"
12,13,Butters,"Why, that's Bridon Gueermo. He's just a third grader, but he can sing and dance better than anybody.
"
6,5,Kyle,"Dude, thank God for stupid people 
"
7,14,Jimmy,"Jesus Christ, I think I've died and... gone to... heaven.
"
14,8,Kyle,"Aww. Well Cartman, you can change things about yourself.
"
17,10,Mr. Garrison,"Okay kids, there have been some hurtful and hateful things being said around this school, and so we are gonna hear from a guest speaker. Here to explain why Kim Kardashian is not a hobbit, please welcome, Aquaman. 
"
10,10,Cartman,"Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. 
"
12,14,Butters,"U-huh.  Ow.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Hey man, if you're Jewish you get presents for eight days.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, queef is a vaginal expulsion of gas, m'kay. 
"
5,13,Cartman,"Better.
"
3,15,Kyle,"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3,8,Randy,"It didn't mean anything to me, Gerry!  All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub! 
"
18,9,Cartman,"What the hell did I do?
"
2,18,Cartman,"Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about ""Greased Lightning.""  You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the-
"
5,1,Stan,"Me neither.
"
10,3,Randy,"Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it!  All right Sharon, now do me. 
"
8,13,Cartman,"I don't even know you dude!
"
11,14,Butters,"Okay.  Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest.
"
4,12,Kyle,"Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you'll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well Ellen, the tr- tr- tr-
"
17,6,Kyle,"No more. No more. Oh, come on, Cartman, no. No more. 
"
10,13,Cartman,"Listen to this!  Dickhead. 
"
2,17,Stan,"How do we stretch that into five minutes?
"
15,4,Cartman,"Oh, there's something we can do about it alright! If they're gonna put us on blast, they're at least gonna get the numbers right! We are going to remeasure!!
"
4,17,Stan,"Easy.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Aw, sick! 
"
2,4,Kyle,"Your heart?
"
13,14,Kyle,"AAAAAAAA!
"
12,14,Cartman,"All right Butters, will you go document the vampires' movements so we know what their intentions are.
"
16,12,Kyle,"Somebody's breaking into that Kum & Go.
"
2,10,Stan,"It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
"
1,12,Stan,"Oh, so you're really famous and important but you don't know John Elway!
"
13,4,Jimmy,"We're finally gonna learn the chocking truth of who Phillip f-farted on.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Dude, my mom and dad keep fighting all the time. And both of them say it's because my dad doesn't have a nurection. So I want to get him one.  Damn it! What the hell is wrong with everybody? 
"
7,14,Butters,"Well, mu mu mu girlfriend broke up with me.
"
3,7,Cartman,"You're never gonna get this picture! Not until my mom comes home and I can prove you had a boyfriend over heuh!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I wasn't good enough for you! Was that it, Dad?!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys!  You guys, please don't tell anybody.
"
2,17,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.
"
18,3,Cartman,"There's two more stall in here, gals. Go ahead.
"
18,9,Kyle,"This is how they talk to us!  You'd better watch your mouth, kid!
"
3,11,Stan,"This is great!
"
15,1,Kyle,"(Yes. I promise I'll read.)
"
15,7,Kyle,"Oh. Really? Um well that's okay.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Alright lads! Go home and write your farewell letters to your families! The land of pirates awaits! 
"
14,6,Kyle,"Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand.
"
1,5,Cartman,"Yeah, if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass, I'd be all like, ""Hey, listen, missy, eh, yewhy don't you go knit me sweater before I slap you in the face!""
"
6,14,Cartman,"Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work.
"
4,1,Cartman,"...What the hell is a hate crime?
"
4,15,Cartman,"God, I have to everything around here!
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Please, nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on your head, you're not being very open-minded.  Open your mind to your counselor. Open your mind.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby!  Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore...  ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Fuck you!
"
12,10,Kenny,"(Sir, please, I'm supposed to get laid for the first time on Saturday.)
"
2,15,Kyle,"Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Yes, I know.
"
18,8,Stan,"It was just decimation.
"
7,6,Stan,"Damn.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Yeah, yeah I do. I think we really had a breakthrough here.
"
10,8,Cartman,"There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do! 
"
15,5,Kyle,"I know, but dude, we can't license our games to EA Sports and pay the crack babies nothing. Slavery is illegal.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Thank you, Kyle.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Me neither.
"
1,2,Cartman,"I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!
"
6,15,Stan,"Yeah.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Don't think that you can buy me with presents! ...Unless of course it's the new Tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?
"
15,1,Kyle,"What is this? What's going on?
"
11,2,Butters,"Uh what do you mean?
"
15,1,Kyle,"Just let us see your iPad, Cartman.
"
5,7,Cartman,"I wasn't looking as his schlong, I was seeing how to put the condom on!
"
4,16,Kyle,"...Nothing.
"
8,7,Randy,"Well what are we waiting for?
"
2,7,Cartman,"Oh, man, this sucks.
"
17,7,Cartman,"Come on, Kyle. Let these Sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality. 
"
9,13,Kenny,"(What the fuck are you talking about?)
"
6,14,Stan,"Yeah, I have to remember that.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(But what?)
"
14,4,Randy,"Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?
"
5,9,Cartman,"God, what a craphole, dude! This is like East Denver! Jesus Chru-heist!
"
15,10,Stan,"Can't this thing go any faster?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Oh God! They're coming! They're coming! We gotta get out of here! They're coming this way!
"
1,11,Stan,"See? She liked my present the best!
"
15,11,Randy,"You didn't see the game? What the hell were you doing?
"
11,12,Stan,"Hello?
"
2,3,Stan,"I don't know. Let's go see. 
"
16,12,Stan,"Shhh. Don't say my name, Butters. I'm here undercover.
"
5,9,Cartman,"It's an Afghanistan goat, so it can't stay here, or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom.
"
3,8,Butters,"Hey, you know what we could do with these lady clothes, huh? Wuh-y why we could play Charlie's Angels.
"
7,6,Stan,"We do what we can, sir.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Sure. Now I will leave you tidings under your pillow. 
"
8,6,Cartman,"Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson. You're so awesome, Mr. Jefferson.
"
5,14,Butters,"I'm glad I found ya. I think I know the perfect anniversary present for Mom. But what are you doin' with your wiener out there, Dad?
"
6,17,Stan,"Oh my God. The Iraqis killed Jesus.
"
8,8,Randy,"You don't care?! You really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot?! On your football helmets?! A turd?!
"
15,1,Cartman,"Tom Saltzman's dad is an alcoholic who drinks and drives! 
"
17,2,Randy,"Oh yeah? What's that?  AAAGH!  Sharon, what the effing fuck was that?!
"
11,2,Kyle,"What are you talking about, fatass?
"
9,14,Randy,"Hi Bill.
"
5,2,Cartman,"Don't call me an asshole, you som' bitch.
"
10,13,Cartman,"Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!
"
13,12,Butters,"What are you guys talkin' about? Harleys are neato!
"
9,13,Stan,"To the moon?
"
7,10,Randy,"Get inside! Get inside!  Seniors' meeting getting out! Get off the streets! 
"
12,13,Kenny,"(Yeah, look at yourself, dude.)
"
13,14,Randy,"Stan! 
"
10,13,Cartman,"Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"And why do you think Token is a tickin' time bomb?
"
11,6,Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Goooood morning, guys!
"
6,11,Cartman,"Dude, relax.
"
15,5,Kyle,"This is it, Stan!  It's just like I designed it. There's the miniature gold course over there! And slides and uh,  excuse me, what is this place?
"
12,9,Cartman,"Eat my underwear?
"
1,9,Cartman,"What the hell is Christmas Poo?
"
18,4,Randy,"Oooo! Booom!
"
2,9,Cartman,"What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?
"
1,3,Stan,"Hey, I'm a dirty little bastard too.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Oh, there, there now. There's nothing to be afraid of, dear.) 
"
13,4,Butters,"My, my picture?
"
16,14,Cartman,"I get to be Luke Skeywalker's son. And there has to be a character called Jewbacca.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Yeah. But isn't Token the only one?
"
13,9,Butters,"I'm going!  Ohh...  Oh, hi.
"
13,5,Cartman,"What, dude, you got something?
"
11,10,Kyle,"Dude, did you finish your math homework? I kind of lost track of time last night.
"
6,7,Kyle,"It is?
"
3,1,Cartman,"Bad! Bad monkey! 
"
3,16,Kyle,"Mine neither. But I double-checked, and Cartman was right. Your period is the start of puberty.
"
8,7,Kyle,"You've been on your fucking phone since we started!
"
2,6,Stan,"W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble. 
"
14,1,Stan,"Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. 
"
9,4,Kyle,"Yeah, come on! 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Toilet paper! Cover her house in toilet paper.
"
10,1,Stan,"Dude, what are you saying??
"
8,6,Stan,"Yeah. It's just a dad and his son.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Alright, it's working!
"
8,11,Stan,"Come on, guys! 
"
14,2,Cartman,"There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Who's there?
"
12,10,Stan,"Where's dad?
"
4,1,Stan,"Yeah,. We're never gonna take you ass for granted ever again.
"
15,13,Stan,"I'm just saying there's lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked.
"
7,1,Stan,"Visitors are real. They...  Wait a minute. This has all happened before.
"
18,7,Kyle,"God damn it Cartman!
"
8,14,Stan,"This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point.
"
16,13,Stan,"You really think I went through all that trouble, lying about my wristband and claiming to be something I wasn't, for what, Kyle?! For what?!  This is a witch hunt, dude! It's all that stupid French scientist! He's the fraud, and I'm gonna prove it!
"
11,12,Stan,"Kyle!
"
1,13,Kyle,"Whoa, dude.
"
4,10,Kenny,"(What are we gonna do?)
"
10,9,Kyle,"All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11!  God-damnit!
"
6,10,Kyle,"Huh??
"
2,13,Kyle,"This ride better be good!
"
11,3,Cartman,"Guilty! I thought so! 
"
10,9,Cartman,"Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!
"
4,17,Stan,"Hey!  Wait a minute!
"
3,17,Stan,"You found what?
"
6,13,Cartman,"My God, this thing must really be powerful. 
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Aha! Caught you red-handed! Mkay!
"
10,2,Cartman,"Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!
"
13,14,Butters,"You bet!
"
4,11,Kyle,"Yeah, this church kicks a-- Eh... I-it kicks!
"
3,16,Cartman,"Buh- Don't worry. You'll get it someday. Come on, Kyle. Let's go see what kind of tampons they have here in Las Vegas. 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Jimmy, that's messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don't you remember?
"
2,17,Stan,"Whoopee!
"
9,6,Stan,"Well this time he's gone too far!
"
4,6,Butters,"Well, alright men. Here, here I come.  I'm ready to take one for the team. 
"
9,4,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
3,13,Stan,"Are you sure? He can be out here all night on the flagpole.
"
1,11,Wendy,"Noooo! Noooo!
"
7,9,Cartman,"OH, FUCK JESUS!! 
"
12,7,Kenny,"(What? Hey, let go.)
"
16,14,Cartman,"Cut the crap, Mouse! You only care about the election results because Romney would have been tougher on the Chinese!
"
12,2,Butters,"Hey, hanguh, hang on, fellas, don't you think Britney's been through enough? I mean, maybe it's finally time for us all to just leave her alone.
"
6,12,Kyle,"You're too fat to be Kenny.
"
16,14,Kyle,"It just seems so unfair. People won't ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.
"
2,12,Stan,"Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?
"
12,12,Mr. Mackey,"With an inexperienced man as President, we do know it! He is right! Game over, man! Okay?!
"
2,12,Randy,"Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it.  Well, anyway, have a nice day.
"
2,2,Kyle,"He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
"
5,9,Butters,"Well. Alright, then. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to.  Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!
"
11,5,Stan,"Mom? Dad?  Anybody home?
"
8,12,Butters,"Huh. Didn't I... Whoa, that's the darnedest thing I ever saw. 
"
10,10,Cartman,"Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!
"
17,10,Butters,"Am I just an asshole?
"
1,7,Cartman,"Hey Chef.
"
4,13,Stan,"Wow, that's amazing.
"
14,5,Stan,"Then why are you packing fudge?
"
15,9,Cartman,"Wait a minute, isn't that...
"
15,8,Kyle,"NO. I can't, Wendy.  All his negativity is starting to make me depressed. I have to let him go.  And whatever happens next, I'm going to embrace with a totally  positive attitude.
"
1,7,Cartman,"Oh look out, Holly Hobby's all pissed off! 
"
16,14,Stan,"He stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected President.
"
11,13,Stan,"I just wanna find something else to play.
"
1,4,Stan,"No thanks, I've gotta get back for the big football game. Come on boy! 
"
6,9,Kyle,"Wait. It's okay. Look, maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films. Maybe they don't even care about the free hats.
"
10,9,Kyle,"No. Way.
"
5,5,Kyle,"I got 'em! Four tickets, 68th row, to Terrance and Phillip! I waited in line since 3 this morning!
"
6,17,Stan,"God, it took forever!
"
8,9,Stan,"But you-your face!
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, good. Just step through here  And then this is your steering and here's your throttle.
"
9,10,Kyle,"She's really taking this grade seriously, Stan. I'm gonna come over so that we can take our egg to school together, all right?
"
3,4,Cartman,"After Red Racer, of course.
"
10,10,Cartman,"It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor!  Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty!
"
4,9,Cartman,"I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!
"
2,9,Kyle,"No! 
"
2,11,Cartman,"Hey, be careful, asshole!
"
2,4,Cartman,"Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Thanks.  So, what I'm thinking is, ""Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?"" 
"
4,10,Kenny,"(It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's operation-)
"
7,6,Kyle,"Hello, sir. Welcome to the Broflovski Laundromat.
"
10,8,Timmy,"Timmy!
"
14,4,Cartman,"I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
"
5,2,Butters,"Hey! Why don't we have Jimmy do some stand-up comedy? Like at our bake sale, very much?
"
2,2,Kyle,"Set an open course for the virgin sea...
"
3,5,Stan,"Oh, he'll win. Don't worry.
"
4,9,Cartman,"You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.
"
1,7,Cartman,"Nice going Kenny, she was about to give us candy.
"
17,1,Butters,"Oh my God. Oh my God they say me. They saw me and they're gonna be so angry! Maybe they didn't see me. No! No, they saw me, they see everything! I did something really bad. Really really bad. 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Butters, do you know what you're supposed to do when your penis gets hard?
"
17,8,Cartman,"Mr. Gates, I was hoping I could talk to you about the fight on Friday.
"
3,10,Randy,"Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker.  Isn't that cool?
"
10,1,Stan,"We made it!
"
18,7,Stan,"No dude, dude. We've all been here the entire time.
"
9,8,Stan,"Global warming isn't happening right now. It's, it's not what caused the Beaverton flood.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike! 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
"
2,6,Stan,"""...and after killing the entire Vietcong Army, they returned to base camp.  Once there, they rode the Devil's Drop roller coaster  and ate cotton candy. And ultimately, Ned got the Purple Heart for his courageous defense of the log ride.  So was the horror of Vietnam."" The end.
"
2,14,Cartman,"What's that?
"
2,10,Cartman,"That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!
"
2,16,Kenny,"(Okay.)
"
1,12,Kyle,"You liar, Cartman!
"
8,13,Kyle,"Just stop it!  Stoop iiit!!  There's a logical explanation for that.
"
3,2,Kyle,"I need to get a nurection for my dad.
"
6,13,Stan,"Oh crap, dude!
"
5,7,Stan,"Dude, haven't you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?
"
3,3,Cartman,"Ow!
"
16,5,Stan,"Dude, did a bully take your lunch money again?
"
13,13,Butters,"I am.
"
2,5,Stan,"But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!
"
5,1,Randy,"Really? So we can't say ***?
"
17,7,Randy,"Yeah... awesome...
"
7,4,Cartman,"Oh, okay.I guess I understand. 'I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...''I don't wanna wait for our life to be over...
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Oh yeah. Woh. 
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Uheheheheh, that's stupid.)
"
10,1,Stan,"He's remembering.
"
4,16,Kyle,"And do I have to shovel the whole driveway, or just the side the car is on?
"
3,3,Stan,"We can't fall asleep. We gotta nail that song.  You got the tape recorder, Cartman? Cartman?? 
"
9,2,Cartman,"Ah, Officer Barbrady, you're just in time. These college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival, just as I predicted.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Because it was-
"
4,3,Stan,"Okay, let's try it again. Hup!
"
11,1,Stan,"Yeah. I totally don't get it.
"
4,7,Stan,"Oh, phew.
"
9,12,Stan,"I did not! Those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they don't know the secret truth.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Well, Mom, Dad, I guess I'd better be going. The concert is gonna start soon.
"
7,6,Butters,"Well how do I make semen... come out of my body?
"
13,14,Stan,"...Well, not everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom.
"
5,13,Stan,"I think I understand.
"
10,4,Cartman,"Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls!  Kyle!  Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle!  Okay... Okay! Okay okay!  You win! You win. I give up.  Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. 
"
7,11,Butters,"Wow, that's gonna be so fun!
"
6,7,Butters,"They did that on the Simpsons! Ha! Treehouse of Horror! Episode 4F02! The Genesis tub. Lisa loses a tooth, and the bacteria on it start to grow, and makes a little society, and they build a statue of her thinking she's God! Ha! Hahaha!
"
5,13,Kyle,"Wait. Kenny's going to die?
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"Kids, everyone together. Welcome to Pioneer Village. This is a recreation of early Colorado days. I want you all to meet Pioneer Paul. 
"
1,8,Cartman,"Sweet. 
"
2,7,Stan,"Oh no! 
"
1,11,Cartman,"My mom said if you want to become a lesbian you have to lick carpet.
"
14,10,Randy,"What?!
"
4,6,Cartman,"Mister Hammerhead?
"
9,5,Butters,"Well yeah, but... we usually win.
"
1,6,Mr. Garrison,"What, what do you mean?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion.  Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!
"
15,12,Kyle,"Shut the hell up, Cartman!
"
2,17,Cartman,"No...more...coffee. Blech. 
"
18,8,Cartman,"OOHHH!! 
"
16,8,Stan,"This game is stupid. I have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as I can to the other team!
"
18,7,Butters,"Ah, okay uh, I think I'm done, Eric. Ah I'm feeling kind of dizzy and uh- 
"
7,6,Stan,"Yes it is!
"
17,8,Kenny,"Previously, on South Park.
"
11,1,Stan,"He told my dad he was...
"
17,9,Stan,"Alright, guys, here's the deal: the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers. The kids who want XBoxes plan to flank from the left, here.  Our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the mall's back entrance, here. 
"
1,12,Cartman,"Eeyy! Give me that back!
"
5,10,Butters,"Aw gee, thah-at sounds swell, fellas, but I can't go 'cause I'm still havin' behavioral problems.
"
4,2,Timmy,"Hu-aah!
"
12,8,Cartman,"Because we're going to make them think... we're one of them.  Here, put these teeth in!  And just say ""herro"" and ""prease"" a lot.  ""Oh, herro prease."" Ping pong ching chong.
"
15,8,Stan,"No, I'm done with that! 
"
5,1,Kyle,"Well! I hope it lived up to all the hype! You must feel so much better now!
"
2,8,Kyle,"We wanna buy M-80s.
"
6,5,Butters,"Yeah. 
"
1,6,Kyle,"Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all.
"
4,7,Stan,"Cartman, we have to ask you a question. A very serious question.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih, Timmih Timmih Timmih.  Timmih Timmih Timmih Timmih, Timmih Timmih Timmih.  Aaaaah.
"
13,9,Butters,"Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch.
"
3,10,Stan,"You didn't know that?
"
13,6,Randy,"Yeah, it doesn't look like the space cash was ever here.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Uh...
"
2,5,Kyle,"Get him, Frenchy!
"
3,3,Stan,"Bitch.
"
8,12,Wendy,"That's okay, you guys. 
"
10,1,Kyle,"Draw two card, fatass.
"
3,2,Cartman,"Either I'm Jesus, or else, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
2,18,Kyle,"Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
"
14,10,Stan,"Yeah, alright.
"
14,5,Kyle,"There doesn't have to be...
"
1,8,Mr. Garrison,"Children, children! I'm a little disappointed in your Thanksgiving spirit. Only a few cans have been donated to our canned food drive.  And can't we do a little better than ... Creamed Corn ... uh ... Creamed Corn ... and ... Creamed Corn?  Please bring in more diverse food children or else Kenny's family is going to have a pretty corny Thanksgiving.  Corny...Gravy...Corny Thanksgiving, hoo. Hahhaa. Anyway children, I understand a few of you have brought in something special for show-and-tell.
"
10,2,Randy,"Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars.
"
6,1,Stan,"We've gotta hurry this up. 
"
6,11,Randy,"Sweetheart, you saw the news...
"
14,2,Butters,"Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
"
10,1,Kyle,"Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club.
"
6,7,Cartman,"...So?
"
14,9,Randy,"People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. 
"
1,11,Stan,"Bluuch. 
"
18,5,Butters,"...Okay.
"
3,15,Kyle,"Dad? 
"
15,10,Cartman,"Okay, no, they all did awesome! In fact our students did so good on the tests that you...  you decided to reward them all. At lunch you're serving the students pizza from Pizza Hut! But we're going to put laxatives and Arby's horsey sauce in the pizza so that every kid in the school craps their pants after recess. Everyone craps their pants, nobody's singled out, problem solved. 
"
7,5,Kyle,"No way.
"
3,5,Cartman,"I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it.
"
14,3,Cartman,"KFC!! 
"
3,13,Randy,"Alright, alright, that's enough, boys. 
"
6,17,Jimmy,"Six geese are laying... fu...five go-oldenh ...uhrings. Fodom... dom... du...du...t...du... Four calling biiirds
"
8,11,Cartman,"...I think bail.
"
9,8,Randy,"I'll help you, Sharon.  Boy, that's just awful.
"
5,6,Kyle,"That's the most horrible story I've ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?
"
8,11,Cartman,"Oh dude, I just got the best idea
"
9,3,Cartman,"Aw man, that's too bad, Token. Hey, could you bring us some more bread, huh? Oh and some more olive oil. Chop chop! 
"
15,4,Stan,"Yeah. That's good. A little higher on Craig's side.  Yeup. 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us.
"
2,18,Kyle,"That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!
"
10,14,Stan,"...Yeah?
"
9,12,Stan,"What?
"
14,2,Stan,"There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih! '
"
2,2,Cartman,"Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me-hee
"
17,9,Kyle,"Dude, I know you're pissed at me right now. You've gotta understand that I did it because I know in my heart that the XBox is better, for all of us.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir.
"
16,5,Stan,"I guess, there's only one thing left for me to do.
"
7,11,Stan,"Dude, I wonder where Kyle is.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Oh, you're just saying that because he brings you candy.
"
1,2,Cartman,"Beefcake!
"
5,7,Wendy,"Yeah. Thank God.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?
"
4,10,Butters,"Uhwell, uh what about the handicapped kid, uh-Timmy?
"
8,13,Kyle,"Hey, uh, does anyone know who that guy is?!
"
11,10,Jimmy,"Sucking Cartman's b-balls.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Tiiimm-mmah!!!!!
"
11,6,Cartman,"Crap! 
"
4,16,Cartman,"Something about a swimsuit - I don't remember, but you definitely answer ""bad touch.""
"
7,14,Kyle,"Okay, it's third down. And now, somebody make a play!
"
8,5,Cartman,"The New Orleans Saints. 
"
5,1,Stan,"All the world destroyed?
"
5,10,Cartman,"A-heh, what?
"
6,7,Stan,"This is it.
"
14,7,Kyle,"When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Just give me back my money...
"
4,7,Cartman,"Uh huh.
"
10,14,Stan,"It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. 
"
14,7,Butters,"Towelie, I gotta take you somewhere really important!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Sweet, now I can just play with myself.  Pewpeww-pewww! Get back in the shuttlecraft! 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"But... but why do they hate each other?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Kyle?
"
11,10,Kyle,"This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story.
"
14,2,Cartman,"Oh really? Sweet.
"
1,11,Stan,"I can't wait for Ms. Ellen to see what a raging lesbian I am.
"
6,5,Cartman,"These commercials are all so God-damn stupid!
"
10,12,Kyle,"Will you shut up already?! 
"
11,7,Stan,"I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on.
"
11,14,Kyle,"I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Uh oh! 
"
3,9,Kyle,"Kenny will find a way.
"
5,14,Butters,"Hi Dad! 
"
2,4,Kyle,"Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
"
2,8,Cartman,"I am not swimming around in pee!
"
14,7,Butters,"Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways.
"
14,8,Stan,"Cartman, tell us.
"
3,15,Cartman,"that's why they're lame.
"
7,15,Stan,"Whoa whoa, Cartman.
"
18,3,Randy,"Yeah. I don't understand you at all. A lot you know. 
"
4,17,Stan,"Uuhh, E. W-EE wish you a Merry Christmas. 
"
1,7,Kyle,"See Cartman, your mom is on the cover.
"
6,6,Butters,"Why yes, I did. But he pushed me down and I scraped my elbow.  Go on and look at it. It's scraped. Look.  Yeesss. Go on and see the red mark on my elbow, the red mark I made myself to throw you off Professor Chaos's trail.
"
4,12,Kenny,"(Yes, sir!)
"
16,2,Kyle,"Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!
"
9,4,Stan,"Now that Cartman got Kenny's feeding tube out, he's gonna die for sure! 
"
12,8,Butters,"Well okay, I'm sorry!
"
1,1,Cartman,"Yeah, go home you little dildo.
"
12,4,Kyle,"We have to speed this up!  Uh, can we collect our Internet money in front of you, please?
"
3,1,Kenny,"(That's not good?)
"
10,13,Cartman,"Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!
"
18,2,Randy,"Hamburger Helper?
"
9,2,Cartman,"Listen, you're my friends, but if you've been compromised, I'll have no problem taking you out! I'll expect the same from you. 
"
14,1,Butters,"I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?
"
2,2,Cartman,"They can't. Mephesto can't die.
"
9,4,Cartman,"Who cares? Kenny's dead!  When do I take possession of my PSP, sir?
"
12,10,Randy,"All right, here we are. Marsh family gathered for another dinner. 
"
4,4,Stan,"Dude, it's Timmy.
"
8,3,Kyle,"I saw The Passion!
"
2,5,Kyle,"Agghh!
"
16,6,Cartman,"It's diet, dude. Diet soda doesn't give you diarrhea. 
"
6,14,Kyle,"Aaaa! 
"
2,11,Cartman,"God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!
"
6,12,Kyle,"Hey Kenny.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Oh. Let me get out my notepad so I can classify this new species.  Well, this should be fine, just fine. Just fine, fine.
"
11,11,Cartman,"Well we're here now, that's all that matters.  Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Thanks a lot, fellas. Well, we gotta get down to the training center and start working out. Word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year.
"
2,10,Stan,"Catch what?
"
4,8,Wendy,"Oh man, we've got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument.
"
13,14,Butters,"Do you need to wash your hands?
"
1,12,Kyle,"That was cool!
"
5,13,Kenny,"(No. Fuckin' Madonna...) 
"
6,6,Butters,"Yeh, you didn't? 
"
2,3,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed--
"
11,5,Stan,"What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross?  It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times?  Answer me!
"
5,3,Kyle,"Congratulations, sister. You have heard the noble truth and are now a Blaintologist.
"
13,10,Butters,"Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad.
"
10,11,Kyle,"You're afraid to do it, too.
"
7,4,Randy,"And me, I'll be the caring soul.
"
4,1,Stan,"Hi. Can Token come out and play?
"
1,9,Kyle,"Hey!  How about you come to school with me tomorrow, so I can at least prove I'm not crazy to my friends.
"
9,9,Butters,"Then I can go home and tell my mommy and daddy I'm not really dead?
"
6,13,Cartman,"We're screwed.
"
6,16,Stan,"Cartman??
"
16,9,Stan,"Dude! Dude, not cool!
"
2,14,Kyle,"Are you Elton John?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Alright, Cartman, joke's over. 
"
3,13,Randy,"Well, something. I mean, you can't just wait until she's a teenager and expect her to figure out everything all at once.
"
7,9,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
9,5,Randy,"This is America! This is an honest America!
"
3,2,Stan,"That's amazing!
"
18,9,Stan,"I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
18,10,Cartman,"Oho, looks like we've reached customer service, brahs. Now we can truly be everywhere!
"
13,14,Butters,"What's this?
"
6,3,Butters,"What?
"
11,10,Cartman,"I've got unfinished business. You go through life being told there's justice, then you learn that the only real justice...  is the justice you take.  Make no mistake, Kyle. Before this is over, you will suck my balls. 
"
9,2,Kyle,"We can't. Kenny just checked. There's a wall of people like seven miles thick behind us.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Hi. My name's Kyle. Uh, I understand that your country flies people into space for money.
"
15,13,Stan,"Dude, it is called History Channel.
"
14,11,Cartman,"Asshoooles! 
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"Everyone, let's give K. C. and his weed a big hand.  Okay Kyle, we're ready to see your science project.
"
4,4,Cartman,"Hoo-ray.
"
18,6,Randy,"Stan, just because I make a good living with my music doesn't mean you can go blow it all on Canadough!
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Well he was technically standing his ground, Token.
"
15,7,Stan,"Oh cool, Legos. Thanks, Butters.
"
2,18,Cartman,"He might have been, by crikey.
"
14,5,Mr. Mackey,"But even if it were safe for Muhammad to be shown, how would we ever find him?
"
10,10,Cartman,"Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg.
"
5,13,Kenny,"(I hope so)
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"Oh Jesus! Hey! It isn't safe in there!  Get out of there!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology.
"
18,7,Butters,"Ah how do you know that?!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Huh, I think God has plenty of money.
"
14,6,Kyle,"Aw crap.
"
7,3,Stan,"Tomorrow in school we'll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do.  And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you'll do the same! 
"
8,4,Randy,"What's the matter with him?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Dude, um, what are doing after school, Token? You wanna, you wanna hang out? 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Son of a ...b-bitch!  Taxi!  Follow that pimp and ho! 
"
18,3,Mr. Garrison,"Actually,  it's more like a royal flush.
"
7,6,Cartman,"The you'd better get that semen sample no matter how long it takes!
"
10,10,Kyle,"I need you to keep quiet about this, all right?  My little brother and his tea-
"
1,3,Cartman,"Hey, it might be!
"
12,9,Cartman,"That's not true. You're just saying that.
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well, good for you, Puppet Pants! I'll have nothin' to do with it!
"
15,13,Cartman,"Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Sweet. What is it?
"
1,13,Cartman,"Oh, fine. How are you guys?
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you're next.
"
9,5,Kyle,"I know who.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Dude, I want wings!  Ahghgh!!!  Oh Jesus, it's only you!
"
6,5,Cartman,"This TV is great, Chef.
"
3,14,Kyle,"We'll give you 10 bucks.
"
12,9,Butters,"Hehehe yeah, did you come up with that one on your own?!
"
7,8,Stan,"Oh my God, you guys are not gonna believe what happened to me last night.
"
8,4,Randy,"Uh, hey, ex- excuse me.
"
2,9,Stan,"If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!
"
12,10,Kyle,"Two hundred dollars?
"
5,7,Stan,"Why?! What's the big deal?!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. 
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Uh this is Cher. This is her new album.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I know! I wanna know why not?!
"
6,6,Jimmy,"Hey fellas. I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to s-gif- gift basket.
"
2,7,Kyle,"There.  I think we got it.
"
9,2,Cartman,"I'm talking about the end of all life as we know it.  For the past several days I've been... noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town.  At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence.  Then I saw this...  Three new drum circles have sprouted up here, here, and here. They're all growing in diameter, at a rate of two hippies per hour. What this means... is that the hippies are conglomerating. They're thriving, if you will. I think that they're setting up for a... . hippie music festival.
"
16,12,Randy,"Stan, get off the damned phone! People are gonna start callin' to reserve movies! Gau! 
"
5,7,Cartman,"That's what it's called when you milk a dog: beating it off.  Don't you guys know anything?
"
10,9,Cartman,"Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?
"
3,4,Stan,"Yeah. He's all pissed off at you. So, will you fight?
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"Tonight I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the-
"
3,16,Stan,"Who-o-oa, du-ude. I've got boobs.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Yes, I have it right hmya. 
"
10,10,Kyle,"Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson.
"
18,1,Kyle,"Bloody butt cough.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Next Saturday?? I'll never be able to keep Butters in the...  In the... depths of my heart for that long. I sure hope he... turns up before then.
"
1,5,Kenny,"(""And I want to see you handling your breasts."")
"
6,14,Cartman,"Aw man, this is awesome! 
"
4,15,Kenny,"(Yeah. Am I?)
"
10,9,Butters,"Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush.
"
13,4,Stan,"What?! No way Wendy, today's the day!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I will bet you ten bucks that if I start a Christian rock band that I can get a platinum album before you guys do!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Oh Jesus!  You gonna start running your mouth off again?  P-push it! Push it!
"
14,4,Stan,"Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
"
7,1,Kenny,"(Awesome)
"
17,10,Butters,"No way! Go back to Annie Nelson! She's built like a Slim Jim! 
"
6,16,Cartman,"Your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place.
"
10,13,Cartman,"What?
"
4,12,Cartman,"...What?
"
13,8,Kyle,"Ike! Ike, what?!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
Oh wicky wicky Wild West!
Shelly, guess who's busted!  Hey! I said, guess who's busted!  Eh, you're not gonna trick me, I've got the goods on you!
"
6,10,Stan,"Sure thing, Bebe.
"
14,7,Jimmy,"So I made up my mind that I've just got to find the Tardicaca girl I did adore.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Noohoho! Peter Panda nooo!
"
8,11,Cartman,"One testicle!  What an asshole! 
"
3,3,Cartman,"But mo-om! I have to tell Chef that he's marrying a succubuuus!
"
5,8,Stan,"Hey yeah.  Well guys, let's go to the swimming pool!  Aaah. Let's go take a shower!  Let's go waterskiing!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here.  Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me.  Is anybody coming?
"
8,9,Cartman,"Sir, don't you think you're talking a little too much?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Haahaahahaha!  Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!
"
2,15,Stan,"Yeah, my goldfish-.
"
6,9,Stan,"What?
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, the student body president really doesn't have the kind of power that you-
"
8,7,Stan,"Hello, Mrs. Landis. Would you like snow-shoveling service again today?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Come on, we gotta get to work on some songs! 
"
6,17,Cartman,"Poo Poo Train is my favorite thing, spreading Christmas joy as we ride and sing!
"
11,4,Kyle,"No! ...Not... not like you're saying.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hahahahahaaaha! Hahahahahaaaha! Hahaha, Hahaha, Hahahahahahaha!
"
1,5,Kyle,"Rotten, they're both really drunk, but the won't have sex.
"
3,3,Stan,"Here it goes.
"
18,5,Butters,"Be careful! The powerlines!
"
6,13,Stan,"No, we have to return it! 
"
3,13,Kyle,"I can't. I have to wait for Rebecca to show up.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Yeah, see, the problem is, Mom, is that with Kenny gone I'm now the poorest kids in skewl!
"
4,12,Mr. Mackey,"We... don't like to talk about it.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Okay, okay. Even if there was a Jewpacabra, it wouldn't know I was the one who got video of it, huh? How could it know that? It couldn't know that, right? Kyle? 
"
11,14,Kyle,"Stan, what is going on?!
"
15,11,Randy,"Okay. What's Shelly doing?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Yeah, that was kewl huh?
"
12,12,Randy,"Here comes the change everybody! WOOO! 
"
1,2,Wendy,"He's got a gun!
"
2,7,Mr. Garrison,"Come on you little bitch. 
"
2,6,Stan,"W-we're sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We're sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.
"
7,11,Cartman,"So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn't matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we've also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn't make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.
"
6,16,Stan,"Yes?
"
8,1,Butters,"But, but fellas, if I, if I dress up like a dog with a star in my eye, I- I'm gonna get grounded.
"
1,8,Stan,"Hello? No, no, it's a ma- Vas-deferens?
"
14,7,Jimmy,"We get to see all our old friends again. Hey, there's Frances. Hey Frances!
"
5,6,Cartman,"But I don't have any cash. I spent everything on this park.
"
7,6,Kyle,"...Grrrr!!! 
"
18,3,Randy,"Aaah I don't know. Why?
"
1,8,Cartman,"I'm seriously getting pissed off over here!!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Yes I will!
"
15,12,Jimmy,"But if he's 1% of 17%, then he's .17%.
"
18,6,Jimmy,"It's a figure of speech with crippled people. We'd say we lost an arm and a leg, but they ain't worth much.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"What?!
"
4,10,Stan,"We're goin' to church. We've sinned and so we have to confess again.
"
17,5,Kyle,"He doesn't even let me near him!
"
6,3,Butters,"Never.  Sir, I really gotta go home. My parents are gonna be sore at me.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Dude, this thing is huge. And it doesn't hurt the crack babies at all. We're swimming in cash, Kyle. Let me take you out to Denny's. It's Baconalia time.
"
3,10,Randy,"Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!
"
3,9,Kenny,"(I'm telling you, it's Kyle you want. He's the one who tried to get me in here, and you know it.)
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"No, I... think all my work here is done. Dad, I... don't know what to say; I feel closer to you than I ever have.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Okay. Okay Wendy. I will eat my underwear. Right here, right now.
"
10,6,Stan,"NO.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Nobody likes Jimmy Buffett except for frat boys and alcoholic chicks from the South!
"
13,4,Randy,"What was that?
"
8,11,Kyle,"Yeah. Maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week, they'll let us stay on the air!
"
5,2,Cartman,"Man, this guy sucks.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Nothin' Na- Due-nothing. 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Kick ass! 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters, I'm seriously! Are you fucking with me?!
"
12,13,Kyle,"What happened? I thought you were gonna kill yourself.
"
9,13,Stan,"Craig, Token, get the slings ready. 
"
1,3,Kyle,"Wow, that'd be cool.
"
2,7,Cartman,"This kicks ass, you guys! John Elway is my father! 
My father is John Elway, my father is John Elway
Deedun, Deedun.
"
13,10,Stan,"And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Then that's it. I'm... I'm never going to get my brother back. 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Okay, nice, Butters. Uhhm, now go to the front door and ring the doorbell. This is the part where you collect the money.
"
8,6,Stan,"You just gotta pretend you're Blanket until we can get the real Blanket somewhere safe.
"
6,12,Stan,"Hold on to this, Cartman. I might lose it. 
"
1,5,Kenny,"(Look at that!  What's he doin'?)
"
14,4,Kyle,"Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it.
"
14,2,Stan,"What?
"
1,12,Cartman,"Eechh! Screw you, hippie! Eeeh-eh.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Well, how'd we do it last time??
"
18,5,Cartman,"This thing is recording, right?
"
6,5,Kyle,"It's the biggest night of the year.
"
6,8,Randy,"Waaah! Waaah!  Uyah  ahem. 'Scuse me.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh yeah, keep doing that. That's working good.
"
16,3,Butters,"Oh, that's okay. I think...
"
6,17,Stan,"RPG, four o'clock!
"
4,1,Kyle,"Oh no! The girls are gonna win!
"
7,13,Stan,"...Whoops.
"
2,16,Cartman,"I don't wanna take care of Cousin Elvin!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Boinsure li bonsure.
"
5,7,Stan,"Oh no, what now?
"
16,10,Cartman,"Isn't it possible your mom was raped by the UPS man? We know nothing about this guy and he shows up to all of our houses. Think about it: what kind of sane, normal person would wanna have sex with Kyle's mom?
"
18,8,Stan,"Hell yeah! 
"
16,3,Stan,"You will like this, Kenny. Pull down your pants. 
"
12,7,Cartman,"I wanna shoot an Indian.
"
1,10,Stan,"Whoa, dude! 
"
2,9,Stan,"When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
"
10,12,Butters,"Well, like what?
"
4,10,Butters,"Hey, there's a window in the back that's usually open. 
"
18,1,Cartman,"Well, what are you gonna do? Go back to school? I'm not going back there, man!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Come... back. 
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Kathie Lee Gifford. I don't believe it.
"
13,4,Kyle,"Calm down Butters! The men are taking action. But we need to take your picture.
"
18,1,Stan,"Whooping Fart Balls.
"
9,14,Cartman,"Why?
"
16,14,Butters,"He didn't tell me nothin'. Annd I'm sworn to secrecy. Ih-it's really important, Kyle, and it isn't what you think.  Uh, don't make me say any more!
"
6,5,Cartman,"Oh my god, eugh! Oh God! Oh, Jesus help me!  Oh! I lost a doughnut!  Oooh! Oh oh!  Oh my God!  Leave no doughnut behind!
"
12,1,Kyle,"I'm sorry. I'm. I'm really. Cartman, I f-I feel really bad for you. Honestly.
"
3,14,Randy,"All I'm saying is that... is that the Confederates would have just gotten their asses kicked in Topeka!
"
2,16,Kyle,"You're not the real Mr. Hankey.
"
12,11,Cartman,"Looks like the... pan flute music is driving away giant... guinea pigs?
"
17,10,Wendy,"Oh good. Lisa Berger told on you? Good!
"
5,13,Kenny,"(I'm okay, I guess.)
"
13,12,Stan,"God! Shut up!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
17,10,Wendy,"I want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other. This is Lisa Berger's class photo, right?
"
17,8,Stan,"The Princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose.
"
12,3,Kyle,"You can get high from choking yourself? 
"
18,10,Stan,"Because my dad's an idiot!
"
11,7,Stan,"Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!
"
9,11,Jimmy,"Yeah. Go on, beat it, re... rr-retard! 
"
5,3,Stan,"Who are you?
"
15,5,Kyle,"What?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Good night, Ms. Lopez. Tomorrow is gonna be a great day. Great day tomorrow...  Tomorrow...  ""Kyle, you were wrong! We did do a record deal!""  ""You were wrong, Kyle!""  ""Nananananaaana!""  ""Hahahahahaaaha!""  ""Nananananaaana!"" ""Hahahahahaaaha!""  Awesommme. Yeeessss.
"
2,11,Stan,"Oh.
"
14,1,Butters,"Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again!  I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips.
"
15,10,Kyle,"What the hell happened?!
"
8,12,Wendy,"Hey, Bebe. I heard you were having a party tonight.
"
6,17,Cartman,"...and here's some old toys that I don't need anymore.  And here! Here's some Christmas cookies!  And some holly and mistletoe!  Oh, this'll the happiest Christmas the Middle East has ever seen! Guys, get those lights down from the door. We'll give them to the needy Iraqis, too.
"
4,6,Kyle,"How?
"
16,5,Butters,"Naw, I'm not no Anonymous Andy.
"
2,4,Stan,"We know, we know, that's what everybody says.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yummy yummy yummy I want Cartman's farts in my tummy.
"
17,7,Cartman,"You can't change his mind, Sir Kyle. Sony people don't think with logic. He betrayed us. And now we must out-Game of Thrones him by making powerful alliances.
"
7,5,Mr. Mackey,"Here she comes! Here she comes!
"
14,6,Stan,"Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back.
"
13,6,Randy,"Uh hey, space officers. How can we help you?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"That was a brilliant idea, having me put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave.  Now we'll get fired for sure!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Hm. I don't really see the irony in that, Kyle. 
"
2,17,Stan,"What?
"
7,3,Cartman,"Yeah? Well, Ol' Mrs. Streible probably had it comin' to her.
"
8,5,Butters,"Oh boy! My robot gets to come with me to see Aunt Nellie?!
"
17,1,Cartman,"Yeah, it's that kid Kyle again. He's a total boner, always listening in on my calls.
"
12,1,Kyle,"I do. 
"
8,5,Butters,"Oh. Yeah.
"
11,13,Kyle,"Oh, okay. Cool. 
"
13,7,Cartman,"We take to the African sea!
We'll brave the squalls and bust your balls
Somalian pirates we!
"
6,15,Cartman,"Ahh, Aahhhh! 
"
2,6,Cartman,"I'm ready, Steven Spielberg! 
"
7,9,Cartman,"Inspiration. Wait a minute,  that's it. Inspiration, you guys. Don't you see?
"
15,6,Butters,"You can count on Postman Butters!  Special delivery, ma'am.  Here you are, sir.  Brand new sushi restaurant in town.  A flyer for you, from Postman Butters! 
"
10,8,Stan,"Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us.
"
1,11,Cartman,"Memememememe, me!
"
3,13,Cartman,"Wwaargh. Not right now, Mom. 
"
13,10,Stan,"We'll see about that!
"
6,16,Stan,"Mom, Dad, I don't think that guy is from the future. 
"
3,11,Stan,"They're shooting at us.
"
14,14,Randy,"Oh my God that's awesome! Oh...  Oh, oh.  ...Yeah. Whoa.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face. 
"
11,5,Stan,"They found me!
"
15,5,Cartman,"Egh, to things we need to keep the office running, Kyle. Here, look. 
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Kyle, please try your best. It seems pretty important.  This.. boy... uhkay... is Jew. Uhkay? Jew... like you. Uhkay? Please... uh, please try... speak... to Jew.
"
9,8,Stan,"We have to find a way out! 
"
1,9,Stan,"I wish Kyle was here.  It just doesn't seem right without him.
"
2,3,Kenny,"(Hi, Cartman.)
"
3,15,Kyle,"Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Dude, why is your store called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?""
"
2,12,Stan,"Truth or Dare? Wow.  Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do.
"
17,10,Butters,"And I said no? Oh man, I gotta upload this  and then go buy her some flowers and then go tell her I love her. 
"
6,3,Cartman,"Oh YES!! 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Yeah? 
"
1,11,Wendy,"Kaqemblaq! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"The cannibals! Don't you know? The meteor destroyed all of society, Butters. Now Earth is ruled by packs of wild humans gone mad! Those of us who survived are now being hunted by flesh-starved cannibals!
"
4,10,Randy,"Well, that was quite an uplifting sermon.
"
3,14,Stan,"That's it, Cartman, you can't be the drummer!
"
5,3,Kyle,"Stan!
"
10,9,Kyle,"Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. 
"
4,8,Wendy,"Hey, that's a pretty good point, Cartman.
"
14,1,Kyle,"Oh God, it's true.
"
7,3,Stan,"Cartman, we're confessing tomorrow in school, and that's final.
"
5,7,Cartman,"Yeah, just hold on a minute. The fifth graders showed us how to do it.  Red rocket. Come on, dog, red rocket!  Ohooohhh!
"
2,13,Stan,"Cool. 
"
3,14,Stan,"Aw, damnit!
"
3,14,Randy,"Not now, uh Stan, I'm pillaging.  Get over here!
"
6,7,Cartman,"Me?  I'm gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men.
"
11,14,Cartman,"Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?
"
18,9,Kyle,"Let's Plays?
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"T is for ""time to leave,"" cashchucker!
"
14,2,Kyle,"Yeah, sweet.
"
11,14,Stan,"Wendy! 
"
6,2,Stan,"I'll be there, you queen!
"
9,14,Randy,"Everybody just stay calm! I can handle this, no problem. I know how to deal. 
"
11,12,Cartman,"Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Why don't we just raise our bet to ten dollars?!
"
10,2,Stan,"Oh hey Kyle.
"
6,7,Butters,"Aaah! Nooo! 
"
1,3,Stan,"Cartman, you suck at telling scary stories.
"
17,9,Kyle,"Ok-okay.  Stan? Stan?
"
7,1,Cartman,"What are you doing, man?! 
"
3,8,Randy,"Hey, did you see Principal Victoria in there? She looks hot.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Step on it, Mr. Worf! 
"
9,14,Randy,"Oh yeah, I'll be fine. I got some beers to keep my buzz going.
"
10,7,Mr. Mackey,"Mrs. Cartman, I know this is extremely difficult but, there is help out there for people like you. Have you ever heard of a show called Nanny 911?
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"What? We can't find anybody to fill in for you. Why can't you go to Arkansas?
"
8,10,Stan,"Dude, let's play Fireman.
"
3,10,Stan,"You like it?
"
9,14,Randy,"No??
"
14,4,Kyle,"What? Why?
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"What did you say?!
"
11,11,Butters,"Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it.
"
5,5,Kyle,"I didn't see he wouldn't be there, either. Look, all we have to do is get them there, right? Once Terrance and Phillip get together again, it'll be like old times.
"
16,14,Kyle,"What?  You mean the missile defense program?!  Butters, where's Cartman supposed to hand over the ballots?!
"
4,14,Kyle,"Dude, it just can't be better than ours. It just can't be.
"
11,9,Randy,"I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter.  I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!
"
15,7,Stan,"Yeah it sucks. All my friends are sick with the flu.
"
10,3,Kyle,"But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.
"
17,3,Cartman,"I'm going to flush out Patient Zero. And you're gonna shoot him. It's the only way.
"
13,4,Cartman,"We got you a present, Butters. I'll put it here on your nightstand 'cause none of us want to touch you since you got queefed on.
"
13,9,Butters,"I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
"
5,9,Kyle,"Dude, my mom won't even let me have a hamster.
"
16,12,Randy,"Sharon, it was $10,000 for the entire place! It wasn't gonna last! Don't worry, we'll make the money back in a week. Guaranteed. You excited, Stan?
"
1,12,Stan,"Good-bye, Robert Smith!
"
5,1,Kyle,"Ungh, it said in my book that the word, ""shit"", started exactly the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"".
"
16,2,Kyle,"Nuh uh! It's ""Whoever denied it, supplied it!""
"
12,8,Butters,"Hey, Eric, uh these people aren't Chinese.
"
15,8,Cartman,"Everything alright here, Kyle?
"
6,6,Cartman,"...Yeah, I've only seen that kid in class, but he never does anything. He's more like a prop. 
"
2,5,Stan,"Chef, we're hungry.
"
10,4,Cartman,"This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.
"
18,9,Kyle,"Ike, that is enough! If you're interested in Call of Duty, go play it downstairs in the living room!
"
7,11,Stan,"I knew he'd turn up.
"
15,6,Butters,"That does it, you hear me?! I am through with all of you! No more Postman Butters, No more Inspector Butters, no more Porn Star Butters, no more Professor Chaos, and no more-  Waaahh! 
"
1,6,Cartman,"Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?
"
3,12,Stan,"Who was that?
"
8,14,Kyle,"Dude, why do you care?!
"
1,2,Cartman,"This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcake!
"
13,10,Cartman,"My man can do whatever he wants.
"
1,6,Stan,"Quick, jump through the window.
"
10,4,Cartman,"I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!
"
7,15,Kyle,"What?
"
18,2,Mr. Mackey,"Then eat it!
"
3,14,Kyle,"We'll never stop them now.
"
3,10,Randy,"Well, I guess that settles that.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Oh, hi. Is Chef here? We have to talk to him.
"
2,16,Kyle,"Please stop.
"
1,2,Cartman,"If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?
"
11,14,Kyle,"No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!
"
8,5,Cartman,"AWESOM-O needs to rest! Feeling faint.
"
14,5,Randy,"We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages...
"
1,13,Stan,"Huh?  Oh yeah.
"
3,14,Kyle,"What do we do?!
"
6,1,Stan,"Oh, dude, look!  It's that commercial with the guy that lost 400 pounds eating at Subway Sandwiches!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!
"
15,7,Stan,"They both look the same. 
"
18,9,Randy,"Can't help it, Nick. Can't help feeling like... we're losing something.
"
4,13,Kyle,"I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
"
11,13,Stan,"You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad! 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Tim-mih.
"
10,6,Randy,"Uhh, Stan?
"
6,14,Stan,"Oh, no, no, no no no no.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Did you eat too many pork rinds last night? 
"
7,6,Kenny,"(Aw, now don't say that. Poor little kid.)
"
17,2,Randy,"Look, we were told that you were available for hire and we're desperate!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Uh, yeah! I agree! Uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didn't know how to deal with what I was seeing. C-Cartman should be punished!
"
15,13,Cartman,"Tell me you've already got everything we need for Thanksgiving!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Ahb. A fireman and a p-p-Polack are eating marshmallows when-
"
7,6,Cartman,"Well, keep tryin', Butters.
"
6,12,Kyle,"We know he's dead. We mean, where is his body??
"
1,1,Cartman,"That's what I said.
"
9,6,Kyle,"You can't believe it?? He does this shit all the time!
"
18,9,Kyle,"Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a little guy in a window on the screen. Someone who just comments on stuff. I mean, really? Who would even WANT to do that?! 
"
15,8,Kyle,"That's only a vaccination for girls, stupid!
"
7,11,Cartman,"We're on our way to Casa Bonita! We're gonna be there very soon. You're gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there's this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.
"
14,6,Mr. Garrison,"All I can tell you, Eric, is that we were all told to stick to the story, to protect someone very important. I can't say more, I won't. But I'll... I'll tell you who has the answer.
"
6,16,Stan,"Our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong, and they're never gonna change! 
"
9,9,Cartman,"Because I do, Clyde.
"
7,10,Randy,"Whoa-ho-ho-ooh, what happened? Is it over?
"
6,5,Stan,"We made it.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Ooooohh.
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
2,2,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next.
"
6,3,Stan,"Kenny woulda done it. 
"
16,12,Randy,"Can you believe it? Completely turnkey!  Yo got your sci-fi, comedies, buddy flicks, chick flicks, all on Blu-ray or DVD!  Well, what do you think?
"
18,10,Cartman,"He's such a douchebag.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Really? M-maybe I can catch the bus ...and get down there before the talent show ends. Th-thanks, Officer Barbrady! 
"
9,5,Randy,"Hey Bat Dad!  I didn't hear no bell.
"
9,12,Stan,"I, I guess.
"
10,9,Cartman,"That's right, Butters.
"
5,11,Kyle,"It seems like I might get splinters, though.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"How much would this cost me?
"
14,4,Stan,"Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
"
15,1,Kyle,"Dad! You tasered my dad!
"
2,16,Kyle,"Behold! Here's your false prophet!
"
10,1,Kenny,"(Yeah, me too.)
"
2,12,Stan,"' G'oh?
"
8,7,Randy,"We're doing the only thing we can do. If our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come, then we have to take matters into our own hands.  We're trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans! Present-day America Number One!
"
8,11,Kyle,"We're making the news more appealing to students.
"
14,9,Kyle,"Shut the fuck up!  What?
"
5,13,Cartman,"Great, just sign right here, please.  Hi. Havin' an abortion today?  Great.  Listen, if you'd like to sell your abortion for research I'm offering uh, seventy-five dollars. Help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there.  And you sign right here.  Uh excuse me, ma'am. Can I interest you in selling your aborted fetus? 
"
12,12,Stan,"Let go of my face, asshole!
"
10,8,Stan,"15 agility.
"
7,13,Mr. Mackey,"Boys, what are you doing back here?  I asked you a question: What are you doing back here, 'k?!
"
9,8,Randy,"My colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests, but... we believe it may happen... the day after tomorrow. 
"
17,9,Randy,"Get back! Get out of my way!  Commander Marsh?
"
10,14,Stan,"All right, guys, listen.  I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. 
"
13,13,Butters,"Let us not forget what happens this day!
"
6,16,Stan,"It's just a show! It doesn't have any fucking effect on me, for fuck's sake!
"
2,15,Kyle,"Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!
"
11,10,Cartman,"Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. 
"
12,13,Stan,"Uh, Wendy?
"
18,9,Kyle,"Oh no! No, Ike! You are not watching him comment on things!
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Alright!
"
15,5,Cartman,"What do you want me to do, Kyle? Find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules?!
"
2,3,Cartman,"10-4, sergeant! 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Shut up, Eric! There's gonna be 4 million children playing this song at the same time on their recorders, and, so help me God, South Park Elementary is not gonna be the only ones that don't know the song! Try again! Recorders up.  And a-1 and a-2 and a- 
"
1,1,Kyle,"Sure you do!
"
8,5,Cartman,"I'm not a robot, dumbass! I'm alive!
"
6,6,Cartman,"We decided to get some one-on-one time with Jimmy and ride the log ride.  The great thing was that, because Jimmy's crippled, we got to go to the front of the line.  That was definitely big points for Jimmy, you know, but, but then we got to the ride itself, and...
"
2,18,Stan,"Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Why are you wearing a condom?
"
10,2,Stan,"Kyle! Du-what is going on?!
"
8,5,Butters,"He's made in Japan!
"
13,8,Kyle,"It's okay, Ike, you're going to be... okay.
"
16,2,Stan,"She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen.
"
3,8,Stan,"But you know, I learned something today. I used to call you guys Melvins. But you're just kids, like me. We separate you in school because you talk different and you study too hard, but we've proven tonight that we can all get along.
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"Uh-yes, apparently John Lennon's killer said he was inspired by The Catcher In The Rye, but he was just a kook! 
"
15,14,Kenny,"(Good for me.)
"
3,8,Randy,"Hohn.  Um, I don't know. Maybe I'll drink a few more beers and see where the party takes me.
"
15,13,Stan,"I didn't think so.
"
5,7,Stan,"No!
"
15,5,Cartman,"Because we need a Jew to do the bookkeeping.  Dammit!  Kyle, wait I-  Kyle, hold on a second!
"
13,6,Randy,"One point five?
"
9,13,Kyle,"I'll meet up with you guys in a little bit. I-I wanna hang out here some more.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.
"
1,7,Stan,"That's okay Wendy, I'm sorry I wished you were dead.
"
11,10,Cartman,"What? Move aside, move aside! 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Just reach in there and get the seamen out of her stomach!  Oh, God! You guys are such pussies!  Hemmm...
"
6,15,Stan,"I didn't start by saying Peter is dead! I started by saying, ""They want me to acknowledge Peter."" That could have meant Peter was in the audience or that Peter was somebody's friend, or Peter had died. I couldn't be wrong, see? Now, I can look at this woman and see that she's fairly young, so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died. So I can say something like, ""I'm getting that Peter's death was very untimely""
"
13,7,Cartman,"Yes, bebebudjuhbluhbluhbluhbluh. Thank you. 
"
10,10,Cartman,"You seen this woman, brah?  She's staying here!
"
9,1,Kyle,"I hate being small and Jewish. I feel like a tall black man.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Jesus Christ, Cupid Me, you givin' birth in there?!
"
8,3,Kyle,"Right. But he can't live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus wasn't really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy. And he didn't deserve what happened to him in Mel Gibson's movie. I I can't sleep at night. I mean, my... friend can't sleep at night.
"
4,7,Cartman,"No no, no no, nono no!Nonono, no no!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?
"
8,2,Jimmy,"I said, shut your mouth, bitch! Why did you make me do it, huh?!  You're not leavin' anybody! You just keep your G-Goddamned mouth shut and do what you're t-t-t-uh-tol-told!  '
"
12,10,Stan,"I'm so sick of hearing this music everywhere I go!
"
2,12,Stan,"But I didn't write the note!
"
7,7,Stan,"We can stay. And fight.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Right. Why?
"
7,9,Cartman,"Yes, we sure do.
"
12,9,Wendy,"You can't bribe your way out of this!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
4,14,Stan,"Uh-eally? Uh you think so?
"
9,5,Randy,"Well I think that there's a uh...
"
9,4,Cartman,"Fine! We'll see about this, you freakin' Jew!  I'm gonna get that feeding tube removed if I have to go all the way to the Supreme Court! 
"
10,9,Butters,"Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Oh, it's okay. We're Crips ourselves. Come on, Tim-Tim.
"
14,10,Stan,"What the fuck?
"
14,2,Butters,"I have to come right to my room after school.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles.
"
3,5,Stan,"Sh! Keep quiet, stupid!
"
2,12,Stan,"Fine!
"
3,13,Cartman,"Yeah, well this year I have a secret weapon! 
"
18,6,Randy,"You guys wanna put some money on it? 
"
2,6,Cartman,"Ey, you guys! 
"
14,4,Stan,"Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously!  What the hell is this?! Podcast?
"
11,1,Stan,"Dude, I don't get it.
"
9,5,Stan,"Disqualified?  Fight! Keep fighting! 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Oh, hey, Kyle.
"
12,10,Cartman,"All right Craig! 
"
4,2,Cartman,"Sure, Kyle.
"
2,8,Kyle,"Yeah!
"
4,3,Cartman,"Oh, God, that was soo funny! Oh, man, somebody stop my guts frm bursting out of my sides! 
"
6,16,Stan,"Three four five one Colfax Avenue. Come on, Butters. 
"
4,2,Stan,"No!
"
14,8,Butters,"But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil.
"
7,4,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, let's all take out our math homework and go over the problems.
"
13,7,Kyle,"Yes! I can't help but take some credit for this. I helped convince him to go!
"
18,5,Cartman,"You were listening, but we didn't know you were there?! How is that not spying?! You'r a dick! You're a spying dick! And now you wanna lecture Kenny about spying?! Fuck you, hypocrite dick spy! 
"
3,10,Stan,"What?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Yes! Yesss!! Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott!  Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.
"
10,13,Cartman,"No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out.
"
10,4,Kyle,"Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here.
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Well, hello, Eric. I was really glad you called me, very much.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Yes! Now will you all pay attention, please?! The vagina and the clitoris are on the outside, and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye.
"
13,8,Cartman,"Yes! Yes I am, Billy Mays!
"
3,10,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?
"
12,3,Cartman,"They're innocent victims in this, Kyle! They have to hide or they'll be put to death! Something you just can't understand! 
"
16,14,Cartman,"Ey! You can't do that! Ey!
"
12,13,Mr. Mackey,"Third team foul on Westchester Bobcats, m'kay. Ball goes back over to the Cows.
"
6,8,Kyle,"What are you guys doin'?
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Here.) 
"
10,7,Stan,"Dude, we're not killing your mom.
"
6,11,Butters,"Huh, I'm over here, Dad.
"
6,2,Randy,"Yeah, but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo. So we all get to come to Aspen for two weeks every year!
"
3,3,Cartman,"No, not with my eyes. With these!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, I'm really having a hard time with our Christmas play.  The new law states we can't sing any songs having to do with Jesus or Santa Claus.
"
1,8,Stan,"Oh my god, they've killed Kenny!
"
6,9,Cartman,"That and youth. Those guys are old.
"
17,3,Cartman,"It's gonna be okay. I think we're all safe now.
"
12,1,Kyle,"What? No?!
"
15,9,Kyle,"No, you're fat to begin with, chubby! Now you're Texan too!
"
3,10,Cartman,"Uh seriously! Mom! Must go! Must buy!
"
9,3,Cartman,"What?! Uh they're not so great! They probably don't have a fountain in their lobby!
"
15,13,Kyle,"But I always read that Native Americans were here, and that Pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them.
"
11,2,Butters,"Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oh, dude, oh.
"
2,15,Kyle,"He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
"
4,17,Stan,"Yeah! And we can call it... ""The Spirit of Christmas"" 
"
9,2,Randy,"Nyugh!
"
15,3,Stan,"My sister is a den leader in Girl Scouts.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here?  Flame on!  Flame off! 
"
4,9,Kenny,"(Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)
"
18,2,Randy,"They don't care about us. face it! We're already dead to them. 
"
6,3,Kyle,"That looks awesome!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Isn't he awesome, you guys?
"
3,5,Cartman,"Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction.
"
14,8,Butters,"It has to be, Eric.  Eric, where are you going?
"
5,1,Stan,"Holy fucking shit!
"
1,12,Stan,"Robert Smith? Sweet!
"
6,15,Stan,"Look, I went and saw that John Edward guy. He's just a big douche.
"
10,3,Randy,"JUST GET THE GUN!! 
"
7,15,Kyle,"What the hell??
"
10,14,Stan,"Ogh.
"
4,2,Kyle,"...Totally what?
"
1,3,Kyle,"I guess so.
"
2,7,Kyle,"How come the visitors aren't coming for him.
"
6,4,Stan,"Go on, dude it's the only way.
"
8,7,Randy,"Because you're being grounded, Stanley! Now I don't wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth!  You just sit right there, Stanley, and you thnk about what you've done! 
"
11,9,Randy,"You wanna see it?
"
11,14,Stan,"Kyle! Kyle, don't!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Well which is it gonna be, Butters?! Are you gonna ditch out with me or are you gonna disobey the teacher's stupid rule?!
"
2,2,Kyle,"I don't know if that's gonna be too easy. 
"
1,6,Stan,"It's eight o'clock, my favorite TV show is on.
"
17,6,Stan,"If you wanna suck farts, Kyle, that's fine. Go ahead. But you can't suck farts and be a dick about it.
"
1,5,Kenny,"Mmmmmm! 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Wing?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Check it out, dude. The camera shoots one frame at a time. So, all we gotta do, is put the right mouth on, according to what syllable they're pronouncing at that frame.
"
18,3,Randy,"Help me unload the c-car. Help me unload, load the car. Yah yah yah. Unloadin'. Unload yah yah yah.
"
14,5,Stan,"Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!
"
16,5,Kyle,"Where's your lunch, Butters?
"
5,13,Kyle,"Hey dude, how's it going?
"
10,1,Kyle,"Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!
"
2,17,Stan,"Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.
"
11,1,Kyle,"I don't get it either.
"
8,11,Cartman,"Stan, are you getting good ideas?
"
6,12,Kenny,"(We can watch it at my house.)
"
6,3,Stan,"What disease should we say?
"
2,16,Kyle,"Oh. Arrggh! 
"
11,10,Butters,"Don't leave me, fellas! Come back! 
"
3,12,Cartman,"Nno Grandma.
"
1,7,Kyle,"Chef, you've gotta help us!
"
10,13,Cartman,"Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Hup hup. Come on, hang on. 
"
5,14,Butters,"Bennigan's?? Oh, boy, you mean it??  Whoopee, at Bennigan's I'm gonna get the Rain Champ baby-back ribs! 
"
13,4,Kyle,"Robbed us of our innocence.
"
18,8,Kyle,"This is it. 1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.
"
7,8,Stan,"Oh My God, this is not a fad, this is who we are!
"
6,9,Cartman,"...No, he has an icy heart.
"
12,12,Kyle,"E-excuse me, my little brother needs medical attention.
"
13,7,Butters,"Oh jeez. Unh I don't know if I can really go through with this.
"
16,11,Kenny,"(Excuse me, he needs to go to Hawaii.)
"
1,1,Kyle,"Give me back my brother! 
"
6,8,Cartman,"Okay, let's go, Jew! 
"
12,13,Stan,"Huh? 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Big surprise!
"
13,5,Cartman,"Alright, so check it out: We've got offers from Van de Kamp's and Gorton's Fisherman to do commercials.
"
10,6,Cartman,"No, you just have to save me. 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the coolest.  God damnit, there's no more Pengins!  Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it. 
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Are you sure this is where they said to be?
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell are you talkin' about?!
"
11,10,Jimmy,"Hey Kyle. So, ...how was it?
"
13,4,Wendy,"Hey guys, we have a little surprise for you.
"
9,12,Stan,"Thetan levels...
"
10,6,Stan,"Agh.
"
2,8,Stan,"Hey, look! We blew up the snake! 
"
4,2,Butters,"Yuh, yu-yes ma'am!
"
10,4,Cartman,"Why not?
"
7,12,Stan,"...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?
"
7,3,Kyle,"Oh wait, wait, there's kids inside.
"
12,8,Kyle,"I dream about it every night. Every time I close my eyes I see us just running away, running while they ray-rape him over and over again.  And because we did nothing... they got away.
"
7,13,Kyle,"Who's going to kill you?
"
10,10,Cartman,"...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
"
10,2,Kyle,"But Dad, I want-
"
12,10,Kyle,"...Become a Peruvian flute band?
"
8,8,Butters,"Whe-where as Giant Douche is just, well, ju-just a, ju-ju-just a giant douche.
"
7,3,Kyle,"You wanna kill me?! Fine!  I can't live like this anymore! Go ahead! Do it! 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
13,7,Cartman,"But guys, g-i-n-g-e-rs can't be pirates because they don't have souls. Please get it out of here.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I'm just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.
"
4,6,Cartman,"I'll tell you why! Because you guys are jealous and can't handle the fact that you're immature, and so you've started a government conspiracy against me!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Where is your son?!
"
15,4,Cartman,"There, you see?! Can you fucking believe it?!
"
7,3,Kyle,"You con-fessed?
"
1,3,Cartman,"Hey you guys, this works pretty good right now.
"
2,10,Stan,"Milkshakes?!
"
7,7,Randy,"How's your... mother?
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Heellp!!)
"
5,14,Butters,"Yep. He went in there and wrestled with all kinds o' guys. He wasn't too good, though. This one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight!
"
17,8,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Hey, Timmy's back!
"
6,2,Stan,"Who cares? I'm having more fun on my own.
"
1,7,Kyle,"Yeah, he was too young to be taken from us.
"
18,9,Cartman,"More specifically, I'm going to comment on my friends commenting on Call Of Duty, so let's start.
"
16,13,Stan,"You're wearing a brown bracelet, Butters?
"
2,4,Kyle,"You bastards! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"We've gotta get you out of here! Come on! Oh oh no wait, I forgot! The toxic radiation! Hey wait! We can use this box!  There we go. This should keep you protected from the toxins.
"
10,9,Kyle,"Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
"
16,14,Kyle,"Tell us what you know right now!
"
2,4,Kyle,"Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.  Knock it off, asshole!
"
18,5,Butters,"Jeeeeezz!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Come on, you guys! We better get to work! 
"
2,3,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children. Each of you gets to choose two books from the Booktastic bus.
"
2,7,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman!
"
10,1,Cartman,"Run Chef!
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Here you go, it's right in here. 
"
16,10,Randy,"Thad. Nice. You um, havin' a busy day?
"
2,13,Kyle,"That's better.
"
15,11,Randy,"Whoa, no way!
"
6,5,Stan,"Huff, huff
"
9,8,Stan,"Maybe they couldn't get out!
"
14,9,Kyle,"What am I, Mom?
"
15,5,Cartman,"I'm volunteering, Kyle! It just so happens Sarah McLachlan touched my heart. Is that so hard to believe?!  Goodbye, Ms. Williams. See you tomorrow. 
"
8,8,Stan,"Awww!
"
2,9,Kyle,"He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide worldeh, and I don't want him to die. 
"
8,4,Stan,"Yeah, I'm- I'm right here, Dad.
"
5,9,Cartman,"What did you call us?!
"
2,13,Stan,"Oh, hey, Cartman. How are you feeling?
"
3,11,Stan,"* I told you, fatass.
"
2,4,Stan,"Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you. 
"
16,4,Cartman,"JESUS IS A LIE!
"
8,9,Stan,"Dad, oh my God!
"
16,3,Cartman,"Come on everybody,
It's Faith Hilling time.
Dancin', rappin', titties flappin' where are you?
This is the only memeing I'll ever do.
"
10,8,Cartman,"It's okay.  Mom? Bathroom!
"
8,1,Stan,"I dunno. Craig, is that you?
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"I know, I know. I'm sorry, children, but we can't afford chalk anymore. I have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail. Anyway, children, in the sentence, ""The ball is red..."" 
"
11,12,Butters,"Stan!  Hey look, I imagined Stan here!
"
17,2,Randy,"I almost got it, Sharon. I found out where the horse is; now I just gotta figure out how to tame one.
"
9,12,Stan,"And best of all, I wrote that all the Scientologist's should no longer have to pay money to belong.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Okay, fine! Whatever! Go ahead! 
"
9,6,Butters,"Lu lu lu, lu lu lu 
"
11,14,Kenny,"(Aah-) 
"
1,7,Cartman,"Eeehh, I don't want to see a educational video-o. 
"
16,3,Cartman,"Hehe hehe, that was sweet you guys. 
"
6,14,Kyle,"Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Alright. on behalf of the XBox fighters of Zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up, okay?
"
2,18,Stan,"Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach!  Bluchluchluchluch.
"
7,11,Jimmy,"Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant'duhh ...anecdote.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Kenny wasn't lying.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Yes, come in, please. 
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"What?! Why?! Don't worry, I will be better! These kids just aren't listenin' to me!
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Why sure fellas.  Anyway, be sure to check it out, kid.
"
17,1,Butters,"Hello?? Hey Government... It's me... Butters. Ah I just wanna say, well, well, thanks for watching over me and, and doin' everything you do. ...An and please watch over Mommy, and Daddy, ah an and my friends Stan and Kyle, Craig and Token, and and even ol' Eric Cartman. Uh I know he can be a meanie sometimes, but please watch over him too. Goodnight, Government.  Oh yeah.  Ah, and thank you, President Obama, for, for making me feel so safe and looked after. And if it wouldn't be... too much trouble...  I'd really like to get a puppy for Christmas this year.  'Night, Government. 
"
16,11,Butters,"No! Kenny's my friend! He's the only kid at school I actually like, you buncha jerks!
"
2,18,Kyle,"His name... is Steve!
"
8,1,Kyle,"It's hopeless, dude! Butters must have made it to the hospital. By now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons! We have to get rid of the evidence! 
"
7,2,Butters,"Oh yeah, well, about that... Christopher Reeve came to town to do some kind of show, and everyone went to see him.
"
16,2,Randy,"Six thousand?!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Oh, this should be good.
"
6,17,Kyle,"Cartman, I thought all you wanted was a Haibo doll!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Yeah, fat boy saw it!
"
2,12,Stan,"Remember, ""Truth"" the first couple of times.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people's amusement, but I don't work for free. I'm gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what's coming to us! 
"
7,9,Cartman,"I told you, Token.
"
11,14,Kyle,"Llook, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I I didn't think I was the very ugliest.
"
3,10,Stan,"Ogh..!
"
18,3,Wendy,"This is the girls bathroom!
"
11,8,Cartman,"What?
"
1,1,Kyle,"Really? What about?
"
4,12,Cartman,"I wish I was still there.
"
3,3,Cartman,"I wasn't sleeping, I was just thinking really hard!
"
5,8,Stan,"Aw, crap!
"
8,10,Stan,"There is... one person.
"
1,9,Kyle,"Nobody believes in you, not even my friends.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Hi guys.
"
18,10,Stan,"Um, l-look ih if I could just talk to him real quick? I wanna try and stop him from making an ass of himself again.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Good for you. 
"
11,13,Butters,"Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!
"
2,17,Stan,"I don't get it.
"
8,8,Kyle,"All right, it's decided. Let's all write in ""Giant Douche.""
"
8,12,Wendy,"...But what does she do?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"I mean, I stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a Goddamn medal!
"
13,4,Stan,"Butters, I'm afraid things have gotten worse. All the women suddenly think that... queefing is funny.
"
3,8,Stan,"What, Pip?
"
5,14,Butters,"""White Swallow Bath House""
"
18,2,Stan,"Excuse me?
"
1,12,Cartman,"I don't remember.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Alright, just run with me on this, Eric. Say Eric, do you like fishsticks?
"
17,8,Stan,"The Princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian.
"
2,5,Cartman,"I dunno.
"
3,3,Stan,"Oh my God! She killed Kenny!
"
18,5,Cartman,"No it isn't.
"
17,6,Stan,"How come you're carrying Cartman's stuff?
"
6,3,Cartman,"But if I'm not the most out-of-control teen, I might not win the prize.  Excuse me, I wanna make a quick change. Where's wardrobe?
"
13,14,Kyle,"Ha, Goddamnit!  Haaa. Ohhhh. Ahh, ohh, uhh, agh, 
"
2,4,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Ike. 
"
4,7,Stan,"What the hell would you do with ten million dollars, fatass?!
"
12,12,Randy,"Sorry pal, but Obama's President now!  Obama! Obama! 
"
6,13,Kyle,"Butters?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"I will  NOT put up with  TOM foolery in my  CLASS room, children.  Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth.  Take that, Slavey! take it!  This'll get me fired for sure. 
"
3,14,Kyle,"What??
"
2,3,Cartman,"Do I get a nightstick?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR.
"
6,6,Butters,"Uh very well. You shall be my accomplice in evil. Together, we shall bring the world to its knees! A-and make all those who banished us from society run... red.
"
4,9,Cartman,"You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.
"
2,13,Cartman,"That's easy!
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Ji-Jimmy?
"
5,13,Cartman,"Hello. Is this the University of Colorado Biology Department? ...Great, uh I understand you're currently doing research on stem cells? Kewl, because I'm currently in possession of some aborted fetuses that I'm looking to unload? ...Uh, how much do you pay? ...No, no, come on, ah I got a guy who's gonna give me eighty dollars a pound right now. ...How about a hundred? ...Oh you're breaking my balls- I, I'll think about it.
Bosnod Medical Group? ...Yeah, I called earlier about the stem cells and the fetuses? ...Okay, hi Randy, yeah. ...Oh yes, they've been kept in a cool temperature, yeah. ...These are primo fetuses, Randy, I wouldn't jerk you around. ...So what can your company give me for 'em? ...Oh Randy, you're breaking my balls here. ...You're breaking my balls, Randy. 
Oh plehease! Okay, you tell me where you can get aborted fetuses for seventy cents on the dollar? You tell me, Chuck? ...Yeah, I didn't think so-You know, I'm just like the fetuses, Chuck. I wasn't born yesterday, either. Uh huh. ...So are you gonna talk to me, or are we just gonna keep bullshitting each other? Breakin' my balls, Chuck. 
I gotta unload these fetuses, you wanna do some research. Are we talkin' here or what? You're breaking my balls. ...I'm telling you, if you let this deal pass you by, you're making a fetal mistake.  That's a joke  ...A hundred ten. ...Alright, alright, we got a deal. ...Good bye.  Damn I'm good. 
"
12,2,Stan,"We have to get her away from all this, dude. People just aren't gonna let up. We have to take her somewhere to just be at peace.
"
9,11,Stan,"That's just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.
"
14,6,Cartman,"No! Noooo!
"
16,2,Cartman,"You may suck our collective balls, sir! 
"
10,9,Cartman,"What? People see the truth?
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Hoh Mr. Hat, I hate this! I wish I'd never had a nose job. 
"
9,10,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, it's Kyle! Our egg is okay! We'll be there in a couple of minutes!
"
1,4,Cartman,"Heh, he's doing something to his ass. He's not kicking his ass, but he's definitely doing something to his ass.
"
17,6,Stan,"I don't get it, Kenny.
"
16,11,Butters,"Well I don't know about the rest of ya, but I'm sick and tired of bein' pushed around all the time! I came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony, and I can't even have it, 'cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything!
"
3,2,Stan,"Where's our Bible?
"
11,13,Kyle,"Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! 
"
13,1,Stan,"Excuse us. Excuse us.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, it was complete brutality!
"
4,12,Cartman,"You guys are all such pussies!
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay-I think the best thing for Mr. Garrison to do is to go see his father.
"
11,14,Wendy,"It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list. 
"
18,1,Butters,"It's not coming up on my phone either. I... Holy Mother Mary!
"
11,1,Kyle,"...Huh?
"
7,15,Cartman,"We can't go to Canada, dumbass! It's Christmas!
"
2,4,Cartman,"Yeah, my ass is killing me.
"
2,12,Stan,"Excuse me.
"
3,3,Stan,"But why? Why would you quit?
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine!
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"Butters, you are not to let go of Eric's hand until you are both back on that bus! Do you understand?!
"
12,9,Wendy,"You are so pathetic!
"
15,10,Stan,"What?
"
12,7,Stan,"I know.
"
18,5,Butters,"What?
"
3,17,Stan,"Those New Yorker kids are gonna be here any second, and we still don't know what queef means.
"
11,10,Stan,"Dude...
"
17,6,Kyle,"He said the Muslims beat them here-  God damn it!
"
3,17,Cartman,"I told you guys! Here it is, right here. ""The brown noise.""
"
2,18,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face, pussy!
"
11,5,Stan,"Yeah, I wanna know already.
"
8,8,Butters,"Huh?
"
11,3,Butters,"Yeah! Dumb girls!
"
6,16,Stan,"No.  You know what I think? I think this is all an elaborate hoax!  And I think that whoever is doing it doesn't have very much respect for me!  See, the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them, to be honest with them. I think the whole future self thing is a lie, and lies are never the right way to get your message across.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Why not?
"
16,14,Butters,"I didn't say anything. I promise.
"
8,14,Stan,"But I thought you meant the Son of God!
"
1,6,Stan,"Yes?
"
10,12,Cartman,"I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Well, this is it. We have made our final decision and one of you is who we will be spending our childhood with, as our new friend. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"I was trying to make an appointment to see the principal about getting excused on Friday. So I can take my brother to go see Yo Gabba Gabba Live.
"
4,14,Stan,"Okay, here we go. 
"
4,10,Kenny,"(OH, SHIT!)
"
3,17,Kyle,"Yeah! That's Texas, butthole!
"
5,14,Butters,"For family fun and great food, too, come on down to... Bennigan's
Buffalo wings and fried food, cokes, and Foster Farms at... Bennigan's
Uhuh, hello?
So come and eat at...
"
12,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, you kids. 
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Anyway, I... I sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out, mm, hm mm.
"
13,8,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well, you know, I was just thinking we could... put on some music and watch videos and pound Mr. Slave's tight little ass.
"
16,4,Cartman,"These are professional people who go around tracking Sasquatches, Kyle! They aren't liars, and they aren't stupid!
"
11,5,Randy,"You...
"
16,6,Kyle,"We were stuck. We were completely stuck. 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Yeah, that's great Butters. Now get the hell out of my room.
"
3,12,Stan,"Okay. It's almost open. Ready? One, two, three!  Whoa, dude.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, so then the total is six for Filmore and now seven votes for Ike. Ike is the new class president.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Whattaya think?
"
2,3,Cartman,"Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus.
"
7,12,Cartman,"You were supposed to kick his ass, not lick his butthole!
"
8,14,Stan,"...What?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Oh, hi, guys.)
"
11,13,Stan,"Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! 
"
9,13,Kyle,"I can't, Mom. We're working on our school project.
"
5,1,Cartman,"Maybe you didn't hear me, Kyle: I said ""shit"" on television!
"
10,7,Cartman,"No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. 
"
15,4,Cartman,"Yeah, dude, they aren't gonna give us what we want!
"
8,9,Cartman,"... Whatever. I can go get another one at Wall-Mart. It was only five bucks. 
"
1,13,Cartman,"All this time! Why didn't you tell me, father?!
"
4,7,Cartman,"Well, perhaps I could see my way to giving up a kidney. For a price.
"
7,8,Randy,"Come on, fellas! Out of the malls and into the streets!
"
15,9,Cartman,"Dude!!  How did he get past the fence, Craig?!
"
7,12,Stan,"Uh, no. I've got a lot to do.
"
11,5,Kyle,"N-no way! Do it yourself.
"
2,14,Kyle,"Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys.  Hi, are you Elton John?
"
13,7,Cartman,"And a tricky lahty do
"
8,8,Wendy,"But aren't Indians and Redskins just as offensive?
"
9,1,Stan,"Uh excuse me, is this really a good idea?
"
4,9,Randy,"And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know. 
"
11,14,Butters,"Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls.
"
2,9,Stan,"Dude!
"
3,3,Cartman,"That asshole eye doctor screwed up my laser surgery; I have to wear these bandages for three days!
"
15,10,Butters,"NO Wikileaks! Bad!
"
16,12,Kenny,"Dude, fuck this. Let's bail! 
"
6,12,Cartman,"No no, I just drank his memories. I'm not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap. Stop calling me poor, you fat dick!  ...Oh Jesus Christ.
"
2,18,Kyle,"But it isn't right!
"
10,6,Stan,"I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
"
4,7,Timmy,"Timmiiihh!
"
6,7,Butters,"Fine! Then maybe I'll just forget about destroying the town and just run away and join the circus! 
"
10,8,Cartman,"Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle.
"
6,4,Stan,"Okay, that's far enough. I'm going to go delta.
"
9,8,Stan,"No. I broke the dam.
"
5,1,Stan,"But you're gonna miss it! They're gonna say ""shit"" and you're gonna miss it!
"
2,7,Stan,"What was that?
"
5,13,Stan,"What, Cartman? What's happened?
"
3,4,Stan,"This is gonna be so sweet, dude.
"
15,9,Butters,"Giddy up! 
"
4,15,Cartman,"Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this,  but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!
"
6,7,Kyle,"Only sixteen dollars? They can't be cool if they're only sixteen dollars. 
"
2,13,Kyle,"You bastard! 
"
9,5,Randy,"What do you wanna do, huh? 
"
9,5,Randy,"What? I thought this was a free country! 
"
3,4,Cartman,"Craig, what the hell are you doing home?! You're supposed to be out fighting Tweek!
"
6,8,Randy,"You know, I think we've just had it with the Church. All the horrible things they've done to kids, I... I think I'm gonna become an atheist!
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104...
"
12,9,Cartman,"What- what's up?  What what's up?  Wendy, don't forget: I'll tell my mom on you.
"
13,1,Stan,"Kenny! Hey, hey, Kenny! 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet. 
"
8,9,Randy,"Aaaah!  Yeaaah... &lt;/&gt;
"
2,17,Stan,"Wow, Tweek, your dad rocks!
"
11,5,Randy,"What?
"
6,7,Kyle,"There's nothing here! 
"
3,16,Cartman,"Well welcome to the club, Kenny. You got your period, so now you're a man. We can hang out together on New Year's Eve.  But first you need to buy some Maxi pads to stuff in the back of your pants so you don't get blood on your underwear.
"
9,3,Stan,"Jesus, they really want Wing as their client!
"
8,8,Cartman,"Oh, no! Noooo!!
"
9,4,Cartman,"I believe the people at home see he's NOT in pain because he's a tomato!
"
1,10,Stan,"Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked!  You've got to fight, Jesus.
"
9,2,Stan,"Dad!
"
7,12,Stan,"I'm gonna kick your ass...  bitch.
"
4,4,Kyle,"...I am eight.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Go on then! Say your last words!
"
1,2,Stan,"What were you talking about?
"
6,16,Butters,"See, here he is. Future Butters. Future self, this is my good friend,-
"
11,7,Kyle,"Shut up, Cartman!
"
18,7,Butters,"Huh, that was incredible!
"
17,3,Stan,"Cartman, are you feeling alright?
"
12,1,Cartman,"Kyle, what?!
"
3,2,Kyle,"She's upstairs.
"
6,13,Stan,"Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river.
"
5,4,Cartman,"I beg you to give me back my money.
"
6,7,Butters,"Hey, fellas.
"
2,9,Kyle,"O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead. 
"
6,9,Cartman,"Hit it, Tweek!  In the tropical isle with the coconut tree, there's a lots of-
"
15,6,Butters,"Oh, sweet jumping Jesus!
"
4,8,Wendy,"Huh?
"
8,3,Stan,"Everyone in the country's gonna see that movie. I guess... we have to go see it too.
"
1,11,Wendy,"Eeewwww! 
"
16,6,Stan,"...Shuttle?
"
16,8,Butters,"Huh?
"
17,10,Wendy,"I'm sorry. It's nothing personal, Lisa.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face.
"
10,10,Cartman,"And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, ""Do you smell lemon grass?"", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there.
"
6,16,Stan,"I told you, I can't stand my future self. I have to do whatever I can to not become a loser like him.
"
4,8,Kenny,"(Ah, fuck you!) 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Uh, what else?  Splash Mountain, that comes now-oh! 
"
7,15,Stan,"What is that?
"
13,7,Cartman,"Calm down, Clyde. Everything's gonna be okay!
"
12,13,Stan,"involves needing scissors and glue!
"
1,8,Cartman,"I get to wear it first, you guys.
"
4,9,Kyle,"Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
"
11,7,Kenny,"(Yeah, what are we supposed to do?)
"
3,4,Cartman,"I win!
"
2,5,Cartman,"Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Erica.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Is here. To see me.
"
9,5,Randy,"Heeey!
"
1,13,Cartman,"Westsa-eed-eh.
"
14,1,Kyle,"Butters! Butters, stop it!
"
9,1,Kyle,"Totally! I totally understand!
"
3,14,Butters,"Oh. O-oh, okay.
"
15,10,Wendy,"So you didn't e-mail anybody else about Elise Thompson's butt crack, right?! 
"
1,2,Wendy,"Gooood.
"
1,4,Cartman,"What's homecoming?
"
3,8,Stan,"I don't want to go to this stupid party!
"
10,2,Stan,"Dude, what happened?? 
"
16,3,Stan,"Yeah, now you're doing to see how many times you can say Oh Long Johnson. I thought just, you know, try it out.
"
5,4,Stan,"One please.
"
6,4,Stan,"You're the ones who made me eat veal without telling me what it was! You're the one who know we were making little baby animals suffer! 
"
6,15,Stan,"That's us. Come on.
"
3,4,Stan,"Stay pissed, Tweek. Stay pissed.  All right. Here we go.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Right! Oral sex, which of course would be...
"
15,10,Wendy,"Do you have any idea how embarrassed I am?! 
"
7,4,Stan,"Uh... war?
"
16,1,Kyle,"So we were just wondering if we could sue somebody.
"
10,10,Kyle,"What?
"
13,13,Butters,"Hey now! Me and us fellers were just asking questions!
"
13,12,Stan,"All right, thanks for coming, everyone. As you all know, the Harley problem seems to be getting worse, and nobody is willing to do anything about it.
"
7,7,Stan,"Mom! Dad! We figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars!
"
5,2,Stan,"Uh, hello? We are having a bake sale to raise money for scout troop number six nine. Uh, please stop by and give us a hand. And now, for your entertainment, our new best friend, stand-up comic Jimmy! 
"
8,9,Randy,"Gaaah! Don't look! Don't look at its bargains! 
"
4,8,Stan,"I don't think we stand a chance in this debate, 'cause Wendy's leading the other side.
"
16,12,Kyle,"Dude, you can't miss Halloween! You have your iPad?
"
2,13,Kyle,"That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
"
2,16,Stan,"All families suck ass!
"
2,13,Kyle,"Open the gate! 
"
9,3,Cartman,"Gay.
"
9,3,Kyle,"We're not talented?
"
4,14,Cartman,"Okay, uh, hold it. Uh, let's hold it right there a second.  Okay, I just want to adjust the blocking real quick. Hm-let's see. Uh, why don't we have Turkey #2  stand just a little bit more over...  here.  Let's see, maybe a little more up in here.  And just a wee bit over here.  And right about...  hm'ere.  There we go. Good. 
"
5,14,Butters,"Well first, he went to see a movie.
"
15,1,Cartman,"I can't wait to see the look on Kyle's stupid face when he sees my iPad has more memory than his!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Do you wanna play rough?! Okay!  Take this! 
"
2,5,Cartman,"I caught it, I caught it!
"
8,10,Cartman,"""But Mo-o-o-om.""
"
7,14,Stan,"Just go talk to her an, and be poetic. Tell her she's my Muse-no! Tell her,  tell her...  she's a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me.
"
8,8,Stan,"I was put on the horse. I didn't wanna ride it.
"
7,4,Kenny,"(But Dad, I-)
"
4,1,Butters,"Uh-get set. Go! 
"
9,9,Stan,"Yeah dude, of course. Now go, the party's already started.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Excuse me? Could we get through here?
"
13,3,Butters,"Well don't worry Kyle. We're not gonna let people kill you. We'll keep you hidden forever!
"
13,6,Randy,"Sharon, Stan's Pinewood Derby race is tomorrow! Do you have any idea how important this is to him? Stan is not gonna lose to the goddamn Hollises again!
"
10,1,Stan,"No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!
"
9,8,Stan,"No.
"
10,12,Cartman,"I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!
"
17,7,Stan,"When we started this fight... it was because we were tired of XBox people telling us Playstation sucks! Now... we have an army of our own!  I can't guarantee you will live, but I can guarantee that before this is over... the winner of the console wars will be decided.  Our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the PS4! All hail the Princess! 
"
15,5,Kyle,"Gravy?
"
12,5,Cartman,"Again!
"
5,9,Cartman,"Ey, what the hell are you talking about?!  I'm not a god-damned Canadian, and neither are you!
"
6,4,Stan,"Hello?
"
12,3,Cartman,"All right, bring out...! The other male cat. 
"
1,3,Kyle,"What is that?
"
12,5,Cartman,"Oh, well, thank you. I believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning.
"
1,2,Stan,"Wendy, look! 
"
8,13,Cartman,"You can't hurt me.
"
10,6,Cartman,"No! No I'm fine!  I just need to get home, a-and rest.
"
16,6,Kyle,"And so they put us in these harnesses and helmets. I th-I think that's when we started realizing, ""Oh wow, this is actually pretty dangerous.""
"
16,6,Kyle,"Ziplining was your idea, you fatass!
"
7,1,Stan,"Wait! Wait, they they can't do this! Uh, let us talk to the network heads!
"
8,10,Butters,"Hwell. Oh, uh, hi Dad.
"
13,4,Randy,"Come on Stanley, let's go. 
"
4,2,Stan,"Two dollars!
"
3,10,Cartman,"...Gay.
"
10,3,Kyle,"Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before.
"
7,11,Cartman,"No! No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We've gotta find a bomb shelter!
"
11,4,Kyle,"I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Hey, can it, jackass! I just don't want them to know I was here with a different girl.
"
4,14,Kyle,"Cartman, where's Timmy's turkey?
"
16,13,Stan,"Dude, the hell just happen?
"
11,2,Kyle,"Dude!
"
7,8,Stan,"Kyle. Hey, ese. You wanna come play catch with us?
"
7,14,Stan,"...'K.
"
5,5,Kyle,"But we promised the Earth Day people you'd perform.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Because I saw you. Okay? In your room, passed out, with a VR headset on. Customer Service said that one of us needed to put on the headset and come get you, and that's why I'm here.
"
17,1,Butters,"Hallelujah!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Yes, the tears of Kyle Broflovski when he loses his ten dollars to me. 
"
8,8,Kyle,"You won't get more votes than us, asshole!
"
11,2,Butters,"No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Light is a wave unless it's observed? That means all matter is just a wave.  Nothing's real! Reality in a nuh- Oh God, it's happening! 
"
6,7,Stan,"Are they playing basketball? 
"
8,5,Butters,"AWESOM-O?
"
7,1,Kyle,"That's it!  I don't care about the fate of the world! Screw it!
"
4,11,Cartman,"This is bea-utiful. Thine church is almost completed.
"
2,2,Cartman,"You've got to be kidding me!
"
1,3,Kenny,"(Hey, what's that?)
"
18,6,Stan,"You guys, is it that much dumber than video games you play?
"
6,11,Randy,"Don't you worry. I'm sure that Stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe, off in a whole new city by now, making a new life for themselves.
"
16,6,Stan,"Thank God. 
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Okay.) 
"
13,1,Kenny,"(It means I'm gonna be pure and not have sex until I get married.)
"
2,12,Randy,"Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Whatevah! I'll crap in Maury's pants! 
"
5,1,Stan,"What's the Black Death, Chef?
"
8,2,Cartman,"Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: ""At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"" 
"
13,11,Cartman,"Really tough, you know. It's... really hard. It's like , we've dedicated all this time and all our lives to saving these majestic creatures.
"
8,10,Kyle,"We're firemen!
"
8,4,Stan,"What happened??
"
6,10,Stan,"Hoh hoh hoh!
"
8,5,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing, fatass?
"
6,5,Cartman,"Bluh! Aah! You guys! Seriously!
"
2,12,Kyle,"What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!
"
3,14,Cartman,"You can't just ""hit"" a drum, you have to beat the shit out of it!  Shut you butthole, or I'll kick your ass, you fuckin' drum!!  That's how you rock, dude.
"
10,11,Butters,"That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the  I truly love to brush my teeth.  Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls...  Biggie Smalls...  
"
7,10,Randy,"This is insane, Dad! You all need to stop right now before more people get hurt!
"
9,3,Cartman,"So, why shouldn't we get some of that money? We can be Token's agents. That way, we get ten percent of whatever he makes!
"
6,6,Stan,"Okay, let's try this. 
"
2,12,Cartman,"How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?
"
3,12,Kyle,"Damnit, Cartman, that's not funny!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Well, so can we play here?
"
6,4,Stan,"It... did?
"
15,4,Cartman,"What, Kyle?
"
6,10,Stan,"Hoh. Hoh?
"
12,6,Randy,"And so what have we learned through this ordeal? The Internet went away. It came back. But for how long we do not know. We cannot take the Internet for granted any longer. We as a country must stop over-logging -on. We must use the Internet only when we need it. It's easy for us to think we can just use up all the Internet we want. But if we don't treat the Internet with the resPECT  that it deserves, it could one day be gone forever. So let us learn to live with the Internet, not for it. No more browsing for no apparent reason, no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television. And finally,  We must learn to only use the Internet for porn twice a day. Max. 
"
2,16,Cartman,"See ya, Uncle Howard.  Thanks for being such a great role model for me.  Piece of crap.
"
1,1,Kyle,"This is it. This one's for the game.
"
12,6,Randy,"Uh, you go ahead, Sharon. Divide some Internet amongst the children. I- gotta talk to somebody.
"
4,7,Stan,"Look, um... I know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure Kyle, but... the doctor at the hospital told me it can't.
"
7,1,Stan,"Oh, uh... we have a three o'clock meeting with the network heads?
"
7,13,Kyle,"No.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Eh-sure.
"
15,10,Cartman,"So... whatcha doin' for lunch? Eh, my mom packed me the best stuff. She even baked cupcakes. 
"
6,12,Cartman,"I found this car seat in Mr. Garrison's car. 
"
8,8,Jimmy,"And the second?
"
18,9,Cartman,"That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Butters! When did you call Oculus Rift Customer Service?!
"
6,7,Cartman,"Is it her?
"
16,2,Stan,"Yeah.
"
7,6,Stan,"Right, so it's possible that the thief sat out in that tree.  He would have watched Sarah with the doll, possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife.  The pain gave him sick pleasure.
"
12,6,Randy,"I know, right?
"
2,14,Kyle,"What's going on?
"
4,17,Stan,"I know, it's like it doesn't matter anymore.
"
1,12,Kyle,"Well, Ike. You can tell Cartman that it's my triangle!
"
8,9,Randy,"Staan...
"
4,13,Cartman,"Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now?  Ugh--!
"
6,6,Kyle,"Tweek. Now there's an interesting choice. Tweek has a lot of qualities that I look for in a friend.
"
10,14,Stan,"How are you feeling?
"
3,14,Randy,"Ow! That hurt!
"
6,10,Stan,"Dude, we're not kicking Kyle out!
"
8,8,Cartman,"Butters, shut the hell up! 
"
2,16,Stan,"Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old!  I don't need this stupid family anyway! 
"
1,9,Stan,"You guys!  I'm getting that John Elway football helmet for Christmas!
"
9,8,Stan,"We can sneak out of here, get a boat, and go help them off their roofs. That way, I can do the right thing, but still lie about it.
"
7,10,Randy,"Well, I think he learned his lesson. Huh? Don't you feel silly now, Dad? I think somebody owes us all an apology. Yes he does.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Uh huh?)
"
1,13,Mr. Garrison,"Damn, Damn, Damn!! Oh well, I guess it'll just have to be you and me, Ms. Cartman. 
"
8,4,Kyle,"All right Stan!
"
14,6,Kyle,"Really sorry about all this, dude.  So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Suck my asshole, taco vendor!
"
12,9,Wendy,"Is there a problem?! Because breast cancer isn't funny! Breast cancer is killing people!
"
2,7,Stan,"Come on Cartman, fart!
"
1,1,Cartman,"God damn it, they didn't do anything to my ass! It was just a dream!
"
16,11,Kyle,"Butters?  Why?
"
7,3,Stan,"You, you do? How?
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh, that's me!
"
7,11,Cartman,"For the past five days I've been looking out into space for a school project. This morning, at 3:45 a.m. I... caught first sight of something terrible.
"
2,7,Stan,"Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
"
11,13,Cartman,"Stop cheating, Craig! 
"
15,7,Cartman,"Alright now, open presents! Open presents!
"
12,9,Wendy,"Thank you Mr. Garrison.  Fellow students, October is Awareness Month for one of the leading causes of death among women. A terrible disease that takes the lives of American women every day. I'm talking, of course, about breast cancer.  An estimated one in six women will deal with cancer in their lifetime, and breast cancer is the most common- 
"
2,15,Kyle,"Chef!
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"It's just the new diet fad! 
"
6,16,Randy,"Well I think when this is all over, our son is gonna thank us.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Yeah I don't know if I ever told you this before, but I'm actually an agent over at the Super Awesome Talent Agency. You may have seen our ads around town. Anyway, why don't you come down to the office, Token? Maybe I can convince the company to represent you.
"
10,12,Cartman,"No! No, it's too soon!
"
5,10,Stan,"Yeah, you missed them turning around.
"
6,16,Stan,"Butters, we've go-! Oh, God, it smells in here.
"
9,9,Stan,"Guys, guys, guys, stop!  Look at what this thing is doing to us. Butters was trying to tell me something outside the house. That this device is nothing but trouble. I think I know what he meant now.
"
1,7,Cartman,"Hey, there's a pay phone!
"
8,7,Randy,"Hey, Stanley, you need to understand something: Those people from the future have had a hard life! Where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor! You can't even imagine the kind of depression they come from! So, for us, who have everything sooo good, to judge them, is wrong! Do you understand?! Next time you think about calling them goobacks, you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is!
"
10,6,Cartman,"Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. 
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Oh yeah! Woohoo!)
"
13,7,Butters,"Uhh,  mahjey burazi?
"
2,3,Cartman,"God-dammit! 
"
11,12,Cartman,"O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! 
"
16,10,Cartman,"You, it's fucking hilarious! Now can you shut off my INsecurity please?!
"
9,7,Butters,"That's right, Jimmy.
"
4,16,Butters,"Oh, alright then.  Uh, show 'em where it is.
"
10,3,Cartman,"Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! 
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Fellas! Do you have any idea how difficult comedy is? Can't we just spend one lunch and recess saying thanks to those who make us smile and laugh every day?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Yeah, but you know, why do we need Loogie? We know how the trade works: why don't we do it ourselves and keep all the profit?
"
1,11,Cartman,"Until you puked on her.
"
17,2,Butters,"Huh?
"
2,9,Stan,"Oh, brother.
"
6,3,Butters,"Well Oh, God! W-whatdya tell him?
"
12,6,Randy,"That's right. We need to get online.
"
6,12,Stan,"Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Yeess.  Yeess.  It worked, you guys, it actually worked!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Very well, Clyde. Kiyaaaa!
"
1,7,Mr. Garrison,"It sure does seem to be a popular costume this year Kyle.
"
8,14,Stan,"Okay, okay.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Luckily for us, my mom is a total lush.
"
2,10,Kenny,"(Hey you guys, what's goin' on?)
"
10,14,Stan,"Jesus Christ!  Stop! Stop this!
"
4,1,Kyle,"We killed Kenny?
"
11,3,Cartman,"Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem.  Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it.
"
3,1,Kyle,"What?
"
6,5,Cartman,"Aw, yeah, Butters, you lose, sorry, tough break.
"
1,6,Randy,"Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather. 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. 
"
9,8,Randy,"Go back, go back!!
"
6,8,Stan,"We don't know. We're- that's what we're tryin' to figure out.
"
10,7,Cartman,"She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.
"
3,17,Stan,"What word could we make up?
"
2,17,Stan,"Your dad really screwed us, Tweek!
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, no problem.  Usted es choir de Estados Unidos, mbien?
"
16,1,Cartman,"That's right.
"
9,8,Stan,"Sure I do!
"
12,3,Kenny,"(I almost... touched them.)
"
11,10,Kyle,"Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"Well, boys, it's obvious you didn't even--
"
16,7,Jimmy,"Ah I don't see a b- b- Bat-Mobile.
"
10,4,Kyle,"No more timeouts, fatass!
"
3,3,Cartman,"All right. Right now, I'm gonna be totally serious, dude. Okay? If you call me piggy one more time, I'm gonna leap out of this chair  and rip your god-damned nuts off with my bare hands!
"
18,10,Stan,"Yeah, you damn kids!
"
2,9,Cartman,"Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime.
"
2,17,Kyle,"No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?
"
4,11,Stan,"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
"
10,10,Cartman,"Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?
"
11,7,Kyle,"We're nine.
"
7,7,Kyle,"What is Native American comedy, anyway?
"
10,4,Cartman,"Stop it!
"
14,7,Jimmy,"Oh boy, here it comes! Here it comes! 
"
15,6,Butters,"Yes!
"
13,7,Kyle,"I know! I was lying then!
"
3,17,Kyle,"Yeah. They think they're so cool.
"
15,9,Butters,"I, am Mantequilla, the last of the Meheecans.
"
12,9,Cartman,"The, the thing is, I totally said I was sorry, but she still wants to beat me up. 
"
12,11,Randy,"We're in the  grocery store now. Some of the survivors here uh.
"
14,5,Cartman,"Screw this Conner.  Find yourself another partner.
"
6,7,Butters,"Haaah! 
"
18,8,Kyle,"Holy shit, dude!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Uh oh.
"
7,15,Kyle,"No. No!! 
"
18,6,Stan,"I shall return. Do not attempt to stop me. 
"
1,5,Kyle,"You hear that dudes? We'll be rich!
"
16,12,Stan,"Hey, be careful in there.
"
9,13,Stan,"Does the Mexican space programs have rockets that can go to the moon?
"
14,6,Cartman,"Take it easy, Conner. 
"
14,6,Randy,"Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off!  She's destroying everything!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Okay.  Now, as I was sayin, uh... drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Eh, uh if you do them, you're bad. Because drugs are bad, m'kay? It's a bad thing to do drugs. So-uh so don't be bad, by doing drugs, unkay? That'd be bad, 'cause drugs are bad. M'kay?
"
1,10,Stan,"Yeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Alright are you ready to try this, guys?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. 
"
10,7,Cartman,"Not interested I'm me?
"
11,11,Cartman,"No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus.  There we go.  Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?
"
1,1,Kyle,"Bad.
"
11,14,Stan,"I have no idea what you're talking about.
"
1,10,Cartman,"Yeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!
"
18,6,Stan,"Okay, I need help.  There is something different about me, you guys. I know the game is stupid, and it actually isn't even fun anymore. I don't understand.
"
7,11,Butters,"What??
"
12,12,Kyle,"Oh my God! 
"
13,6,Randy,"Nnno. Space cash? No.  There wasn't any space cash.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Oh-uh-uh, I don't drink, m'kay?
"
7,11,Cartman,"But... Casa Bonita.
"
14,5,Stan,"Oh God, you guys, really? This again? 
"
6,15,Stan,"We don't get to go to Scotland?
"
16,11,Cartman,"He said he had to go back to his homeland, and then told me it was none of my business and to keep my fat mouth shut.
"
5,6,Cartman,"But, you can ride anything you want. And you don't have to wait in line.
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Well, I've never seen anything like this. What do you think, principal?
"
6,1,Cartman,"Here you go.  I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.
"
15,8,Stan,"Dude, I'm sorry that I've been bumming you out, but it's not my fault!
"
1,6,Cartman,"Yeah! 
"
3,17,Stan,"Sh. Here they come. 
"
13,11,Stan,"Things are bad enough without you being a smartass! There's whales out there being slaughtered right now and I can't do anything about it, so just keep quiet!
"
1,1,Stan,"Hey, it's happening again. 
"
6,6,Stan,"I like it. 
"
4,12,Kyle,"Yeah! Timmy's probably back in third grade right now living it up!
"
15,14,Stan,"We can't let Kenny be sent away forever. There's gotta be something we can do.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmuh Timmy Timmy Timmy. 
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes.  I love Cartman's farts.
"
1,7,Stan,"Yeah! That's it Kenny, you can't trick-or-treat with us anymore!
"
15,2,Cartman,"Okay?! Jimmy, do you know what happened to the last people Germans were pissed off at?! Tell him, Kyle!
"
1,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo. Haven't you guys ever heard of it?
"
5,7,Butters,"Uh what are we gonna do, huh?
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, hi Jan, it's Counselor Mackey. Uh... how long would it take to organize a Pizza Friday for the students? Yeah, yeah no they uh, they actually did really well on the state exam. Yeah, mkay.
"
15,10,Stan,"Do you just leave your e-mails open for everyone to read?!
"
9,14,Stan,"Yeah, and I also know a thing or two about cults. I was the leader of one for a while.  Goddammit! 
"
16,8,Stan,"The guys are right. From now on, you're team captain, Butters. You lead us to victory.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Who are these buttholes?
"
6,4,Kyle,"Aw, dude. 
"
12,8,Butters,"...Can't believe they put 'em in jail. And I thought that movie was pretty good. 
"
11,7,Randy,"A bus! A bus is coming!
"
10,8,Cartman,"All right, yay.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Alright I'd better get out of here before they get back. 
"
2,6,Stan,"Action!
"
11,6,Stan,"Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Kyle! Kyle, hold on, you asshole!  What the fuck are you doing?!  Kyle, stop it!  God damn it, don't!  Kyle, no! Not Clyde Frog! Leave Clyde Frog alone!  NO!!  AHH! Clyde Frog!! Clyde Frog you ba- no! Not the Xbox, Kyle!  Not the X-wait! WAIT A SECOND!  I'm sorry I gave you HIV, all right?! Just give me a chance, and I can cure you!
"
2,2,Cartman,"That is really starting to piss me off.
"
1,4,Cartman,"I'll put a dollar on Sylvester.
"
5,1,Stan,"What are we supposed to do with it?
"
6,9,Stan,"Alright alright. But right now we've gotta focus on getting those original prints of Raider
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Now Wendy, I've tried to be patient with you 'cause you've always been a good student! M'kay?! But calling a little girl fat and ugly is NEVER n'kay!
"
4,15,Kyle,"Why?
"
5,5,Stan,"Oh no, dude.
"
12,10,Cartman,"Shave your balls? Why would you shave your balls?
"
14,3,Randy,"Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.
"
2,18,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! 
"
1,10,Stan,"Yeah, you weren't invited, new kid.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Butters didn't show? I I can't believe it. Uh are you sure you told him the right time and everything?
"
1,9,Mr. Mackey,"To try and stay positive stay away from drug and alcohol, and in the meantime I'm gonna put you on a heavy regimen of Prozac  Uuuuuuugghh-oh my God, you sick little monkey! 
"
11,14,Stan,"So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
"
16,6,Kyle,"Here!  Everyone drink some Mountain Dew!
"
2,12,Kyle,"Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
"
1,3,Cartman,"Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has…
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Ohuh... Yes.  Yes! Let's fingerpaint!
"
18,7,Butters,"You... you, you mean ih...  I'm not grounded?
"
3,1,Cartman,"Who'd you expect? Merv Griffin?
"
7,9,Cartman,"Butters, remind me later to cut your balls off.
"
12,7,Butters,"No.
"
11,5,Randy,"That's right.
"
7,2,Stan,"Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
"
2,11,Kyle,"I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
"
2,14,Stan,"Thanks, dude.
"
14,14,Randy,"Hello there, children!
"
11,14,Kyle,"No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover.
"
1,5,Stan,"Yeah, quit being such a baby.
"
7,3,Cartman,"You're an art teacher!
"
12,14,Butters,"I've done what you've asked.  A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can't eat people food.
"
1,5,Kyle,"Come on elephant, keep drinking.
"
1,3,Stan,"I can shoot you, fat ass!
"
5,7,Stan,"I'm beating off the dog. Red rocket, red rocket. 
"
7,15,Kyle,"Is that true?
"
18,6,Stan,"One?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Alright, just what the hell do you guys think you're doing?!
"
2,16,Stan,"What, dude? 
"
12,14,Butters,"What have I done to myself? I should have known I wouldn't have the stomach to be a vampire. I am so hungry.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Oh good! Cartman's back from the junkyard.
"
7,8,Kyle,"Gah! Just leave me alone! 
"
14,10,Stan,"What the hell's going on?!
"
5,4,Cartman,"How do I do that?
"
7,8,Randy,"I can't do anything! These are brand-new pants!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Full cheeks!  Winking brown eye, brown eye winking! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Oh, God, I can't see! 
"
7,5,Cartman,"What?
"
6,6,Cartman,"Five. 
"
13,14,Kyle,"Gah, ah.  Gaagh.
"
7,1,Cartman,"No.
"
16,11,Kenny,"(No, I'm not going to fucking betray anybody!)
"
18,6,Cartman,"What are you two boners doing?
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig?
"
17,9,Kenny,"Purincessu Kenni reporuto! 
"
10,4,Cartman,"Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny.
"
12,9,Stan,"What?
"
8,12,Stan,"Oh, thank God.
"
2,18,Kyle,"No you don't, butthole! 
"
4,14,Butters,"Hey you guys! We got a big problem! 
"
16,3,Kenny,"(Totally!)
"
15,11,Randy,"Yeah, yeah, and we really made some progress with the show. Andrew Lloyd Webber and those guys are gonna help us with it.
"
4,2,Kyle,"Come on, fatass!
"
9,6,Butters,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
9,6,Kenny,"(That guy would try anything)
"
3,13,Kyle,"U-u-uh, hi. 
"
4,6,Kyle,"I know, dude! Let's get the hell out of here! 
"
14,3,Randy,"No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer.
"
13,1,Butters,"Hey, Jimmy, what's a B.J.?
"
11,7,Kyle,"You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go.  They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something.
"
15,6,Butters,"Well no, ah I just thought it was one of your other personalities trying to give me a-
"
13,6,Stan,"What is that?
"
12,13,Wendy,"Congratulations, Bridon. Guess we'll be working a lot together.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Let's put our hands up, everyone! 'Cept for Jacob. His mom's so poor she only understands hand-OUTS. 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Uh, yeah, sure sure.
"
6,2,Butters,"Ehh, it kind of smells stinky in this condo. 
"
1,9,Kyle,"Wull, not on purpose.
"
16,14,Stan,"Pry his mouth open!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Okay. 
"
2,5,Kyle,"Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can't hurt us. Right? 
"
1,13,Kyle,"Yeah, dude. It looks riveting. 
"
12,10,Stan,"All right, fine, Craig. When we get back home we'll get you your money back, and we'll never talk to you again. How's that?
"
18,2,Mr. Mackey,"If it's not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay?
"
3,2,Stan,"See, at first, Jesus was all like, ""Why me?"" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying,  he raised his hand and said, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.""
"
8,11,Butters,"Hey! Let's run naked through the street! 
"
1,3,Kyle,"You were scared Cartman! you almost peed in your pants!
"
15,10,Mr. Garrison,"What's the matter?
"
7,11,Butters,"Whaaat??
"
16,4,Cartman,"We need to get to the city of Nassau in the Bahamas, here. 
"
7,8,Cartman,"You wish you were gay, Craig! In you dreams!!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Holy God, dude!
"
5,14,Butters,"Well I ain't in trouble for hollerin' at ya, am I?
"
13,14,Cartman,"Come on, let's go!
"
12,4,Stan,"Sh ush ush, it'sa it's on!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Aw come on, fuck you!) 
"
13,6,Randy,"What do you want?
"
8,9,Cartman,"Dude, check it out! Time Cop on DVD. Three copies for eighteen bucks!
"
9,4,Cartman,"Mom, I told you! The new Sony PSP game machines go on sale at seven a.m. today. I have to be the first to get one!  Come on! 
"
13,4,Randy,"I know, pal. Sometimes... bad things happen to good people. But you know Butters is still Butters, and he needs you guys right now more than anybody.
"
15,11,Randy,"I do respect you, bro!
"
11,13,Stan,"All right, dude, let's do this.  What the hell? 
"
3,16,Cartman,"Now, for our first club activity, we're supposed to reach into this little dish and pull out a word. We look at the word and think about what that word means to us. 
"
13,7,Kyle,"This isn't paradise and you know it! The people here are starving and dying! The whole world has used Somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste. Even the fish here are radioactive!  Cartman, just give me my brother  and let us get out of here!
"
6,15,Stan,"No, you give them false hope and a belief in something that isn't real.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Don't worry, I won't go too hard on you.  Good morning South Park Elementary, these are the morning announcements. Rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon. For lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta. My guest today is the student body president of South Park Elementary, Wendy Testaburger. Wendy, thank you for coming on the show.
"
1,13,Stan,"Is that legal?
"
8,9,Stan,"There! The television department!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Butters.
"
1,6,Stan,"Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?
"
5,3,Kyle,"This is a really good turnout.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys.
"
4,6,Kyle,"I know, hunh? Put your mouth against the glass like this.  Waaaaah! 
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh, come on! Japanese girls do it. 
"
3,1,Stan,"Oh my God, dude!! I just saw Tony Danza!!
"
6,7,Stan,"Uh oh.
"
3,13,Cartman,"T, H. ""Th."" There. Hey, this is easy!  I'm gonna win the spelling bee for sure, Mom!
"
9,3,Cartman,"I'll I'll call you back, Abe. 
"
4,4,Cartman,"Yeah, me too.
"
11,3,Kyle,"Wait... stop it, stop it!  I can't let Kenny be sock-dried.
"
1,7,Stan,"No, I'm Raggedy Andy, fatass!
"
17,3,Cartman,"A person. 
"
1,1,Kyle,"Hey, look, there's Wendy Testaburger.
"
11,14,Stan,"It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Thank you.
"
18,7,Stan,"Well then how much of what just happened was in virtual reality?
"
5,6,Kyle,"Oh God, get me off of here!! 
"
6,11,Stan,"...Dude, no way! I'm not wearing Child Tracker!
"
4,17,Kyle,"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You brought back the spirit of Christmas!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Right.
"
4,2,Stan,"Oh my God!
"
8,3,Kyle,"...You're a stupid asshole! 
"
16,7,Wendy,"Oh he's really nice, Nichole. I dated him for a little while. 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih, Timmiih!
"
3,8,Butters,"Whoa!
"
4,12,Stan,"Over here, over here!
"
15,8,Kyle,"That's what they're talking about on the news!
"
8,10,Cartman,"Maybe you didn't hear so good in there, Kyle! Second-degree titty-twister!
"
6,13,Cartman,"It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
"
11,2,Stan,"What'cha do to Butters this time?
"
6,17,Cartman,"No! Santa Claus can't be dead. He... He can't.
"
8,10,Kyle,"We need you to protect us... from a bully.
"
11,13,Cartman,"Oh my God this is so awesome.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Hey, hey! That's my bathroom! 
"
7,1,Kyle,"You don't?
"
11,13,Stan,"Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! 
"
11,9,Randy,"The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Europe?)
"
2,2,Kyle,"I don't know. Let's find out.
"
9,9,Stan,"We got it away from the girls. That's what matters. But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.
"
7,5,Cartman,"NO!
"
14,1,Kyle,"So what happens to us now?
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, is that fudge-packer Tom Cruise?
"
6,1,Cartman,"Well my hot spicy boner, of course, Dad.
"
1,8,Cartman,"No Sally Struthers, that's my cake eh-ehhhh!  You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!! 
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles, deh!
"
14,10,Wendy,"No, Stan, it's called ""hoarding""! And if you don't get help I don't know how much longer I could be with you!
"
1,6,Stan,"Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around. 
"
4,14,Timmy,"Agh oh-ight, Timmih!
"
16,4,Kyle,"That's how God is! And if Pharaoh doesn't give us what we want, next he's gonna kill all Egyptian first born boys!
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah, me too.
"
7,3,Kyle,"You just feel bad for yourself that you're in detention!
"
3,16,Kyle,"Awesome! We get powers?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!
"
12,8,Kyle,"My name is Kyle Broflovski. My friend was raped last Memorial Day weekend. And, and I  I'm gonna help prosecute the men responsible.
"
17,6,Cartman,"Yes, you're right, Kyle. I'm sure that that... is going to have earth-shattering consequences. Heheheheh. 
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, this is it, huh? Okay, uhhh Mike, why don't we have you try out first, ituh m'kay. 
"
6,9,Cartman,"Alriiight! Get it, Tweek!
"
16,1,Kyle,"Sir, we are really worried about our friend Clyde. Everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener.
"
6,7,Cartman,"If Nancy doesn't want to chip in, then it will be $5.35 per person!
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"WENDY, IN MY OFFICE, RIGHT NOW! OKAY?!
"
2,14,Kyle,"It’s the same goddamn song!
"
9,7,Stan,"Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They're giving away a hundred dollar first prize for the talent show.
"
13,12,Cartman,"You know, when people like you drive down the street with your unnecessarily loud motorcycles thinking you're all cool. Everyone is actually laughing at you and calling you pathetic faggots. You do realize this, right?
"
17,8,Cartman,"He's the guy who writes Game of Thrones, Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let's face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.
"
2,10,Cartman,"Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?
"
10,13,Cartman,"What is the Great Question?
"
4,17,Stan,"What's awesome?
"
1,12,Stan,"Wow! Robert Smith is the greatest person that ever lived!
"
17,6,Kyle,"I don't care.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Mother, did you know that ...Dad... never sexually molested me?
"
12,7,Stan,"Uhhh, look, can we just drop the whole roleplaying thing? I would play along, but my girlfriend's here and I don't wanna look like a total dork in front of her.
"
7,14,Stan,"Okay, so what's the most romantic thing I can think of?
"
2,6,Kyle,"Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! 
"
15,9,Butters,"Oh uh, I'm sorry,  I don't really-
"
4,1,Kenny,"(Huh? Uh.)  (AAAAAA!)  (Ufff!)  (Ugh!)
"
13,13,Cartman,"I don't know if we're turning into a Smurf-hating school or what we're turning into, but unless you ask why , we're gonna transform into something.
"
1,2,Wendy,"I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this. 
"
9,9,Cartman,"Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it.  All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that's left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.
"
10,14,Kyle,"All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan.
"
6,4,Stan,"See? Now we can hold out for weeks!
"
7,7,Stan,"Hey, my name's Stan, and I was-
"
6,7,Mr. Garrison,"Every idea's been done, Butters, even before the Simpsons.
"
9,6,Stan,"Well it's not like we're nice to him. I mean, we rip on him all the time!
"
5,4,Stan,"Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?
"
7,15,Cartman,"Oh no, no no nono, I am NOT flying in that thing!
"
3,13,Mr. Garrison,"Now, who can tell me what country Columbus was from?  Put your hand down, creampuff.
"
9,12,Stan,"Well go on, then! Sue me!
"
2,18,Cartman,"Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches.
"
13,12,Kyle,"Yes.
"
4,11,Stan,"...they've killed Kenny!
"
2,12,Cartman,"What is this? Halt!  It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!
"
11,4,Butters,"Awwwww.
"
9,6,Butters,"Of course. That's it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!
"
2,3,Stan,"No, we just fake it to shut him up.
"
7,6,Stan,"Jesus! They're gonna kill her!
"
14,10,Stan,"Ohhhhhhh.
"
4,10,Stan,"No??
"
11,8,Kyle,"I'm sorry.
"
6,9,Cartman,"Wow.
"
4,14,Mr. Garrison,"Alright, see you next year, parents. 
"
1,5,Cartman,"Nobody's splicin' nothing from Fluffy!
"
5,4,Cartman,"I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies...  After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili.  Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott?  I call it, ""Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili.""
"
16,12,Stan,"It's all right, just a scratch.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Not with me, man.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Oh-- Noooo!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Have Butters kiss it.
"
1,4,Stan,"Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he is smart.
"
1,3,Stan,"Cartman always makes stuff up, Ned. You can't believe anything he says.
"
12,1,Cartman,"I'm sorry for giving you AIDS, Kyle.
"
16,4,Kyle,"Alright, alright! Knock it off! Stop spreading lies.
"
4,14,Timmy,"GOBBLES! 
"
15,14,Butters,"So then I crossed that with all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids' parents actually made the least amount of money last year.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
5,3,Kyle,"I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too.
"
6,14,Stan,"The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!
"
9,9,Stan,"Ho-Hold on on guys. We're not sure what this device is capable of. Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.
"
15,8,Stan,"Yeah.
"
1,1,Cartman,"Well, I was standing out in a field, and I had this huge satellite dish sticking out of my butt. And then there were... hundreds of cows and aliens, and then I went up on the ship and Scott Baio gave me pinkeye.
"
7,2,Stan,"Look, dude. Christopher Reeve, dude. 
"
7,2,Kyle,"Yup. I'm not seeing anything.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Ye-heah!
"
5,11,Randy,"Well,  it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle.
"
2,18,Kyle,"I can't believe he's gone.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Huh?
"
18,9,Cartman,"Hey hey, how's it going, bros? This is CartmanBrah. CartmaaanBrah. And uhh, we are, it looks like we are at the bus stop now.  Yep, there's Kyle, Stan andn Kenny looking stupid as ever.
"
3,14,Butters,"Uh-uh, wuh-I ain't supposed to tell you that. If I told you that, well, why I'd be a, a no-good Yankee son of a bitch.
"
16,8,Butters,"DAD! Hey Dad!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
3,14,Cartman,"God, I hate you guys!
"
11,4,Butters,"Oh hey Eric.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah, it's a purity ring.)
"
6,4,Kyle,"Don't give him anything!
"
7,13,Cartman,"I don't idolize you anymore, asshole! 
"
11,14,Wendy,"You've compromised everything! Our lists' integrity!
"
6,12,Cartman,"AH! 
"
3,12,Kyle,"Of course, dumbass, it's Halloween.
"
6,16,Butters,"Wait right here, Stan. I warn you: you may not like what you're about to see. 
"
5,3,Kyle,"We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four....
"
3,14,Randy,"Come on, boys! 
"
16,12,Randy,"You're gonna love it, Sharon. It is in pristine condition.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"That was not me, that was Mr. Hat! 
"
3,15,Stan,"AAAA! 
"
16,8,Stan,"The school said they're the most dangerous plays, so they don't have us do 'em anymore.
"
7,5,Cartman,"EHAGH!  Moooooommmm! 
"
15,14,Cartman,"That's kewl! Whatever Kyel! Must be nice having everything you want! 
"
2,18,Stan,"Gorak!
"
13,1,Cartman,"Kenny.  Your girlfriend is a notorious whore. She even gave a kid named Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
"
10,4,Cartman,"Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?
"
17,9,Cartman,"God damn it, shut up!
"
15,9,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell is this?! 
"
4,8,Cartman,"You won't let me help.
"
1,3,Kyle,"Dude, it's Scuzzlebutt! Cartman wasn't lying.
"
9,11,Cartman,"That's fine, just get it out of the way...
"
11,2,Butters,"Oh, okay! 
"
9,6,Kenny,"(Me too.)
"
9,14,Randy,"Well how about four?
"
7,5,Kyle,"That does it. I'm out. 
"
7,5,Cartman,"Ms. Lopez, would you like to give Kyle a kiss?
"
10,1,Stan,"Oh Jesus, here we go.
"
4,15,Kyle,"Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
"
4,12,Stan,"Denver? 
"
11,1,Butters,"A midget?
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
8,10,Butters,"But Dad, I just wanna stay in my room-
"
8,5,Butters,"Awww, you don't need to do that, AWESOM-O. Hey, I gotta put in my suppository.  Can you help me?
"
3,13,Stan,"But the big dance is tomorrow and all the guys are gonna duct-tape him to a flagpole.
"
18,3,Randy,"Every time?
"
6,13,Kyle,"Paladin!
"
13,3,Randy,"Go on, Stanley. 
"
7,1,Kyle,"Really? What about?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Where is it? Where is it?!
"
5,9,Butters,"Huh, well, I'm just standin' around bein' a kid. Why? How come you're all wearing those spooky spaceman masks?
"
7,7,Butters,"Yeah! We dress up all our dogs in little outfits, and parade them down the street.  It'll be so adorable!
"
4,17,Butters,"Woh, ah, hey! I made a little cutout version of me, too! Ih in case you need it for your animated film.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Hmmm.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn't have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Well that's your side of it, Token, but you know Eric has his side as well. Have you thought about maybe writin' him a poem? M'kay? Write E- write Eric a poem, tell him how you feel.  You know, m'kay? Well I'm tellin' you, Token, you let it go, and he'll let it go, and it'll all be fine. Can ya?
"
11,7,Stan,"There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Hmmm.  Hmm, not bad. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Not yet, but they will be.
"
8,4,Randy,"Well then, it's about time you learned!  Put on some loose-fitting clothes and meet me in the garage!
"
8,10,Cartman,"All right!
"
12,5,Cartman,"What's the score, ese? Okay, let's go, your turn.  That's two to nothing, amigoo. 
"
2,12,Stan,"Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?
"
12,10,Cartman,"No trabajar aqui! Vaya! No pleya la musica en la promenade! No es bueno!
"
7,6,Cartman,"You're going down, Butters! You hear me?!
"
17,6,Cartman,"There! There it is right there, see? A red-headed cow. 
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Alright, I can do a lookup for the name. Uh go back. Main menu.  Oh... Damnit. Okay now, back.  Set- no, set appointment. Okay, speakers off.  Okay, uh... Okay, what is your smart name, Kyle?
"
14,7,Timmy,"Timmy!
"
3,6,Stan,"'Scuse me.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Jesus Christ, can you believe that asshole?!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Jakov!
"
2,12,Stan,"I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
"
8,2,Cartman,"Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh. '
"
10,9,Stan,"Yeah, at least one-fourth.
"
3,7,Cartman,"You're the crappiest band I have ever heard!
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. Kids, I asked you to write a paper to read aloud for the class. Now, who want to start?  M'kay, class.
"
6,10,Stan,"I don't think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Guys, meeting over here for a second?  All right you guys, we need to stay calm and just do the right thing. We have to kill Butters and bury him in Kyle's backyard.
"
11,11,Butters,"Really?
"
2,10,Randy,"Yeah, it's-it's true, he is.
"
3,6,Cartman,"That does it! I am suing you for sexual harassment!
"
2,6,Stan,"Whoa, I don't take drugs and worship Satan! That's lying!
"
2,5,Stan,"You don't?
"
16,8,Randy,"STAN?! Stan! 
"
6,4,Stan,"Tomorrow morning?  Dude, we gotta help them.
"
4,15,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. M'kay?
"
12,9,Jimmy,"Can't go too easy on her though. God forbid she actually gets in a good good punch and... beats ya.
"
5,8,Cartman,"Yes! Go away, you stupid towel! 
"
14,10,Stan,"DAD!
"
10,1,Stan,"No, he's not.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Tell her, tell her that I love her.
"
15,7,Stan,"I won't say a word.
"
14,8,Kyle,"What?!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Oh, uh, wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.
"
8,2,Kyle,"No you're not!  I read the brochure, Cartman! If you're under eighteen, you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.
"
7,10,Randy,"Shhhh!  It's okay, boys. They're gone. Let's just lay low for a minute until we can find-  AWWWW!!
"
3,16,Randy,"That's God?
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Iii'mmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy!!!
"
18,9,Randy,"Hey! That's not what my music is about! I'm not reducing myself to that!
"
16,8,Butters,"Like me!
"
6,4,Stan,"They aren't leaving.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Do you think I'm an idiot?
"
1,9,Cartman,"You're not gonna ride on Santa's sleigh 'cause you're a Jew, Kyle. 
"
7,10,Stan,"We did it! 
"
6,3,Butters,"Uh uh I can't freak strike, fellas. Ah-, I'm grounded.
"
10,7,Jimmy,"Who is your best friend?
"
15,6,Butters,"Sure.
"
12,11,Stan,"Wait, whattaya mean no?
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"What do you think, Mr. Marsh? All set to put a down payment on that baby?
"
17,7,Randy,"What is it?
"
13,7,Butters,"Oh. Uhuh sure, Galeed.
"
12,5,Kyle,"The only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of Garrison's desk! And you know it!
"
5,6,Stan,"Look, Kyle. Look. 
"
8,3,Cartman,"And as we march for The Passion we should also voice our support! So, when I say ""Es ist Zeit für Säuberung,"" you all chant back ""Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten.""
"
15,11,Randy,"Really??
"
3,12,Cartman,"""Ooh, I don't wanna dig up my dead grandma 'cause I'm such a goody-two-shoes!""  Ow.
"
1,3,Cartman,"Democrats piss me off!
"
14,5,Randy,"Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this. 
"
15,10,Cartman,"Okay okay, so what do we call Pete Melman when we see him? I was thinking, ""Poopypants Pete"", but th- but then I also thought of ""Mushpants Melman.""
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Kyle?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Hah!  It's Wednesday! It's Wednesday!  Only three more days till Casa Bonita.  Oh, that would be so bad-ass!
"
14,9,Randy,"That thing is famous? Why?
"
14,9,Randy,"Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!
"
13,8,Stan,"Woohoo!
"
7,3,Butters,"I don't know. I don't think anybody deserves that kind of brutality.
"
15,12,Butters,"Sir, all of the students already know who the 1% is.
"
6,12,Kenny,"(Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
"
18,2,Stan,"I'll be back. 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Oh, for Christ's sake!
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Wow, w-what a great audience... Knock-knock.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?
"
6,7,Stan,"Yeah, stupid.
"
13,14,Cartman,"Do I look like a minority to you, stupid?! Now look guys, I did some calculations: just last year, there were almost ninety percent normal people to minorities. That's fifty percent rise in one, year!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Nah, it's just the city and e- Oh my Jesus Christ monkeyballs.  ""Super... Phun Thyme.""  Dude, check it out! We're only two blocks from a Super Phun Thyme! They've got video games and rides and everything!
"
15,1,Cartman,"At Best Buy.
"
4,15,Stan,"For giving Howard Stern a hummer!
"
14,4,Kyle,"There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
"
5,4,Cartman,"What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? 
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"Huh-uh, nothing! Nothing! 
"
2,17,Kyle,"""And as the voluminous corporate automaton bulldozes its way through bantam America...
"
11,3,Cartman,"Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
"
13,4,Stan,"Stop it, Mom!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Well, yes, I think so.
"
18,2,Randy,"Staaaaaaan!
"
2,17,Cartman,"Yeah, that's fine.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"C-can I just get two back, please?
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Say ""hi"" to Sexual Harassment Panda!
"
13,7,Stan,"You really think he'll die in Somalia?
"
1,13,Kyle,"Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That's enough for you to do your DNA test.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Well, hi there.  Uh, wha-what are you doing tonight?
"
5,3,Stan,"Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!
"
17,6,Stan,"You should apologize to Kenny too.
"
7,5,Mr. Mackey,"That was very good, Kyle. I think the Latino Endowment Council was very happy with your presentation. Looks like you might win. 
"
5,2,Randy,"Oh, God, they're actually pulling it off.
"
4,9,Cartman,"--you're my fantasy, you fanta--
"
8,11,Stan,"Look, you guys, if Craig can do it, we can do it! Come on!  How about we do... a show... with us... ughhh.
"
5,9,Stan,"What?  Howdy. 
"
4,12,Butters,"Uh-uh, maybe we could stand like this , with our wieners pokin' through the back of our legs, you know, and give 'er a nice fruit bowl.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Pfft, apologize?!  That's not what I said, you dumb bitch. Heheh, heheh.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Let's just go over here so we can hear ourselves better.  Lord, Father in Heaven, we thank you for all your blessings and we... 
"
6,5,Kyle,"Oh Jesus! Now where do we go??
"
6,11,Stan,"Child Tracker?
"
16,12,Stan,"Wait a minute. There they are!
"
8,1,Stan,"Butters!
"
3,17,Kyle,"How about... finkleroy?
"
6,1,Cartman,"Hello?
"
8,12,Butters,"My name's Butters.
"
1,8,Stan,"It was my mom's credit card.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"""That guy with the really big head.""
"
9,5,Randy,"Can you believe it, Stan? State Championship game. It's... the greatest thing ever.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Alright Jimmy, see ya. 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Cool!
"
4,6,Cartman,"No! I mean, what the hell are you doing?! Why are all my mature adult friends being ""mys-teriously"" arrested, huh?! 
"
13,8,Kyle,"Yeah!
"
18,2,Kyle,"Oh! Tha-oh, yeah, the the startup company thing didn't really work out.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Dude, that was Star Trek again.
"
3,16,Stan,"Hello?
"
14,8,Butters,"You're givin' away all your money??
"
14,7,Kyle,"Please, sir.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Look! My gang, which I can't talk about because it's super secret, is the most important thing to me now! And if you two don't like it, you can just pass the blunt to the nigga on your left. 
"
2,9,Stan,"Are they good?
"
2,9,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
9,5,Stan,"I know we can lose if we try.
"
14,1,Kyle,"Stop it! Stop!  Oh God! Oh God, help us!
"
4,12,Stan,"Thah... That's what Mr. Garrison would've said.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Jimmy, you've always been my favorite standup comic. You've gotta help me. I've lost my sense of humor.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Damnit! 
"
10,7,Cartman,"Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started.
"
2,17,Kyle,"We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
"
7,4,Cartman,"You know. If I have a flashback, then I can see what 1776 was like first-hand!
"
11,5,Randy,"Dammit.
"
1,13,Stan,"I said: We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch.
"
11,13,Stan,"Really? That'd be sweet.
"
18,3,Stan,"Well you said you knew a guy at work who was Lorde's uncle.
"
13,11,Randy,"MEMEME. I wanna kiss it! I wanna kiss it!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Step out of the car, please, sir.
"
5,10,Butters,"I'm not makin' a face, mom!
"
17,6,Cartman,"Huh? You comin'? 
"
1,7,Mr. Garrison,"Okay now, all you little Chewbaccas take your seats.  Children, since today is Halloween, I thought we should learn something about the great horror writer, Jackie Collins. You see, when Jackie Collins first wrote her novel- 
"
1,10,Kyle,"Damn, what a freak!
"
3,15,Cartman,"...play stupid games.
"
5,2,Randy,"Alright, boys, we're gonna head to the bar. We'll be back to pick you up at nine.
"
4,17,Cartman,"What?!
"
16,12,Randy,"Well? There she is.  It's a new beginning for us! 
"
2,7,Cartman,"What do you think it is?
"
15,13,Kyle,"Alright, fine! Let's just get this stupid report over with!
"
12,6,Randy,"What?! 
"
2,16,Stan,"Yeah. Or, we could not.
"
2,4,Kyle,"No, Mom-uh, he, he doesn't want you kissing him. 
"
9,4,Kyle,"Wow, level nine already? Dude, you kick ass in ""Heaven versus Hell.""
"
3,12,Kyle,"Somebody took my dead grandma.
"
18,4,Randy,"Did you see that?! Oh!
"
13,12,Randy,"Fags! 
"
3,6,Stan,"Well, we don't take kindly to you!
"
1,11,Stan,"Yeah, that one!
"
6,2,Stan,"Thanks. Who are you?
"
17,7,Kyle,"I know.
"
10,2,Randy,"You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
"
3,14,Randy,"Oh, my head.
"
10,4,Cartman,"Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable.  Let this be our final battle.  Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah!  Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!
"
16,11,Kenny,"With the war at an end, our Butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony. And with any help from the gods, become his old cheery self again.
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Jesus Christ. 
"
10,14,Stan,"No- dude, I told you I can't do that.
"
1,8,Stan,"Wow, it sucks he has to leave.
"
16,6,Stan,"Stop it! It was me! My idea.
"
6,3,Stan,"But, that's not fair! That means Butters gets to go and we don't!
"
2,13,Stan,"But can he still ride a bull?
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's settle down!  Huhh I mean it; I want quiet!  My God, Mr. Hat, these children are so boring on Ritalin.  Huh, ah! Alright, children, today we're gonna learn about human reproduction. What do you think about that?!  Vaginas, and penises. Butt sex.  Well, dammit, Eric, don't you have some smartass thing to say?!
"
9,4,Cartman,"Mom! Mom! Get up, we have to go!  MOM, GET UP!
"
2,4,Stan,"Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad.
"
13,8,Kyle,"What?
"
5,4,Stan,"Oh my God, he killed Kenny.
"
17,2,Cartman,"Boo, Wendy, Boooooo! Boo Wendy.
"
16,13,Cartman,"...Fuck! Dude, weak. 
"
17,10,Wendy,"And I'm your captain, Wendy! 
"
2,10,Kenny,"(Aa-choo!)
"
4,9,Randy,"Stanley, what the hell are you doing?
"
16,4,Cartman,"It's so cool that even though I'm Christian I celebrate Passover too! Yup. I think both holidays are awesome.  I really sympathize with those Jews in Ancient Egypt! I really do! 
"
13,14,Stan,"I'm gonna go on the slides.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Yeah.  And Jason has freckles, and Billy Turner has narrow shoulders.  The cheerleaders? Bebe has acne. Lola's arms are too short. Nicole's eyes are puffy. Annie has thin hair.  And Heidi Turner's butt is flat!  Oh God damn it!
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Well, who cares about a guy that makes beer?! Jesus Christ, I'm trying to teach history!
"
6,10,Stan,"Ahah
"
5,14,Mr. Garrison,"Well, that's four fingers; try five.
"
11,2,Cartman,"You ready?
"
14,8,Kyle,"Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Clearly, something's going on.
"
4,14,Wendy,"I know! How about, instead of a dog, Helen Keller has a pet turkey.
"
9,8,Stan,"Kyle, it... it isn't global warming.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
3,15,Stan,"I'll try again.
"
9,6,Butters,"But I saw him! Just as plain as I'm seein' you right now!
"
16,14,Butters,"Red Lobster!
"
4,9,Randy,"What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
"
5,1,Cartman,"So, guess what they're gonna say tonight on that show, Cop Drama.
"
18,9,Mr. Garrison,"I don't- I don't even understand what's happening.
"
7,4,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You're suppsoed to be studying! 
"
11,10,Kyle,"Dude.
"
18,5,Cartman,"It's just Kenny. Like we're not gonna tell Kenny we have a fucking drone! Come on, Butters! Alright, come on, guys. I think I have this thing figured out.  Dude, no way! This thing is so epic! 
"
16,2,Cartman,"For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect.
"
17,2,Stan,"Yhh, yeah, the first grader?
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play ""John the Fisherman""? 
"
3,10,Kyle,"Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
"
16,10,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, you've always taught me that being direct and honest is a basic Jewish tenet.
"
14,3,Randy,"Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?
"
9,14,Stan,"... I'm eight!
"
4,14,Stan,"E-yes. Perhaps she should go to an asyluh.
"
1,1,Cartman,"Puh!
"
5,7,Randy,"Beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company!  Ah I mean, ever! Beating off the dog is not appropriate ever!
"
11,6,Kyle,"He catches the feesh so, then he can make money.
"
7,12,Cartman,"Yeah! Go Stan! Go Stan!  All right, I've got five bucks on the other kid. Who wants in?
"
18,10,Kyle,"Wow.  Well that's awesome!
"
9,6,Kyle,"God, this is gonna be sooo yummy.
"
6,7,Butters,"How are things... oing with your new best friend?
"
6,7,Cartman,"Yeah, and the sweet thing is, this stupid asshole didn't even charge me money for it. He just made me close my eyes and suck it out of a hose. Heh.  There we go. 
"
7,8,Kyle,"Hey guys. You wanna throw the football around?
"
3,6,Stan,"Wwhat do you mean?
"
16,5,Butters,"I just...  don't want you to pick on me no more, Grandma.
"
3,3,Stan,"That's nice. Look Chef, Cartman's got this eye doctor, see, and he- Girlfriend?!
"
3,3,Cartman,"I am a little piggy. Ey!  That does it! Mom!
"
6,15,Stan,"No wait.
"
1,9,Kyle,"Is it illegal for Jewish people to eat Christmas snow?
"
4,11,Cartman,"Praise the Lord-uh!
"
5,8,Stan,"We just have to try and make the day go as fast as possible so we can get back to GameSphere. 
"
3,8,Butters,"Uhuh, they're gonna burn us up and act like nothin' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Kick the baby! 
"
14,4,Cartman,"Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!
"
18,6,Butters,"Well, it's just 49 cents for the cheapest one. 
"
9,14,Randy,"That means... I'm not cured. I still have the disease!  Bartender! I need a drink! Three shots of McAllen, two small bottles of vodka, three bottles of beer and some Jell-O shooters!  Come ON! Let's GO!
"
2,18,Stan,"You're... home. 
"
4,6,Cartman,"Just go, Butters. We're running out of time.
"
12,8,Butters,"Huh?
"
13,5,Cartman,"What are you?
"
6,10,Wendy,"But, then the mall closes at four or five o'clock, so who knows w-
"
11,10,Kyle,"Who are you?
"
12,13,Kyle,"Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too.
"
18,2,Wendy,"You're... back?
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Sure, go ahead. It's a-it's a party, isn't it? Mkahy?
"
14,4,Stan,"No. NO! Screw this! You know what? ""Edit Profile &gt; Update Profile."" There! ""Delete Profile""!  ""You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel"" Proceed!  ""Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No."" Yes! ""Are you totally sure?"" Yes! 
"
8,1,Kyle,"Butters! He got a ninja star stuck in his eye, and we were taking him to the vet when you fucked it all up! Butters!
"
12,6,Stan,"What the hell?
"
17,8,Cartman,"Paladin Butters, I was hoping I could talk to you about Lady McCormick
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Hello? Hello? I need to put my ...p-penis in a woman's vagina. Any takers?  Excuse me, ma'am. What's your name?
"
6,10,Stan,"Hoh? Ahta.  Ahta.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Token, I swear to God, if you call me fat one more time  I'm gonna smack you on the head with this rock! 
"
4,1,Kyle,"What the hell are they doing?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Mom! MOOOM! Mom!  Seriously! Something wonderful has happened!
"
1,1,Stan,"I do not!
"
16,10,Cartman,"Sorry about this.
"
16,13,Stan,"Everyone hates me now, and it isn't fair.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Yeah. Boy, am I glad to see you, Ike.
"
6,14,Stan,"Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body.
"
1,2,Kenny,"(How big's your penis, Chef?)
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Oh I sure have. I've been working on my ruh... ruh... routine all year long
"
7,9,Cartman,"Who fuckin' cares, Token?! I could never beat Kyle now! I'll say it again! Fuck Jesus! 
"
6,12,Kyle,"Yeah. Good job, fatass! 
"
6,10,Stan,"Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?
"
2,15,Cartman,"Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!
"
17,8,Butters,"Oh. Okay, thanks.
"
3,12,Stan,"There she is!
"
1,7,Cartman,"Heyy. They're all dressed up like ghosts too.  One Tootie Bar? You cheap bastards!
"
4,17,Kyle,"-And I'll stand. 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.
"
12,8,Cartman,"I didn't sign up for this! You take your American Liberation Front and you shove it up your ass.  That's it. Kill me. Do whatever. I can no longer conscionably be a part of the American Liberation Front.
"
15,7,Kyle,"You don't wanna eat it?
"
4,6,Cartman,"What the hell?  Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?! This is for mature people only!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Testing, testing, 1 2.  Sweet. 
"
2,9,Cartman,"Oh my God.
"
9,14,Stan,"Sure, whatever dude.
"
2,3,Stan,"It's cool, dude. We'll help you.
"
1,3,Cartman,"No! A piece of celery.
"
3,12,Cartman,"U-hi think that's a sweet idea!
"
2,15,Stan,"Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor.
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, so what other sexual positions have we talked about? Yeah, the wrap-around butt grab. Sure, can't forget that. Uh huh, reverse cowgirl. Good, Kevin. Hot Lunch, sure, she likes that. Donkey Punch, uh huh. Glass-bottom boat. Good one, yes. Fish-eye. Good, Jenny. Chili dog. Mm-hm.
"
13,12,Cartman,"Yeah, everyone hates those fags, right?
"
6,17,Kyle,"Well come on! We gotta tell you what happened. I'm sure glad it's over with. 
"
6,12,Cartman,"Listen, lady! You've got to get this crap out of me!  I don't want him in me anymore! Just suck him up and throw him out!
"
11,9,Stan,"Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?
"
4,12,Cartman,"Yeah, if there's a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!
"
9,9,Butters,"Oh uh, hi Mom.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Oh, God! I'm so bored! Somebody help me! 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Uh... now ending fart sequence.
"
7,15,Cartman,"Well now you're gonna get it, motherfucker! That's right! You and me! Right now!  We're havin' it out! Let's go! Come on! Come on!!  Mooooooom! Moooooooom!
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Just time to prepare, nurse. Just time.  Mkay?
"
12,8,Cartman,"You and me: we're going to be the brave little boys who fought back, Butters. We are not letting them take over our country. Fuck the Chinese.
"
3,17,Stan,"No! That we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole New Yorker kids.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Wow, a commercial?
"
1,5,Kyle,"He's my new pet elephant.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Kick his nutsack! 
"
8,9,Randy,"You see boys, if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies, we all have to be willing to... pay a little bit more. Do you understand?
"
7,11,Kyle,"Nah, I can't. We should help look for him.
"
18,8,Butters,"Dangit, I wish I knew people.
"
1,13,Cartman,"Eeyy!!
"
2,16,Stan,"Do you really think we should go with this guy?
"
5,13,Cartman,"It's been proven, Jew! I saw it on 3-2-1 Contact. With all the research that's going on, stem cells are worth three times their weight in gold. What I have in my back yard is an aborted treasure chest.
"
12,3,Cartman,"He's cheesing his fucking balls off, dude.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Those weren't our dick sizes?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hahahahahaaaha!  I got you kinda! I got you kinda!
"
17,10,Wendy,"She's a little overweight, but that's pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade!
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage.  Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage .
"
7,1,Kyle,"It's just sending images of cities and people and stuff.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Okay, Kyle, you're being a Negative Nancy. Stop it. Eh, unless you want everyone to call you Negative Nancy from now on.  Now, what we need is to all chip in four dollars, and we can have them here tomorrow!
"
8,6,Stan,"Dude, are these all your toys?
"
6,3,Butters,"They sure do. They always say to me, ""Butters, you're not Kenny."" But I never said I was Kenny. They say Kenny would do this and Kenny would do that-
"
16,11,Butters,"Double wow! 
"
3,1,Cartman,"God-damned stupid hippie activist! I should be home nestled in the couch with my Mr. Kitty right now watching Fat Abbot cartoons and eat-  Yes! I knew it! I'm saved! 
"
11,11,Butters,"WAAAA! It's Alien!  Predator! Wha?  Huh?  WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! 
"
3,3,Kyle,"Now, Cartman!! 
"
1,5,Kyle,"What the hell would you know you fat sweaty Mongoloid, you never get higher than a 'D'!
"
16,2,Stan,"Grandpa.
"
15,9,Butters,"Boy, I'm so glad I proved I'm a good Meheecan! Hey, maybe next time I can be team leader!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"We sure do. Thanks, Mr. Apple...b-by.
"
10,6,Cartman,"No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead.
"
6,8,Cartman,"You guys, you guys!  I took Kyle's twenty dollars down to the bank again, and I got it changed into quarters!
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"I don't know what the Goddamned problem is. Maybe you all don't know serious tooth decay is, maybe you all just don't give a fuck. You all probably think you can live your lives cavity-free, m'kay, never givin' two shits about the plaque that's building on your teeth. Kyle, you have single-handedly destroyed all that which I worked on for the past six years. And so I want you to know, Kyle, once and for all, why this whole ""dental hygiene"" thing is so important to me.  Two years ago, I lost my father to tooth decay. M'kay? He was an intelligent, hard-workin' man, and my whole family watched as tooth decay took him in the blink of an eye! You've been told to brush and to floss, but do you really know the importance behind it?!  DO YOU?!
"
9,10,Stan,"Jesus Christ!
"
9,4,Kyle,"How can they let an eight-year-old decide Kenny's fate?
"
1,13,Stan,"How's it going, Cartman?
"
1,2,Cartman,"Hey, I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!  Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh.
"
6,5,Stan,"O-K, deal.
"
3,14,Stan,"Alright alright. Let's just try it again. 1-2-3-4. 
"
8,9,Kyle,"All Wall-Marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back.
"
5,6,Stan,"You'd better not be lying, Kenny. 
"
18,7,Kyle,"Oh. Ah, we're trying to reach Oculus Customer Service.
"
11,4,Kyle,"Yeah. Actually, there is.
"
10,2,Kyle,"Hey Stan.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Boy band.
"
15,10,Kyle,"It wouldn't be funny if that Web site posted something about you!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
"
13,10,Kyle,"Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this.
"
18,1,Butters,"Washington Redskins. Go fuck yourself.
"
15,11,Randy,"Same as you guys. Trying to get men lengthier, better-quality blowjobs.
"
14,6,Mr. Garrison,"Eric I,  I'm really sorry that you were put through all this.
"
10,13,Kyle,"I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!
"
2,3,Stan,"A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond.
"
10,14,Stan,"Tie? Well, what does that mean?
"
1,4,Stan,"I'm not playing.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Really?  Hey, there's a frozen guy down there.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end.  Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it. 
"
5,7,Stan,"But Wendy, we don't understand how that-
"
2,12,Wendy,"Stan, can I talk to you for a second?  Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe?
"
5,4,Stan,"He's lying. 
"
17,10,Cartman,"Whoa, look at Bebe!  I had no idea Bebe was that hot.
"
11,8,Kyle,"All right, then we go with the plan. Just like ""To Catch A Predator"".  The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Eeyy!
"
9,13,Kyle,"Jambu! Jambu, why didn't you speak up before?
"
3,12,Cartman,"U-huh, nice costume, Kenny. If you think you're gonna win with that, huh!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Interesting, and why is it called Passover again? 
"
9,8,Mr. Mackey,"So does, does this mean the storm is past. Global warming's over?
"
8,10,Stan,"No!
"
6,6,Butters,"Our reign of terror is complete! Our tur- turmoil has now come full circle!  Hey, is the hose on full, General Disarray? 
"
9,10,Cartman,"I broke the egg.
"
14,8,Stan,"Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can.
"
3,6,Stan,"Uh... I'm eight?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Alright Butters, sit down at the computer.  Now drop the suppornity window! We're just gonna make it!
"
10,14,Stan,"Hello?
"
5,8,Stan,"Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.
"
1,5,Kyle,"Come on Kenny.
"
15,11,Randy,"To be honest, I'm just here for the blowjob. From what I heard I figured the show must be really sexy and hot, but... I just don't see it happening.
"
3,2,Kyle,"""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?"" That was Wrath of Khan.
"
4,9,Kyle,"Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. 
"
2,18,Stan,"His name is Gorak!
"
8,1,Butters,"Ah.  Hwa!  Hwaaaaa!
"
2,6,Stan,"Okay. Action! 
"
11,7,Stan,"Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!
"
15,7,Stan,"No.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Uuf.
"
14,9,Kyle,"Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
"
4,4,Cartman,"That was awesuhome!
"
10,8,Stan,"Whoever he is, he is one tough badass.
"
9,6,Cartman,"What did I do to deserve this?!  How can my own God forsake me?! Am I doomed to wander the Earth alone for all eternity?!
"
6,13,Jimmy,"Hey fellas, mind if we take a little re-rest?
"
5,1,Kyle,"There's no sand in my vagina!!!
"
15,11,Randy,"Hey. Wait a minute. Why not bring Broadway to South Park?
"
13,3,Stan,"Yeah, I think I get it.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Wu-we don't really ""need"" the ticket stub, do we?
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Now, come on! Is that any way to talk?
"
12,1,Butters,"Okay, but... what are you going to do?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!
"
6,3,Butters,"The union? Oh, that's why you came?
"
18,8,Randy,"Alright, come on up here.  What's your name?
"
14,2,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. 
"
11,7,Stan,"Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. 
"
12,11,Randy,"Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my Gohhhd!
"
7,9,Kyle,"Judas Priest.  Wow! Downloading music for free is awesome! 
"
18,8,Kyle,"It doesn't even look like they're open. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"I dunno!  Try ""strangetamer.""
"
15,9,Cartman,"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 
"
12,3,Cartman,"But you know, we've all learned something, you guys. We can never persecute living beings and force them into hiding. It's wrong. 
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Half the kids in the class didn't vote for your nephew, so what about them? You don't give a crap about them because they're not on your side! People like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time, but when it comes to Middle America, you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment! Well, just because you're on TV doesn't mean you know crap about the government! Now get your ass back on first class and respect this class's right to make up their own minds!  ...Oh, sorry I got a little off the subject, kids.
"
10,8,Cartman,"We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.
"
2,18,Stan,"Could we be best friends again?  I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
"
14,5,Stan,"Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...
"
4,9,Butters,"Ahah-oo well, alright then. 
"
12,3,Kyle,"I'm not cheesing. I've never cheesed once in my life.
"
6,4,Butters,"Good night, Patches. Good night, Halloway. Good night, Nepture. Good night, Davis. Good night, Bud. Good night, Red. Good night, Paulette. Good night, Chastity.
"
6,13,Randy,"Boys! Boys!  Where's the videotape?
"
16,11,Butters,"Surrender?! No, the heck with that!
"
10,8,Randy,"Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Hey, yeah! I almost forgot.
"
8,3,Stan,"I'm not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he's gonna- 
"
3,14,Cartman,"Yeah. Can I get some of those animal cookies? Those frosty ones with the sprinkles on 'em.
"
18,2,Cartman,"You know what I'mm gonna miss most? Pancakes. I keep having dreams of Aunt Jemima. She's trying to tell me something. But then she just fades away.
"
1,11,Wendy,"Maybe we should go on a cruise or something. 
"
3,2,Randy,"You're right, Stanley. You're absolutely right.  Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book.
"
18,2,Wendy,"You couldn't put on the party you were hoping to put on, was that it?
"
6,5,Cartman,"Alright, we'll have to play for it. How about... if your name is Butters, you have to go. Okay, so what's your name? 
"
3,1,Cartman,"Why?
"
2,11,Kyle,"Did what?
"
13,7,Cartman,"That's true. Well, I'm glad you've finally come to terms with your disability, Kyle.  Gentlemen, I'm off to start planning! 
"
3,4,Kyle,"Well, everyone in the world thinks you are. See ya. 
"
8,10,Stan,"Yeah, yeah. We play Fireman all the time.
"
9,6,Kyle,"Hello?? I've been saying this for years!
"
3,6,Stan,"Somebody told us they saw a big panda bear in here.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Dude, check it out: for picture day, Kenny got into his parka backwards, so that his ass shows through his hood. Look! . Kenny, Kenny, over here! 
"
14,8,Butters,"Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side.  You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Butters, you have to help me!
"
1,6,Stan,"My grampa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Ike, you can't come to school with me. 
"
18,5,Cartman,"Kenny has no idea what you're talking about, dude.
"
6,10,Stan,"Yeah, and then you can actually hold it like this. Now-
"
2,13,Kyle,"You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
"
5,3,Kyle,"Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p... player hatin'.  The gang wrote a song about it. Why don't we listen in?
"
8,3,Kyle,"Wait. That's it. Atonement. Of course.  I know what I have to do now. Thank you, Father. 
"
2,18,Kyle,"Sick, dude! 
"
14,14,Randy,"Yeah, it's fuckin' money.
"
10,4,Cartman,"Sir! Sir!  If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you.  Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge.
"
8,9,Cartman,"Whoa, awesome!
"
10,12,Mr. Mackey,"M, m'kay. Ya-you realize evolution has been pretty much uhhh... proven.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Uhhh, the trademark got pulled so I'm totaly free to use the name, actually.  Um, Butters, could you get that?
"
6,16,Cartman,"Marrado. Spectacularrr.
"
12,13,Cartman,"You shouldn't pick on kids with diabetes, that's not cool. I'm Scott Malkinson.
"
13,11,Stan,"Dude, fuck you!
"
5,4,Kyle,"Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Okay Mommy. Mamamama.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Hahahahahaha. Hey, you guys, I can see Kenny's pengling, hahahahahaha.
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah, we did. 
"
4,7,Cartman,"But I don't want Kyle to get well. I hate Kyle.
"
6,7,Butters,"Aha! Ahaha! Ahahahaha!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Naw uh, 'cause my house got burned down, so everyone has to feel bad for me.  What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!
"
11,5,Randy,"Just hand over the bunny, Stan!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. 
"
7,14,Kyle,"Well. Dude, it's uh it's good to have you back.
"
8,4,Randy,"All right son, dancing is all about a frame of mind. Now, I'm not telling you to go around challenging other kids to dance, but when they challenge you, you just look 'em straight in the eye, and give 'em this.  Come on, Stan.  ...six, seven, eight. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Goddamnit, get me down from here! 
"
9,2,Mr. Mackey,"Uh huh hi Eric, uh, how's it goin'?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Okay.
"
7,11,Cartman,"You have AIDS?
"
11,4,Kyle,"The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"For the last time, my name is not Garrison-san, all right?! And this is not Hat-san! And you all better start talking in a manner that I can understand!
"
4,17,Cartman,"I AM NOT THAT GODDAMNED FAT! 
"
16,12,Randy,"Arrrg!  Hey, what are you doing?!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Noooo! 
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes! Yes I will!
"
2,5,Kyle,"Wow, that was easy.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Eh it's ""Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow."" I taped it last month.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Well, I don't see any crocs out here.
"
18,3,Randy,"Well, my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined.
"
16,12,Randy,"Oh I get it. Blockbuster's so old it's creepy! Haha! Nobody rents movies anymore!  People just don't know we're open yet!
"
6,7,Butters,"He did? Hawww, heck. I thought I was bein' original.
"
18,7,Stan,"No, listen, I called Customer Service because I need help! 
"
12,13,Wendy,"Hey Stan.
"
3,8,Randy,"Hell, we should get in.
"
16,8,Randy,"All right all right, here we go boys! Watch them on the kickoff, all right? Special teams are the most important plays.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Craig's. a-and Clyde's. Oh and and Kyle's, but that was a freebie. Look, I run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers, charts, and technology. Look around you. I know how it feels to be really, really pissed off at your parents. And I will work hard, for you. 
"
11,4,Kyle,"What? Why?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Kyle, what are you doing here?
"
12,1,Kyle,"...What?!
"
5,10,Kyle,"...You put Kenny's picture on a milk carton??
"
7,4,Stan,"Just face it, Cartman. You're gonna have to study!
"
5,6,Kenny,"(Because! His grandmother just died and her will says Cartman now has a million dollars!)
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"No you didn't! No you didn't!
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Yes, I agree. I think Craig is a thousand times as cool as Clyde. There doesn't really seem to be a doubt.)
"
7,5,Kyle,"Aw, God-dammit!
"
6,13,Kyle,"But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"It's obvious where all the talent in that family went!
"
1,9,Stan,"'Cause I looked in my parents' closet last night.
"
18,9,Kyle,"All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh my God. Spaaace caaash. 
"
8,7,Randy,"Oh my God!  Stan Marsh, how dare you use that time-bashing slur?!
"
10,1,Cartman,"Excuse me?
"
3,15,Cartman,"...play stupid games.
"
2,3,Stan,"Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"No-uho-uho-uho!  Not o-uho-uhokay!
"
3,17,Cartman,"That's a scientific term for crapping your pants.
"
1,13,Stan,"Dude. We should be videotaping this. We could make another $10,000.
"
6,4,Cartman,"""Captain, we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads?""
"
16,7,Cartman,"Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?
"
2,2,Stan,"I'm gotta get outta here!
"
6,3,Kyle,"Cool!
"
7,14,Butters,"Hey Lexus.
"
1,4,Stan,"Atta boy Spark, get her.  Yes!  Ah crap! Now what do I do?
"
1,1,Stan,"Dude! Visitors!
"
7,14,Cartman,"Omigod! You guys... this is the greatest place in the world... 
"
5,3,Kyle,"What have you done, Cartman?!
"
10,3,Stan,"To Los Angeles?
"
1,7,Kenny,"(Heeeeyyyy, kick ass)  (Ow!) 
"
15,14,Cartman,"Aww, my mom is so poor she walked down the road with one shoooe.  And if you ask her if she lost a shoe, she'd say ""No, I found ooone.""
"
16,13,Butters,"He's the one person who doesn't do stuff like that! Why don't you leave him alone!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Sick! I felt it on my face!
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Well, what did you think?
"
1,13,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, well, there's a news flash!
"
18,9,Cartman,"Stan is such a douchebag. He just agrees with Kyle no matter what.
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Shut your hole, Mr. Hat!
"
16,4,Kyle,"What does that have to do with Passover?
"
2,7,Stan,"Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on.
"
3,8,Stan,"You did? 
"
12,11,Stan,"'Cause just, that, that's just the way it is.
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"All right kids, go ahead and visit the charming villagers and learn stuff.  Keep track of your partner!
"
7,9,Stan,"Dude, I didn't know being in a band was gonna be this tough.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
8,8,Stan,"No, I think voting is great, but, if I have to choose between a douche and a turd, I just don't see the point.
"
12,10,Cartman,"Hey! Heyheyheyheyhey! 
"
8,3,Stan,"Awww crap, he's only got twenties! You got two dollars, Kenny? 
"
18,10,Cartman,"I'm sure this is exactly how Kurt Cobain would want to be remembered.
"
17,2,Kyle,"So you know it.
"
2,6,Mr. Mackey,"Shh! M'kay?
"
5,8,Stan,"What is it, Mom?
"
4,17,Kyle,"What?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Aw, it's about freaking time, jackass! 
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Chef, can I talk to you?
"
4,13,Stan,"You did it, Kyle!  Kyle saved your life, fat ass!
"
14,3,Randy,"Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?
"
9,13,Stan,"They're on their way, Manuel. Is the rocket gonna be ready?
"
13,14,Butters,"Oh b-hoy, the waves are startin' up again!
"
18,8,Kyle,"It was seriously about the greatest night of our lives.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Then you know what it says happens to those who don't follow the Lord-uh.
"
2,9,Stan,"Mr. Garrison?
"
12,9,Wendy,"You don't get it, asshole!  There is nothing you can do to stop this fight! I am going to wipe the playground with you right in front of everyone! I am going to shove your ass down your throat and make you eat your underwear!
"
9,13,Kyle,"But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.
"
17,8,Kyle,"Cartman released the PS4s Cartman. They're being reviewed. People are liking them.
"
7,6,Stan,"Hey, you buttholes can't play FBI here!
"
8,14,Kyle,"Goddammit, Cartman!
"
6,17,Stan,"Yeah, but I feel like things are finally back to normal.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Well, I did a lot of thinking. And you know, guys, there's an important lesson I think we've all learned. What do we do when the tables are turned?
The day's looking brighter. Gray skies are turning blue.
'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not) the poor kid at school!
Kenny's back and it's such a thrill. Now I'm rich just like Stan and Kiul!
All that matters is no one thinks I'm a tool! 'Cause I'm not (He's not, he's not)
That's right, the poor kid in school.
Sing it with me, guys!
He's not the poor kid in school. (He's not)
I'm not-
"
14,5,Cartman,"I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad.
"
7,8,Cartman,"We have no choice, you guys. We're just gonna have to kill Kyle.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Yeah dude. I'm sorry.
"
1,3,Stan,"My Uncle Jimbo says that after this, he's gonna take me hunting in Africa.
"
10,9,Kyle,"Dude, we aren't going to kill you. 
"
14,3,Cartman,"No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!
"
13,13,Butters,"Cool, thanks.
"
4,14,Cartman,"I know, I know, but listen: Uh, let me try to explain the position I'm in here. The retarded turkey belongs to our friend, Timmy. And Timmy's the only person who knows the part of Helen Keller. So, so tell me what I can do here to make everybody happy?
"
9,13,Kyle,"Well you're NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.
"
13,2,Kyle,"Whoa, what the?
"
4,1,Kyle,"But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes . For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Uh, hold on just a second! I believe we discussed the little matter of my payment?!  I'm not letting you guys screw me over again. Give me what I wanted, now!
"
17,6,Cartman,"Thank you everyone. It's my honor to have been a part of this... miracle. Isn't that right, Fartboy?
"
14,4,Cartman,"This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Get the rest of the stuff you guys!
"
7,9,Stan,"Kenny's right. We should download some Judas Priest, too.
"
8,1,Stan,"Nothing, just... playing.
"
18,8,Kyle,"Then he's perfect for us.
"
3,14,Kyle,"You've got to stop, Dad. If the South wins, me and Stan have to be Cartman's slaves!
"
15,8,Stan,"Adam Sandler's funny.
"
12,14,Kyle,"Nah, dude. Are you on America's side, Stan? 
"
17,2,Randy,"I wish I could! I wish I could live with Jaden Smith so I could be rich and I wouldn't have to live in a boring sexless marriage where all your mom and I do piss each other off!  Oh crap.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Uh-huh-  Oho! Ohoho.
"
11,14,Cartman,"Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can outthink them.
"
7,11,Cartman,"What isn't it?
"
1,1,Stan,"Sorry.
"
3,2,Kyle,"God, that was not cool at all, dude!
"
16,13,Stan,"Go ahead and test it! Then let's just see what happens to this money-hungry, alcoholic prostitute!
"
6,7,Stan,"Okay, now put on the nose, Tweek. 
"
6,13,Randy,"There you are!
"
13,11,Cartman,"Sir, we actually don't give two shits about you killing whales. Can we go?
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey look! There's a taxi! 
"
8,8,Kyle,"Look, it may not seem important now, but your vote really does count, and we all have to do our part.
"
4,4,Randy,"Wasn't that great, son?
"
6,15,Cartman,"Hey Kenny! Shut up, Kenny! You shut up, fatass!
"
5,13,Kyle,"He said Madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago, and that now she suddenly speaks with a British accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself. 
"
3,12,Cartman,"Mom! You got the new Duffy's catalog! I-I'm gonna circle everything I want for Christmas, okay? Mom? Okay? O-kay , let's see.  I waant... thiis... aand... this...  and...  let's see, comes with so...  ...comes with two bars , so there we go, have that...  and, let's see...
"
2,14,Cartman,"See? I told you guys it would work.
"
11,1,Randy,"Yeah. Hi, everybody watching in South Park!
"
1,7,Cartman,"Can we have some candy now please?!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Cool.
"
6,2,Stan,"Oh,. God. 
"
12,5,Cartman,"Maybe he's right. I'd better be careful how I look.
"
13,4,Cartman,"Clyde threw up on his way home! What makes you think you can put that kind of filth on television?! 
"
3,8,Stan,"You?! You think you had a bad night?! I had to hang out all night with these friggin' Melvins!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?
"
1,11,Cartman,"Oh, man, I wish I knew how to spell.
"
8,5,Cartman,"AWESOM-O will answers the door. 
"
3,2,Stan,"Station Eleven: Jesus is nailed to the cross. 
"
12,14,Butters,"All right!  If I don't make it back, tell my mom what happened to me. 
"
9,12,Stan,"Uh, thanks. So, first of all, I've written that the brainwashed alien ghosts are actually from a galaxy called Nubanon.
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"That was close, Mr. Hat.
"
11,3,Kyle,"Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
"
3,16,Kyle,"I know. It's probably gonna be the biggest night of our lives!
"
15,13,Kyle,"So, do you uh, do you have any brothers or sisters, Natalie?
"
12,2,Kyle,"How could we know she would... Aw we suck so hard.
"
14,10,Randy,"Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon.
"
5,7,Kyle,"Sure.
"
3,8,Randy,"O-hoh, yehah, I'm sure your wife would love that.
"
3,1,Cartman,"The nightmare begins.
"
18,1,Randy,"Uhhh, Stan? Aren't you supposed to be in school?
"
8,7,Stan,"Mom, Dad! Did you see? They found a man from the future!
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Stan, as your counselor, I'm here to help you with whatever problems you might have, m'kay? Now, what is the matter? 
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Thanks. Come, Slave.  Oh, it's just awful, Chef! I used to feel like an outsider, a totally different person who stood out in this town! Now every straight guy is acting gayer than me!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Lisa Berger is NOT HOT! She's fat and ugly! 
"
10,8,Stan,"Dad??
"
2,18,Stan,"You didn't find him, I found him.
"
12,7,Butters,"Jeez, uh cops are looking for us everywhere.
"
17,6,Cartman,"Kyle is doing all kinds of things for me. He finished my homework,  gave me the soda from his lunch.  I think he's just really stoked on me for helping bring peace to the Middle East.  Right, Kyle? 
"
2,10,Kyle,"Gods and clods?
"
14,5,Stan,"I have no idea...
"
5,6,Cartman,"He-hey, that's my money!
"
3,2,Stan,"I know, huh?
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"O-ogh! 
"
3,4,Kyle,"Get him!  Whoa, Tweek! Did you hear that?
"
11,10,Cartman,"Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! 
"
1,5,Stan,"She's just pissed off 'cause she got headgear at the dentist.  She's taking it out on me.
"
11,10,Kyle,"Dude! I had the same dream! We jumped on a dragon's back and, and Butters got left behind!
"
15,10,Stan,"Ugh, What's funny about having our private lives hacked into?!
"
1,11,Wendy,"Yes, she was!
"
8,11,Cartman,"That sounds perfect.
"
13,6,Randy,"What?! 
"
2,15,Cartman,"Dude, this is hella weird.
"
4,12,Stan,"Yeah. Third grade sucked! Cartman, why the hell did you try to make us think third grad was so great?!
"
9,8,Stan,"Boats don't have parking brakes, dumbass! They only have the... oh wait wait. Neutral button! 
"
1,8,Cartman,"Hey, hey, what's going on?!  Hey, let go of me! God-! Ey! I'll kick you in the nuts. D'you hear me?!
"
15,7,Cartman,"Looks like somebody's on the rag, huh Mom?
"
15,9,Butters,"So there I was, just yards away from the American border. All my amigos made it across, but I became lost in the woods. If the Whipples hadn't come along, I might have froze to death. But I'm not giving up, for I, am Mantequilla! 
"
1,13,Kyle,"Hi. We were wondering why fatass  I mean, Cartman, hasn't been showing up for school.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Well well well, here he comes. It's BJ McKay and his best friend Bear.
"
16,13,Stan,"You know what happens when you lie, Craig?! You hold that lie inside!
"
2,16,Kyle,"Aaww!
"
3,13,Butters,"Woo-oh Holy Cow! 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Poopin' outside,
Makin' self-serve ice cream
For my friends
Specially Kenny.
Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves?
"
3,15,Cartman,"...play stupid games.
"
9,1,Kyle,"Yep! I love basketball. I wanna play for the Denver Nuggets one day.
"
10,12,Cartman,"I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.
"
10,3,Kyle,"No!
"
15,5,Kyle,"What exactly can I do to help?
"
3,2,Randy,"Not now, Stan. I have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion. Or else.
"
15,12,Cartman,"I don't trust any of you assholes!  Where are you sons of bitches?! 
"
4,7,Stan,"Alright. Will you donate one of your kidneys to Kyle?
"
2,16,Kyle,"That's nice, Cartman.
"
6,6,Butters,"Uh Dad, can I uh can I see the newspaper real quick?
"
6,7,Kyle,"I'm so glad we're not murderers. 
"
13,9,Butters,"Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp.
"
12,3,Butters,"Whoa boy, he's cheesed out of his mind! 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Or if I did?
"
11,13,Butters,"They're gonna do it! 
"
16,2,Cartman,"Oh ahhhh, three bucks.
"
15,14,Cartman,"I was just teasing.
"
3,2,Stan,"And then Jesus' disciple, Peter, denies he knows him. 
"
12,7,Butters,"Oh gosh in heaven.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Guys, guys! We have total respect for you! When we name our company ""Washington Redskins,"" it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people. 
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Aw.)
"
17,10,Wendy,"Are you just an asshole?! Is that it?!
"
7,6,Butters,"Who-o-o-o-a. Oowwww!
"
4,15,Kyle,"Whoa! 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Say, Mr. Slave.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Hey, who are you?
"
9,8,Stan,"I kept it secret, for two days!
"
1,11,Wendy,"No, it's okay, Stan!  Everything's going to be o-kay!
"
4,1,Stan,"Ooh, my God, we killed Kenny.
"
1,13,Cartman,"Really? You don't think so?
"
1,13,Mr. Garrison,"No!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats.  My name is Mr. Garrison, and I'm the new kindergarten teacher. I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little  ""nervous breakdown"" and went into the mountains where I lived off of ""rat carcasses"".  But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten.  But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it?  No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with roll call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?
"
9,5,Stan,"I don't suppose you guys want to win this game.
"
11,13,Stan,"And there's no score? No crowds?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Uh-OH, thanks, Mr. Tweek.
"
1,6,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole.
"
8,10,Stan,"Yeah, who cares?
"
3,3,Cartman,"That's what I told him, but he doesn't listen to reason.
"
1,7,Kyle,"Dude, dressing up like Hitler is not badass!
"
15,2,Cartman,"Well, I tried.
"
11,14,Butters,"You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me.
"
12,1,Kyle,"Knock it off! Right now! This isn't funny! At all!
"
4,9,Randy,"Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Hold on a second! 
"
5,13,Stan,"Hey, I wasn't Kenny's worst f-f-f-friend!  Cartman was! 
"
16,11,Butters,"But what does being Hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period?
"
7,3,Butters,"Yeah. And boy, are they gonna uh let me have it! Just wait till my father gets here!
"
11,5,Stan,"No! No! 
"
6,16,Butters,"Hah-hey, I wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents, too.
"
2,7,Cartman,"All done!
"
13,14,Kyle,"Most likely.
"
1,8,Cartman,"B-huh, huh. Yeah, right.
"
4,9,Stan,"Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home. 
"
12,7,Kyle,"I don't believe it.
"
1,10,Cartman,"Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! 
"
15,9,Stan,"Yeah, I think he was. Wait.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Candy bars?
"
2,9,Stan,"There is what again? 
"
1,4,Stan,"I will Big Gay Al, I will. 
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"I couldn't help but notice that black eye you have.  Are there problems at home?
"
3,5,Kyle,"What do you have to think about?
"
9,12,Stan,"Well-h. I mean, you're not... you're not like as good as Leonardo DiCaprio, but you're okay, I guess.
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, I tell you boys, women can kill. Poontang's expensive. That's why when it comes to chicks, I just screw them and leave them. I'd say ""get out of my bedroom, poontang, before you suck my life dry!""
"
13,10,Kenny,"(I can keep the baby...)
"
6,13,Cartman,"We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Hyeah, that poor, poor thing
"
5,3,Stan,"That trick sucks, Jesus.
"
3,5,Kyle,"It just ran by here a second ago. 
"
15,12,Cartman,"This window locks from the inside, right? And this door has a lock on it too? Don't worry Polly Prissypants, you're gonna be safe here. In this day and age, black people are just impervious to being fucked with, so we will be alright.
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Billy. Billy Thompson?
"
8,4,Stan,"We just asked him to join our dance troupe. We heard he was state tap champion.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Jennifer Lopez
"
13,9,Wendy,"Leave me alone.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Okay, everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu.
"
6,10,Cartman,"God, you know what, that's so true? Because, you sometimes never really think about how old a pet is until it's gone.
"
10,13,Kyle,"What do you want?!
"
18,9,Cartman,"Heh that's right, Butters will back me up on anything. He's such a bitch.
"
4,6,Stan,"We're making faces at sick people.
"
3,1,Stan,"Holy crap! 
"
6,7,Stan,"So what should we do? 
"
2,14,Kyle,"I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman.
"
15,8,Stan,"Ugh God.
"
9,14,Randy,"Uh, you you shouldn't drink, because it leads to uh bad things. I was in jail for the night and well I guess I donno, I... Just don't drink but,... if you must drink, d-definitely don't drive. I've... definitely learned that firsthand, and uh, uuh, that's all, I guess.
"
8,4,Stan,"Dammit, where are we gonna get our fifth member?
"
4,12,Cartman,"Hey, what the hell is with these little half-desks?
"
9,11,Cartman,"Red Power!
"
13,12,Stan,"We did it! Yeah!
"
2,12,Stan,"You really think so?
"
2,7,Stan,"Do you see 'er dude?
"
1,7,Kyle,"You still didn't get a costume Kenny? 
"
14,9,Kyle,"Hey, dudes.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, Craig, how about you?
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Who tries to control the marriage? And by that I mean, who's dominating the aspects of the relationship?
"
6,4,Cartman,"Hello.
"
4,12,Cartman,"Yes! We've had a new time machine built: this one out of a simple microwave oven and a duck  Au revoir, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in the past, hahaa. Gentlemen? 
"
1,10,Stan,"But you're his sparring partner, Chef.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Stop. It.
"
13,14,Cartman,"Day one. It has happened. The Mayans were right. The only thing they got wrong was the date. It is 2009, and I appear to be the last of my species alive. Now it's just me, all alone, with minorities. What will the minorities do with me? I'm sure that's what on all of their minds. I have to make myself seem useful to them or they will surely not let me live.  Does anyone need medical help? I am a doctor. 
"
7,8,Cartman,"What a dork!
"
9,6,Kyle,"Yes, but he thrives on that.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?
"
14,10,Wendy,"Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Uuf, I feel weak. How do I look?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Marijuwana's bad.
"
8,4,Stan,"Hey kid, you're pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?
"
16,14,Cartman,"Run now, little firefly. It's all part of the plan.
"
6,13,Stan,"Wait. A drop box.  Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!
"
8,6,Cartman,"Oh my God, this is awesome! 
"
8,8,Randy,"This is breaking your mother's heart, Stan. She couldn't even help tie you to the horse.
"
2,9,Wendy,"Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?
"
4,7,Stan,"Well, it's my friend, Kyle. I think he's really, really sick.
"
2,6,Stan,"We shot all those videos and sent them in.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
4,7,Kenny,"(No, no.)
"
6,14,Kyle,"Uhh, not cool.
"
4,12,Butters,"Well, buh wuh when we pull our pants down,  should we stand frontways or back? I mean, do we show 'er our... behinds, or-ar our w-wieners?
"
11,3,Cartman,"It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! 
"
9,4,Cartman,"YES YES, I KNOW! UP YOURS, KYLE!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Come on!
"
10,3,Kyle,"Ahhh!
"
8,2,Cartman,"What? What'd I do?
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Hey!
"
18,10,Kyle,"No, it's great! It's just what this country needs right now!
"
11,10,Butters,"Hey guys!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Tim-mih.
"
3,8,Butters,"Well, hooray!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Jesus, this is a long drive. Are we in Hawaii yet?
"
10,4,Kyle,"I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more.
"
18,1,Stan,"Yeah, I know that. But a good company should never have seven words in its title.
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Oh, that's quick thinking, Artemus Clyde Frog.  Listen very carefully, Mr. Kitty. I am putting this picture of the babysitter and her boyfriend on your collar.  You have to take this picture to Mommy, Kitty, so that she can come home and save me.  Now run, Kitty. Take this picture to Mommy, and lead her back here. When you return, be sure to bring Mom in through the back door. Hurry, Kitty! You're my only hope!  That's it! That's it, Mr. Kitty! 
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh. Hi, I'm Randy Marsh.
"
1,4,Cartman,"We'll just see about that.
"
13,6,Randy,"No heywaitwait, no!  Well that sucks!
"
10,8,Kyle,"Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?
"
12,7,Wendy,"Hey look. 
"
17,8,Butters,"Listen, buddy! You promised that pizzas were on the way! If they don't show up right now, you're gonna have a dead kid in your hands! Do you hear me?!
"
16,2,Cartman,"This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. 
"
14,9,Randy,"Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?
"
15,7,Kyle,"Look dude, it's just one movie. We wanna have a good time.
"
10,8,Stan,"I know you do, Dad.
"
3,11,Cartman,"It's Sally Struthers!
"
4,17,Butters,"Well, alright. Here's a little paper construction of Santa Claus.  ""Ho ho ho, uh, there-a kid. Hu-uh, would you like some- t-hoys and stuff"" Hah, and uh, here's a little Jesus.  ""Hi there, Santa. I am the Light and the Way, and stuff.""  ""Uh, ho o-kay. That's good, I suppose."" Huh, and here's the cutout versions of you guys. 
"
8,7,Kyle,"If you want your share of the money, then you're gonna shovel snow like the rest of us!
"
7,1,Stan,"No! 
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!
"
13,5,Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?
"
3,13,Kyle,"You will?
"
4,14,Kyle,"Look, I know it isn't exactly what we wanted, but maybe we can train it.
"
18,6,Stan,"We're playing board games, so that Grandpa avoids the casino and I avoid freemium apps.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool.
"
14,1,Cartman,"Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??
"
14,9,Cartman,"No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!
"
1,13,Cartman,"Oh. I don't know, Clyde Frog. I just am.
"
2,12,Stan,"No, you don't!
"
4,6,Cartman,"I've outgrown all my friends. I need to meet more mature people, Clyde Frog.  Oh, great idea, Clyde Frog!  I can meet new friends on the Internet!  Here's a chat room: ""Men Who Like Young Boys""  That's perfect.  Hi everybody! I am a young boy seeking an older male for good times. I am eight years old and would li-  Wow! Look at all these guys who wanna be my friend! I'll pick... Tony316.  Hi Tony.  ""So what are you into?""  Oh, you know, the usual stuff. Smiley-face.  ""Kewl. Wanna get together?  Smiley-face?""  Sure, Tony! That would be... kewl. Winking, smiley, face.  ""Meet me at Mel's Buffet restaurant tomorrow morning.""  Sounds good. See you then! Clown hat, curly hair, smiley-face.  You see that, Clyde Frog? Tomorrow I'm gonna meet my first mature friend!
"
1,3,Stan,"I don't want to shoot the bunny.
"
12,13,Cartman,"...Freakin' hybrids, man. They just don't do the trick anymore. 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! 
"
6,1,Butters,"W-well, k-kinda like Cartman.  Aw!
"
2,12,Randy,"Uh oh! 
"
9,4,Stan,"You mean, Cartman's side is right?
"
7,3,Kyle,"That's not fair!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Oh my God. You-you're right, Timmy. You're totally right.  Everyone, can I have your attention, please?  I'm afraid I have to give back my medal. The truth is, I haven't been playing fair either. I've been using st-steroids. I was willing to do anything to be the best, and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting.  A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn't listen to him.  Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics.  Because you're taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you're really not a winner. You're just a p-pussy. You're just a  big fat p-p-pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say,  ""Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy- ""  ""-steroid-taking jackass.""  That's how I feel about myself, and why I must decline this medal and my place in the history books. And if you'll let me, I'll be back next year. To compete with honor.  '
"
16,14,Cartman,"Yes. Tell me again exactly what you plan on doing with it?
"
13,11,Stan,"So? Dude, don't you guys care? We have to do something?
"
17,7,Randy,"I'm just trying to earn some extra holiday cash.
"
8,10,Kyle,"Dude, when he gets out he's gonna be really mad!
"
14,8,Butters,"Hey Eric.
"
8,6,Cartman,"Oh man, that was great! You guys know what Mr. Jefferson said? He said I'm his best friend, and I can go over to his house whenever I want! I'm supposed to go right back over there after dinner tonight!
"
4,10,Kyle,"I'm gonna go ask my mom! 
"
9,2,Cartman,"Please, I have to talk to you all right now!
"
6,16,Butters,"Huh? Naw, I'm Professor Chaos, Stan.
"
3,3,Cartman,"You guys, it's six in the morning, I have to get some sleep.
"
3,2,Randy,"It's in the attic with the old LP's.  Boys, did you notice anything uuuh strange about Kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion? Ooh, what did he spend his time doing?
"
10,9,Mr. Mackey,"Now you might all think I've given up finding out who crapped in the urinal. M'kay? And maybe, maybe you think it's a victimless crime. This, is Mr. Venezuela , the school janitor. Okay?  He's the person... who has to clean up... when some trickster... drops a dook in the wrong toilet! Mr. Venezuela makes six bucks an hour at best! Okay? He's got three kids at home, he's got a car that barely works, he's gotta clean up puke with sawdust, m'kay, then he walks into the boys' room and sees a big meaty chud starin' him in the face!  So when you crapped in that urinal, m'kay, you might as well have just dropped your pants, and laid a turd right on top of Mr. Venezuela's head!  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?!
"
6,16,Butters,"Oh... Oohhhh.  But that's like they're lyin'
"
5,3,Cartman,"Heheh, guess who I am, guys?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well thanks. You too.  So uh, Randy, you want me to give you a hand job in the bathroom?
"
12,9,Butters,"All right! 
"
14,6,Cartman,"I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
"
8,11,Cartman,"Nice, Butters, write that down!
"
1,9,Mr. Mackey,"Well-uh, a fecophiliac is somebody who's obsessed with mookie-stinks, Kyle.
"
9,8,Stan,"No.
"
3,1,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
18,2,Cartman,"KYYYLE!
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Shutting me down? Why?
"
1,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh.
"
15,8,Stan,"Maybe it won't be like before, but... at least it'll all be new. And that's what's gonna make it so that I can keep going. For the first time in a long time, I'm really excited. 
"
5,8,Cartman,"Oh yeah, Thirst for Blood. Bring it.
"
14,3,Randy,"And when it gets cold it shrinks. 
"
13,3,Stan,"What's all gone?
"
2,16,Stan,"Not yet. I think we still have a ways to go.
"
7,13,Cartman,"No... No, Mr. Mackey... We don't have any cigarettes.
"
18,2,Stan,"So hey, I was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid Maze Runner movie.
"
10,14,Stan,"Ohhh.
"
4,15,Kenny,"(WHAT?!)
"
9,9,Butters,"Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me.
"
1,6,Mr. Garrison,"That's right Mr. Hat, shows like Terrance & Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor.' They don't expand your minds.  You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash.  Kenny, why are you late to class?  Oh, okay Kenny, be seated.  Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because...  Yes Kenny, what is it?
"
12,3,Kyle,"Pot's illegal too, but people still manage to find it. Ever since that first time Kenny cheesed, he hasn't been the same. You've all noticed the change in him. I'll bet Kenny's at home cheesing right now.
"
1,10,Kyle,"Hey, Jesus! Ih-if you win the fight, can you turn Kenny back to normal?
"
18,7,Butters,"Huh I'm sorry Dad!
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"And Wendy, I'm still not believing the labor pains.
"
5,8,Stan,"Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! 
"
5,9,Cartman,"Awww, come onnn! How am I gonna kill people with those?
"
6,4,Stan,"Three of us can sleep while one keeps watch. We'll shift every couple of hours.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Oh. Hm. Uh, I guess that's a little different.
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Why can't you behave?
"
15,12,Cartman,"I know that I'm awesome and keewl, Polly Prissypants, but it has little relevance at the moment to Clyde Frog's murder!
"
5,7,Wendy,"Are you wearing a condom?
"
13,1,Stan,"You guys, I think this is serious. There's something really wrong with him.
"
17,8,Butters,"Yeah, I finished it!
"
2,16,Kyle,"What's all that stuff?
"
10,7,Cartman,"Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. 
"
8,1,Mr. Garrison,"You see the damage you've caused, Eric Cartman?! What were you thinking?!
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmmih!  Tih... ti-timmih.
"
8,8,Kenny,"(Giant douche.)
"
14,8,Stan,"Dude, noo, you- you don't know that.
"
8,7,Cartman,"We can't understand you, asshole! 
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Oh wow, this is so exciting, isn't it?  And the winner is...  Oh my God! Jimmy Valmer! I can't believe I w- won! 
"
6,7,Kyle,"Yep. But I guess this proves that war is the natural order of life.
"
4,13,Cartman,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle.
"
8,1,Butters,"Huh nice attempt, ninja! But now both of you shall feel the power of my Web of Holding!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You are both trapped in spiderwebs! 
"
17,6,Kyle,"I am happy, Stan. I'm thrilled.
"
12,2,Stan,"And she's at a hotel in our town. 
"
8,3,Stan,"Oh God, here we go again.
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"Well, that's it! All of you have detention for the rest of the week!
"
6,3,Stan,"Hey Butters, those other freak people from the show were just over here looking for you?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Those pants and those shoes say you pound butt!!
"
15,6,Butters,"Um, excuse me?
"
13,2,Kyle,"Who? Me? Why?
"
5,1,Cartman,"It was just on the news! People are freaking out, dude.
"
7,9,Randy,"Stan, are you okay?
"
16,4,Butters,"Hoh da lolly! This is gonna be so much fun!
"
7,15,Kyle,"We don't have time for this.
"
6,14,Cartman,"Nothing.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Don't do it, kid. 
"
3,14,Cartman,"Yes we are!
"
17,3,Cartman,"He's pissed off. Because of something that happened a long time ago but he won't forget.
"
1,9,Kyle,"O-Okay.  But don't scare him...
"
1,12,Kyle,"Yeah. How'd you know?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Yeah. Man, that sucks about Butters.  Well, let's get going, shall we?
"
13,14,Butters,"You said you could hold your breath the longest, Kyle.
"
4,14,Stan,"No, that cannot be. Honey you are scaring me.
"
3,10,Stan,"Dude, did you just say ""a-ight""?
"
17,5,Kyle,"Let's just give it a chance, Ike.
"
17,3,Cartman,"This grudge that you're holding against an entire group of people should be directed at just a few, not at me.
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all.  Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
"
6,10,Cartman,"Well dumbasses, how are we gonna make room for Bebe!?
"
6,4,Stan,"We're gonna go to save the little baby cows, fatass!
"
3,3,Cartman,"My asshole eye doctor made them all dilevated.
"
4,17,Butters,"Huh, well, okay. Now, don't expect too much with the budget you gave me.
"
4,16,Stan,"You guys, stop it!  Sorry about them. Kindergartners are kind of spazzes.
"
2,14,Cartman,"We have Chocolate Nuggies and S'more Crunchies…
"
14,3,Randy,"Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. 
"
9,3,Stan,"You were awesome, Token!
"
7,11,Kyle,"Where is Butters? We were supposed to leave here forty minutes ago.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Yeah, I bet she does.
"
14,4,Stan,"What?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, I uh I'm very happy to get this award. Uh but you know what makes me even happier? Sucking balls.
"
16,7,Kyle,"God-damnit! 
"
6,8,Kyle,"Calm down, Tweek. There has to be a rational explanation.
"
12,1,Kyle,"Wagh.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Oh! Hey, Kenny.
"
8,5,Butters,"Now I'm gonna have to give ya a spankin', AWESOM-O, so that you'll learn better!  Just know, AWESOM-O, that I did it because I love you. Okay, come on, let's go make some breakfast.
"
15,9,Stan,"So, so then, so then the pope says, ""Maybe you should go check the toilet."" 
"
10,9,Kyle,"Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Got something to say Kyle?! 
"
6,15,Cartman,"Twelve hours?? Jesus Christ!
"
3,3,Cartman,"Ow! I hate you!
"
7,1,Kyle,"What the? Where are, where are we?
"
16,4,Cartman,"HUH?!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!
"
3,10,Randy,"Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Oh Jesus, what now?! 
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Well children, I'd love to, but the doctor say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy.
"
7,5,Kyle,"No you didn't, asshole! What you did was totally stupid and racist! And you only did it to screw me over!
"
10,7,Cartman,"Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now.
"
4,6,Stan,"You don't pay tax dollars, Cartman! You're eight!
"
15,5,Cartman,"It's not just a hot tub. Taste it. Go ahead, taste it. 
"
5,8,Stan,"They've taken it. They've taken our Okama GameSphere.
"
8,4,Randy,"Now! 
"
10,13,Cartman,"Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?
"
16,5,Butters,"OH.  Uh, it's okay. Um I'm not hungry anyways.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Yeah. Jesus, I never thought I'd have anything in common with you, Cartman.
"
13,13,Cartman,"You don't know how many Smurfberries the life of each Smurf is worth.
"
1,2,Stan,"Mr. Garrison, stop!
"
1,9,Kyle,"Come on, Mary!  Push!
"
8,11,Butters,"Boy, that was a great episode!
"
17,10,Butters,"Oh, she said it again!
"
13,9,Cartman,"Atta boy Butters!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Did it work?
"
5,3,Cartman,"No you're not.
"
3,8,Randy,"Come on, Stan, you're gonna have a great time.
"
4,8,Cartman,"No way!
"
2,8,Stan,"What does he mean, ""living in denial""?
"
16,12,Randy,"According to industry experts, many rural areas don't have the bandwidth to support DVD-quality video in streaming services, and won't for years to come, making DVD rentals still the best movie-watching option. 
"
10,8,Cartman,"Everyone target scorpions.
"
13,13,Stan,"What the hell do you think you're doing?!
"
5,11,Stan,"Yeah, haha.
"
12,7,Kyle,"Sister, you don't know the half of it.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Stan...  Do you really think my hat is stupid?
"
3,12,Kyle,"She's not here!
"
8,8,Cartman,"Goddammit, you guys, Butters is our friend! And he's allowed to have his opinion! Butters, which is funnier? A stupid not-funny giant douche or a super funny turd sandwich?
"
10,2,Butters,"I'm here, Eric.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Yeah. I've gone through every student in the school, and I'm pretty sure now that Kenny's gone, the poor kid is Craig!
"
17,2,Stan,"Aha! 
"
18,8,Cartman,"You hear that, McNuggets? You're goin' to the big leagues!
"
7,11,Butters,"AAAAHH!
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
"
8,5,Butters,"Come on, AWESOM-O! We're gonna go a- sightseein'!
"
7,5,Cartman,"What do they want?
"
7,7,Randy,"The spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you, son. Seek out the wise man in Bellocreek. Now go. GO! 
"
6,6,Cartman,"Yes, well, we weren't.
"
10,12,Cartman,"No. There is something I can do.
"
6,1,Butters,"Uh, I don't know about this, fellas.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Now we just gotta wait for his urection, and I can give it to my dad.
"
11,14,Wendy,"Go ahead.
"
8,14,Cartman,"That's not at all what happens.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Very well. Yea. Guys, let us walk to mine home and see what mine mom wants. 
"
4,13,Stan,"Cartman, you have to stop!
"
16,12,Cartman,"Oh my God. You mean they don't know people can stream movies cheaper and more conveniently online?
"
1,10,Cartman,"That's it! Party is over!  Everybody go home!  GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT! 
"
2,8,Kyle,"Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
"
11,5,Stan,"I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
"
13,12,Stan,"Ohh, it all makes sense now. 
"
4,15,Stan,"I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
"
2,18,Stan,"We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming.  I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all!  Yes, Clyde!
"
1,10,Kyle,"Aaaaa!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Well ah, loosen up, you bloody vaginal belch.
"
3,5,Mr. Mackey,"Jakovasaurs kinda piss me off, mkay.
"
14,3,Randy,"I gotta get to the doctor! 
"
12,12,Stan,"Why does that matter?
"
6,5,Stan,"Dude, why is this guy always beating everybody up?
"
3,10,Kyle,"What?
"
10,8,Cartman,"All right, everyone ready?
"
7,15,Stan,"Dude, we just can't up and go to Canada. Look, they're about to light the Christmas tree. Maybe you can get your brother back some other way. 
"
18,9,Stan,"We're not being grandpas! Your guys's stuff is just seriously lame! Our generation's stuff is cool!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Wait a minute! You guys did make me ride that bull!
"
13,10,Cartman,"I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!
"
13,6,Randy,"Or, or whatever they did, I'm sayin'.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Mom, this guy doesn't-
"
12,2,Cartman,"All right lady, just flash us your crotch or somethin'.
"
7,3,Stan,"Is this the right house?
"
17,3,Cartman,"No Token! Stop beating my daughter! NOOO! 
"
16,1,Stan,"Throw it here! Throw it here!  Yeah! Nice one, Clyde! 
"
13,8,Cartman,"Was I alarmed?  Yes.  I believe I was.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Oh Jesus Christ, I had to see it to believe it! What the hell are you doing?!
"
6,15,Kyle,"We have a dead friend.
"
18,7,Kyle,"NO! I put your headset on, and came here to-
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey, wait a minute. You know, you guys should know one thing.  Most people in America are good people. We just try to live day by day, like you guys do. Maybe if you took some time to see all the great things about our country, you'd see... we're not so different after all.
"
10,2,Stan,"No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!
"
5,4,Cartman,"'""I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.""' 
"
1,8,Mr. Garrison,"Children, children! To honor this special time of year we'll be doing a canned food drive. Does anybody know what a canned food drive is?  Yes, Eric?
"
17,2,Randy,"Punched his trees, huh?
"
14,8,Cartman,"You see that? Dayanica Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Woohoo!) 
"
12,1,Kyle,"No! No God damn it no! I'm telling you you're wrong! There, there's no way I can have HIV! Unless maybe...  Oh my God. That son of a bitch! 
"
4,11,Cartman,"Praise God! How do you feel now? Do you feel the light of God inside o'ya?
"
7,3,Cartman,"But can I still kill Kyyyle?
"
13,3,Stan,"Do I really have to do this, Dad?
"
2,17,Cartman,"How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Yeahhh, you already know about it?
"
6,15,Kyle,"Yee-yeah.
"
3,17,Stan,"Who's Karen Carpenter?
"
9,7,Mr. Mackey,"Huh?  Oh oh oh, right.
"
9,1,Kyle,"I'm a hundred percent ready, coach! 
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uhkay?
"
7,4,Stan,"Well, first we lost one study partner when Cartman put himself in the hospital, and then they took Kenny away, and then Kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for Dalight Saving, so we couldn't find anything in the history books about Iraq and then-
"
12,6,Randy,"How do you know?!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Yeah, that's me.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Screw Halloween, I already got my Christmas present! In a few days I'll wrap it back up, and then when I open it on Christmas, I'll act all, like, surprised, like ""Oh Mother, Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll! What a surprise!"" 
"
1,3,Kyle,"Shut up, Cartman! You can't scare anybody!
"
3,2,Randy,"Well, they're right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.
"
14,9,Randy,"Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!
"
11,1,Randy,"I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. 
"
1,6,Stan,"Dad, Death is coming!
"
12,3,Kyle,"Whoa! 
"
7,14,Butters,"Hi, Mercedes. It's me, Lexus's boyfriend. I brought my parents over to meet her.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Just, the grapevine. Um, there's something you should probably know.  Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know, ...together?
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"I don't know what to believe in anymore, okay?! 
"
2,13,Stan,"Oh, he's fine, dude.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Not if you... have some delicious farts for me.
"
15,5,Kyle,"So then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an Internet ad to Payless Shoe Source go?
"
4,10,Cartman,"What? No! It shouldn't be locked! We have to confess! We have to confess our sins before we die!
"
2,10,Randy,"Stan?
"
10,8,Cartman,"Yeah, come on, let's go!  I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!
"
2,8,Stan,"There's nothin' to do.
"
1,13,Cartman,"What?!  Son of a bitch!
"
15,8,Stan,"Dude, just tell me the secret to Cartman Burger
"
8,6,Kyle,"Hey. Do you live here?
"
6,5,Stan,"Oh, dude, let's go!
"
6,6,Stan,"So today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends.  It was a really fun time. We rode all the rides and everyone got along great.
"
10,3,Kyle,"I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Oh he-hey, N-Nathan.
"
3,17,Kenny,"(Uh-uh.)
"
3,10,Stan,"Yeah, dude. That was totally gay.
"
6,13,Jimmy,"That video could have been made by Sauron's evil f-...forces.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Here, check 'em out.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Okay, Stan, I'm gonna you... a UFO crash-landing card!  You can deny it, or cover it up.
"
1,13,Stan,"Cartman?!
"
1,2,Cartman,"No they don't, you jealous weakling!
"
8,10,Stan,"This is hopeless!
"
5,9,Stan,"Dude, these people are insane.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, kids. Uh, we have some news. Uh, there's been a terrible flood in Oklahoma, m'kay? So the 4-million-recorder-children's event is being moved to Arkansas.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"...Well, this is gonna be a tough one, kids.
"
6,12,Stan,"Well, so much for our winning ticket. Cartman probably drank that with the rest of Kenny! 
"
16,14,Cartman,"Haha. 
"
11,14,Kyle,"The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
"
2,10,Stan,"Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
"
2,12,Stan,"I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
"
5,5,Stan,"Dude, you didn't tell him Terrance would be there.
"
2,6,Kyle,"Dude, they're gonna look so stupid.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Oho, really? What are you gonna do about it, Wendy?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Go to MySpace.  See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.
"
8,5,Stan,"Uh yeah, Butters, he's real cool.
"
8,9,Randy,"Yeah. This place has a power over us we can't resist! We have to find a way to put the South Park Wall-Mart out of business once and for all!
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Sorry I'm late.
"
10,4,Kyle,"Yes! 
"
3,2,Stan,"Wow, my dad's the best! All other dads suck compared to my dad!
"
16,8,Cartman,"I don't now what to do. Kids are starting to make fun of me because, I'm no good at sarcastaball. I suck at being nice and polite. I'm so good at sucking I should work at a Thai massage parlor.
"
7,5,Cartman,"What news?
"
5,10,Mr. Mackey,"Well, I can't think of anything that would be THAT funny.
"
7,6,Butters,"Yeah. I was up there poundin' my wiener for two days straight, aaand finally, I thought about Stan's Mom's boobs, and this little tiny spooge of... this white stuff came out.
"
6,12,Cartman,"I said ""Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!""  Did I just call myself a blood-belching vagina?
"
6,3,Butters,"Uh, but that's me. I'm Butters.
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"You can't know.
"
5,5,Kenny,"(AAAAHH!)
"
12,13,Cartman,"Hahahahaha, look at Kenny's lunch, a baloney sandwich and water! Hahaha, Goddamn your family's poor, dude. 
"
1,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love y-
"
5,14,Butters,"You mean, spy on him? Uh but... ain't that kind of like... fibbin'?
"
15,10,Stan,"Hi. Does a Vernon Trumski live here?
"
11,11,Cartman,"NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Dad, I'm really feeling sad and let down right now, and I feel like I can't even get a response from you. Could I at the very least please just get a what what-what?
"
1,13,Cartman,"Ohh. Nothing. It's just... nothing.
"
10,11,Kyle,"...Smalls. 
"
10,7,Cartman,"Mom, I want a Twinkie.
"
9,13,Cartman,"Yeah, I feel pretty awesome right now. 
"
14,5,Cartman,"Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
"
6,9,Stan,"When did we do dibs for it?
"
7,1,Stan,"Okay okay, take the form of something else!
"
2,17,Stan,"That's okay with us.
"
10,6,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, students, we have a very special guest speaker today. Who can tell me the name of our country's last vice-president?
"
5,2,Cartman,"Hey, yeah!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Yeah, I feel great. Why?  You think something's wrong? 
"
14,3,Randy,"All right!
"
1,9,Kyle,"Damnit!
"
7,6,Stan,"Put that away, dude! 
"
3,4,Cartman,"Come on, Craig!
"
7,1,Stan,"What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?
"
2,5,Stan,"Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!  Places! 
"
17,7,Cartman,"I'm not sure if his heart is in the right place. If he were to ever...  switch sides,  it could make Stan's army problematic for us.
"
15,11,Randy,"AAAA!
"
16,4,Butters,"It's all quiet out front, Eric.
"
18,1,Kyle,"Give it time, it'll grow on you.
"
6,2,Kyle,"Look, Stan. When Kenny died I learned how important friends are. I'm not gonna lose another friend.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
12,9,Cartman,"The thing is, Wendy, I really think you're awesome, and I know I'm just a nerdy little weakling to you, but I want to be your friend because I don't have that many friends at schooooooooooool. 
"
15,9,Butters,"...What did he say? Ah I actually don't speak Spanish.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Do you what this means?
"
1,13,Stan,"I donnow, just keep rolling.
"
6,13,Butters,"Precious! 
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"Hold Butters' hand, Eric! 
"
15,13,Cartman,"Okay, let's take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? 
"
3,9,Kyle,"Don't worry, Ike. Squirts is fun. And I'll be right over there in the next building. 
"
12,6,Stan,"What about Starbucks? They have free Internet.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Well, we tried, dude. If anyone else in this craphole hates Americans, we'd better just leave the goat and get back to the plane!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
15,4,Cartman,"I AM SO SICK OF THIS FUCKING SCHOOOOOL!  This stupid school and its stupid principal have gone to far this time!!
"
5,2,Kenny,"(Yeah, see ya.)
"
2,13,Stan,"My ass we will!
"
5,12,Stan,"Dude, just because we rip on you for being rich doesn't mean we don't like you.
"
1,10,Kyle,"Yeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.
"
18,7,Butters,"Ahhh, huh?
"
18,7,Butters,"Oh Jesus! 
"
13,10,Butters,"No way!
"
8,8,Mr. Mackey,"Stan's vote bring the total votes for Turd Sandwich to... thirty six! And Giant Douche has... one thousand, four hundred, and ten. Giant Douche still wins!
"
1,13,Cartman,"No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!
"
7,10,Stan,"Ah, I think there's a police car behind you, Grandpa.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Hey Timmy. How many able-bodied people does it take to screw in a light bulb? One.  You know what you call an able-bodied guy on the doorstep? Whatever his name is. 
"
8,1,Butters,"Hello? Anybody-eh.  Woof. Woof. Woofwoof.  Eh. Woof, eh. Woof. 
"
17,2,Randy,"What?! We'll see about this!  Excuse me, our content is being blocked and we need it now!
"
1,1,Cartman,"No, that was just a dream.
"
1,7,Cartman,"Eh, too bad drinking scotch isn't a paying job, or else Kenny's dad would be a millionaire.  I said your dad would be a millionaire, get it?! Kenny?! Your family is poor Kenny!! Your family's poor!!!  I don't like Kenny anymore, he, he just doesn't communicate.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Got it. 
"
8,6,Cartman,"He is my friend, got it?! I was friends with him before you assholes were,  and I hoowi-  Stan! Stan, I'm seriously! You'd better not be talking bad about me in there to Mr. Jefferson!
"
13,1,Stan,"We... don't work for any-body.
"
13,6,Randy,"Alright, fine, look: there's plenty of space cash to go around!  Thanks to us, our planet is rich, son! 
"
1,7,Stan,"Oh my God! They killed Kenny!
"
13,10,Kyle,"If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Well, I've gotta go start our animation. We've only got two days. 
"
6,7,Butters,"Nnno , uh no, no, it can't be.
"
1,8,Stan,"Hello? Is this Sally Struthers?  Oh.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Booooooo!
"
3,16,Cartman,"Quiet, Kenny. The goddess lives in all of us and has-
"
3,3,Cartman,"I'm just here for an eye exam, all right?! Keep the fat jokes to yourself!
"
5,7,Kyle,"Well that does it! If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!
"
10,7,Cartman,"Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!
"
10,3,Kyle,"I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Wuughhhuh. Where do I go? What do I do?
"
14,3,Randy,"Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going ""whaaa?"" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Damnit, Kenny! Can't this thing go any faster?!
"
15,5,Cartman,"Yeah it's a good idea! Now go get us Slash for halftime!  Jesus Christ!  Are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company, Kyle? Goddamn!
"
16,14,Cartman,"Trust me: they're somewhere nobody will ever find them! If you kill me, then Obama will stay President and you will lose Star Wars to the Chinese forever!
"
7,14,Kyle,"Aw, dude, come on. I gotta do my science homework.
"
12,11,Stan,"All right, let's go. 
"
8,10,Cartman,"Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. 
"
11,7,Randy,"Face it, we're gonna starve!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih!  Aaar-yaaaaah Timmih! 
"
2,16,Cartman,"We don't care, Mom.
"
6,9,Kyle,"What?
"
6,8,Cartman,"That's stupid and immature, Cartman!
"
13,3,Randy,"We've done everything we can and yet the Economy has not improved. Worse, it has declined! Poor Bart here just lost his job at Little Caesar's Pizza. Our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one Jew. Why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the Economy?
"
10,9,Stan,"What who said?
"
6,15,Stan,"Jesus Christ.
"
1,13,Cartman,"His tongue? Chef?? Chef is my dad??
"
6,16,Kyle,"Throw it away, Clyde!
"
8,1,Kenny,"(I just threw my ninja star at him.)
"
11,10,Cartman,"Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Why did YOU measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board?!
"
1,9,Kyle,"Yeah... You know, it seems like something's still not right. 
"
11,1,Randy,"Uh well, like anybody else thought it was ""naggers"". I mean, right?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Not yet.
"
4,9,Randy,"...and they took back my house.
"
4,14,Butters,"...Wow, did you see that? They had a horse, too!
"
7,7,Mr. Mackey,"It's over, Stanley. What else can we do?
"
17,9,Cartman,"They're not a part of your betrayal?
"
11,13,Kyle,"It was pretty fun, wasn't it?
"
10,14,Stan,"Sso then we win?
"
6,12,Randy,"A ladder to heaven? Why, son?
"
12,13,Kenny,"(I swear too.)
"
3,12,Cartman,"Mom, mom! You wanna see what I want for Christmas?
"
1,2,Wendy,"My paper was on the suffering of bottlenose dolphins.
"
8,6,Cartman,"Remember, Mr. Jefferson? You said we were best friends. 
"
10,8,Cartman,"What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
"
11,9,Randy,"You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!
"
16,3,Kyle,"Yeah, yeah, that's cool. Bring the left titty out some more.  Yeah, yeah freeze there. 
"
2,13,Stan,"What ride?
"
2,16,Cartman,"Uncle Stinky, my stupid friends want to see Mr. Hankey! You have to take us!
"
2,18,Stan,"I found him, I'm rescuing him! 
"
11,5,Stan,"Does Mom know about this?
"
15,10,Stan,"You see? There, look! It says Eavesdropper's biggest story every is coming out this afternoon.
"
8,8,Stan,"The whole thing is a joke!
"
14,8,Butters,"Eric?
"
11,1,Stan,"Well, yeah.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Butters, you have to tell us what Cartman is up to!
"
7,15,Cartman,"Fine. But if it doesn't work, you and me are gonna have it out, Kyle. Once and for all.
"
9,8,Stan,"Dude, ah I just...  ah I don't know what to do here.
"
3,4,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
2,8,Cartman,"It is not!
"
1,7,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children. Let's all gather around and bob for stupid apples now. You go first, Bebe.  That's good, just use those mouth muscles like the girls in Beijing.
"
17,1,Butters,"We're just goin' through the neighborhood an' seein' if you've accepted the government into your heart.
"
6,1,Stan,"That's true. Jared did like a hundred for Subway Sandwiches.
"
15,9,Butters,"Olé!
"
12,5,Cartman,"Yes! And abortion is the ultimate form of chea-ting! You're chea-ting nature itself.  Why do rich white girls get ahead in life? Because they get abortionnns when they're young. They get pregnant, but they still want to go to college, so, whatever, they just cheat. They cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life.
"
3,17,Stan,"No, they'll catch on. Hey, wait a minute. I've got a great idea. Let's make up our own word. We can make up a word, and then use it, ...and then they'll act like they know it, and then we'll bust 'em.
"
18,7,Cartman,"And then, and then he, he took off the shop goggles, and he was all like, ""Whoa, I'm back.""  Damn it if it's not the awesomest thing ever!
"
16,12,Kyle,"You're gonna see it.  WILL SOMEBODY GET ME A GOD DAMNED CHARGER?
"
11,14,Kyle,"Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no?  You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!
"
6,5,Butters,"They have to show it! They promised they would!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Okay, good. You're all here.
"
13,5,Cartman,"You've gotta let Jimmy go, it's all my fault.
"
3,14,Kyle,"Hello. I'm Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States.
"
4,11,Cartman,"You're gonna send me to hell?
"
18,1,Stan,"Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge!
"
18,1,Stan,"I'm pretty sure that's taken, Cartman.
"
4,1,Kyle,"I don't start, you start.
"
7,10,Cartman,"I believe that's us... thank God. 
"
3,8,Stan,"No, you guys are gonna have a great time! Whenever there's a party, the adults get to hang out and have fun while the kids spend the night locked in the basement eating stale pretzels.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Who the hell is that?
"
5,3,Cartman,"No you're not.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Here we go! The bomb shelter's down here! 
"
6,14,Stan,"Chef, we're intolerant. 
"
7,13,Cartman,"If I go, you guys go!
"
4,15,Kyle,"Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. 
"
10,2,Butters,"Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this.
"
4,1,Stan,"Oh, uhyeah.  Hello, Mr. Governor, and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws, entitled, ""Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy.""  Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.
"
11,13,Stan,"No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
13,13,Kyle,"Will somebody shut him up?
"
2,5,Kyle,"Here, Pip, you throw. 
"
3,17,Cartman,"Ooooh.
"
13,6,Stan,"No, Dad-
"
13,13,Butters,"That does it! Our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with!
"
3,10,Kenny,"(No!)
"
3,2,Kyle,"It's too bad Cartman can't be here to enjoy this.
"
4,10,Stan,"Waiwaiwaiwaiwait. ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's...""
"
8,1,Stan,"Oh my God, look!  Martial arts weapons from the Far East. 
"
5,1,Kyle,"Hey, Butters!  I got tickets to go see Lion King tonight, and I decided to invite  YOU before anybody else.
"
2,8,Stan,"So, we'll have ten M-80s, please.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Dude, what's happening?
"
8,6,Kenny,"What the hell is going on, you guys?
"
13,13,Cartman,"Yes, and that makes- whoa whoa what?
"
17,9,Kyle,"Well, unfortunately for us, he's now on the other side! We are out of options!
"
2,5,Stan,"Dude, it's the freak nurse!
"
18,1,Kyle,"Yeah. Good luck with yours. 
"
13,3,Kyle,"Hey! Hey, stop it! Stop!
"
9,10,Kyle,"It's just that... I really need this A, Stan. And Bebe did say you almost broke your last egg.
"
9,3,Stan,"Hi, Mr. Lu Kim? Uh hi, it's Wing's agents. Everything's fine, yeah, but we're supposed to arrive in Los Angeles in about four hours. Listen, does your wife ever eat? Or anything?
"
9,8,Randy,"We, we didn't listen!  Come on! Everyone grab what you can! We have to walk! 
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"""Stinky Britches"" by Alanis Morissette?
"
12,3,Kyle,"No.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Don't be nervous, Cartman. This is gonna be cake.
"
4,14,Kyle,"You ready for the big show, Timmy?
"
1,7,Stan,"Thanks a lot, Wendy! You ruined my Halloween!
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh really?
"
1,1,Kyle,"We told you they were real Cartman. Sorry to hear about your ass.
"
6,2,Stan,"Okay.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Look, we don't have a lot of time here, okay? Can you just tell us where the new Prime Minister is?
"
6,12,Stan,"Because our names were called on the commercial last night!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Well let's just suck it up, guys. All we can try to do is have a positive attitude about it. 
"
13,7,Cartman,"I said, get off my boat!
"
6,10,Cartman,"And this is Precious.
"
11,11,Stan,"What is this place?
"
5,13,Stan,"I can't, I just can't.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Okay. 
"
13,6,Stan,"Dad, we're not allowed to add anything to the car that doesn't come in the approved kit, remember?
"
15,13,Kyle,"You know, could youuu...
"
3,14,Cartman,"Hooray for the South!
"
10,8,Cartman,"Everyone hold! 
"
4,8,Kyle,"Our main point is that the flag shouldn't offend anyone, because killing has been around since the beginning of time. All animals kill.  And the animals that don't kill are stupid ones, like cows and turtles and stuff. So people should not be so upset about killing. 
"
9,6,Cartman,"My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we've really become friends.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, you can't get AIDS from just sitting around, you have to get it from sex.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Aw man, here we go again! Use the Jew as a scapegoat.
"
11,3,Kyle,"It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
"
14,8,Stan,"Dude, you are so retarded!
"
6,14,Mr. Mackey,"Well there is an intensive seminar camp. It's a bit severe, but it might be the only way. M'kay?
"
8,2,Cartman,"Yes.  And instead you had to break through yourself. This is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life, Kyle.  Good luck. 
"
11,5,Stan,"Oh no... 
"
12,12,Stan,"Dad, your boss called. He said you're fired.
"
7,5,Kyle,"I hate you. 
"
16,6,Stan,"And it was like WHAM. 
"
3,12,Kyle,"Yeah. They're tryin' to scare everybody 'cause they're gay wads.
"
8,1,Stan,"Goddamn, that's like the twelfth time that's worked.
"
6,1,Cartman,"No it isn't, stupid blubberbutt!
"
6,16,Kyle,"Hey, what happens to me in the future?
"
14,8,Cartman,"The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!
"
6,9,Stan,"Yuh, you guys okay. 
"
8,11,Stan,"We showed the shocking footage to the principal!
"
18,5,Kyle,"No, I was taking a crap, and I heard you guys talking!
"
11,11,Butters,"Oh hamburgers! 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Come on, kitties. Outside. Come on.  That's it. Come on, come on.  Uh oh.
"
1,12,Cartman,"I'm trying to get my tri- wait a minute, I'm not talking to you. Ike, will you tell Kyle that I was trying to get my triangle back?
"
18,2,Cartman,"Sir, the pyramid is upside down.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Oh boy.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Help! Help! 
"
1,8,Mr. Garrison,"Exactly.
"
9,10,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison..., you've never been this cool to me before.
"
10,3,Kyle,"That's it? That's all they did?
"
6,13,Jimmy,"They're taking it to the vi... the vi... the vii...
"
2,3,Cartman,"Ooohhhh.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food.
"
4,1,Stan,"Dude, this is horrible. We gotta get Cartman out of court so we can go practice.
"
16,6,Kyle,"It's no use. There's nobody around for miles.
"
3,13,Stan,"Come on, Pip, say it. Say ""Please, hit me.""
"
10,1,Kyle,"Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef?  Chef?
"
10,8,Cartman,"All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30.  We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!
"
4,16,Butters,"Hey! Here they come! 
"
15,14,Cartman,"Okay, fine!  I'm white trash and I'm in trouble!
"
1,5,Stan,"Do you have anything besides just animals with four asses?
"
7,3,Kenny,"(Yeah, maybe we should.)
"
17,2,Randy,"...I don't get it.
"
4,13,Stan,"Then we have to stop it before it gets there! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"What? Fuck Kyle.  Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we'll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Wow uh, you think it takes forty dollars to get people to like me.
"
11,12,Stan,"I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye.  Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.
"
1,9,Mr. Mackey,"Now I also understand that you're Jewish. Is that right, Kyle?
"
18,8,Stan,"Not with his Shapeshifter. It already attacked.
"
8,4,Stan,"All right, so you're sure he can dance?
"
17,10,Wendy,"Cheer Squad roll call! 
"
16,3,Cartman,"I guess the only thing that doesn't change in life... is that things change.  The sun hurts my eyes. 
"
2,15,Randy,"Why'd you take his pants off?  Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?
"
13,14,Kyle,"Aahhh...
"
15,14,Cartman,"A joke?! You think being poor is a joke?!
"
8,13,Butters,"Wuh be careful, Kyle.
"
18,7,Cartman,"You got the money?  Okay great, Butters. Now get back to the access point.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, I'm showin' the guys!  Check it out. Eavesdropper got a hold of the phone call from the nurse to Pete Melman's mom.  Just listen, listen listen.
"
18,1,Cartman,"How is it offensive?
"
6,12,Cartman,"You know, maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us is a J-O-O.
"
2,18,Kyle,"I'm here to bust out Steve.
"
6,16,Butters,"Poop- poop swatches?
"
5,11,Stan,"What the hell was that?
"
5,10,Cartman,"What's goin' on?
"
11,14,Kyle,"But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. 
"
4,17,Stan,"That's not in the script  They do this all the time.
"
1,13,Cartman,"You know, jus'... layin' down some rhymes for G-folk, you know what I'm sayin'?
"
9,2,Randy,"Which cord is it?
"
12,14,Butters,"Yeah, I guess.
"
18,2,Wendy,"Is that why you told Clyde that you broke up with me? Because you're about to be  ""dripping in bitches""?!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Because they don't fucking care! I've told you this! They don't give a shit about the students, and they live to make us miserable!
"
1,4,Kyle,"Hey Stan, isn't that your dog?
"
15,11,Randy,"D'augh. Do you remember the night after we saw ""Wicked""?
"
18,1,Kyle,"What the hell is wrong? ""Can't find the server"" Kickstarter. 
"
2,10,Cartman,"Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!
"
4,3,Kenny,"(I'm singing as good as I can!)
"
4,12,Wendy,"You guys don't actually think this is going to work, do you?
"
1,13,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I guess we should go, Mr. Hat.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls,  you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am  never going to suck your balls,  never! So  there!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle?  Asscheeks!  Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition.
"
16,5,Butters,"Can I, can I not do this, please?  I don't wanna do this.
"
2,14,Stan,"We've gotta help him, dude.
"
3,17,Stan,"Yeah, mung.
"
4,1,Stan,"Well, why don't you tell the governor yourself?
"
2,16,Cartman,"Ow!
"
2,9,Kyle,"Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys. 
"
1,5,Kyle,"Uh, oh, this, this is, the new retarded kid.
"
7,6,Stan,"His plan was to use a hammer.
"
10,8,Kyle,"Who is that guy?
"
1,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey!  Where the hell did you go?
"
8,11,Jimmy,"P- Principal Victoria, can you explain how your administration fuh-failed to see this p-p-pro-o-o... p-p-problem.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Did you see that? Token was gonna push her, but then he tickled her instead. 
"
18,7,Butters,"I feel Stan! He looks totally real!
"
12,7,Wendy,"I can't get a dial tone. 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Really? You will?
"
7,10,Randy,"Get off the streets! Get off the streets! Old people are driving!  Gerald! Where are the boys?!
"
3,2,Stan,"Oh.
"
2,16,Cartman,"I guess, damn! 
"
15,7,Butters,"Yeah! Open mine first Stan! It's the red one! 
"
11,9,Randy,"I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon? 
"
13,10,Butters,"Let's do this!
"
4,15,Cartman,"Don't touch me! 
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike, is that chewing tobacco?
"
6,3,Butters,"Lobster Boy?
"
7,8,Stan,"Wow, is that from Origins?
"
13,12,Butters,"That's because you guys never understood!  You fellers never got what these people are really about! Freedom! Rebellion against the system! A living image of independence! Solid, defiant, and supremely cool, the biker is an All-American icon of resilient individuality and freedom.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Do you like to put fishsticks in your mouth?
"
16,8,Cartman,"Butters, do you think your goo might work on someone else?
"
4,9,Randy,"You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL! 
"
4,11,Cartman,"Oh my God!!
"
13,12,Stan,"Really nice work, guys.
"
8,10,Cartman,"We did it!  So long, Trent! Have a nice time!  Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!  Hahahahahaaahaaa! 
"
16,1,Randy,"That's what that hole is for? Oh.  Oops.
"
17,2,Kyle,"Guys, guys, I know we're all concerned, but we have to work together!
"
6,9,Stan,"Aw, really?
"
8,1,Stan,"Oh, Jesus.
"
9,8,Kyle,"Chinese radicals?
"
11,4,Kyle,"...Maybe. 
"
13,4,Randy,"There's a time in our lives when we must listen to the oppressed.
"
3,3,Stan,"Right.
"
1,1,Stan,"Whoa, Cartman! Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
"
12,8,Butters,"A gun?
"
12,13,Stan,"What am I supposed to do? Can't just sit back and watch some kid steal my girlfriend away.  I mean, Wendy said she'd never leave me for him.  But what if she just doesn't wanna hurt my feelings? She said he could get any girl he wants, and that means if he wanted, he could have my girl.  This is all so crazy. I mean really, how could my day get any worse?  No-no, no, I'm not doing it! I'm not doing it!
"
8,11,Kyle,"Another devastating loss for the Cows last night, Eric. They were ahead in the game until Kelly Anderson started crying because she missed her daddy, who's on a business trip in Thailand. Uh, Kelly was so upset she couldn't play, and the Cows had to forfeit.
"
7,6,Stan,"It's that thing we learned about in school where you pull on your wiener until white stuff comes out.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Mom? Where's my mom?
"
6,5,Cartman,"That's it? That's all the commercials?
"
10,10,Cartman,"Hands?! Let me see those hands!
"
9,3,Kyle,"Ma'am, we are a very important talent agency. If your producers knew you were forcing people of our stature to the back of the line, well-
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yes. I did! 
"
10,10,Cartman,"Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!
"
3,9,Kyle,"Go, Ike!
"
9,6,Butters,"Hello, ma'am. May I talk to you?
"
6,17,Jimmy,"On the el- el- el- eleventh of C- Christmas my t...true love gave to me, e-eleven p-p-pipers p-pu-p-piping...
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I... guess you could. 
"
2,10,Randy,"See ya, son. 
"
5,4,Kyle,"Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Quick! Are you ready?! We gotta jump!
"
5,8,Stan,"Goddamnit, what now?!
"
16,4,Butters,"Oh good. Maybe we scared it off?
"
17,2,Randy,"Oh. Well okay, great.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Yeah! Let's see how they like it!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Alright!
"
18,9,Stan,"Yeah?
"
1,7,Wendy,"I know, but then... I guess I just realized how stupid we would look.
"
4,2,Cartman,"It's better than your dress! You look like a bad Jennifer Lopez nightmare!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Informative if you want to die.  Gusy, don't forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that's all.  Look, I'm just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you're all sleepin' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They're gonna GETCHA! 
"
4,8,Cartman,"Really? Mine too. What I really like to do, is I like to take the tops off of two cookies, and then put them together and make ""quadruple stuffs.""
"
16,13,Stan,"Well, we wanted to start a new movement, and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets...
"
8,3,Stan,"Thank you.  This must be the place.  Goddamn, Mel Gibson must be loaded. 
"
6,14,Cartman,"Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! 
"
6,17,Cartman,"Hooray!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Hey, what the fuck, dude?! Do you mind? This is occupied!
"
16,6,Stan,"Good. How are you?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters. 
"
6,12,Stan,"Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle's right. We gotta spark the vision somehow.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Yes. Yes I will. If Kyle will kiss my black ass. 
"
4,9,Randy,"Get in the truck! 
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmy.
"
15,8,Cartman,"I-I'll try. I'll try. 
"
4,12,Kenny,"(Those titties are fuckin' huge!) 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?
"
3,17,Stan,"Oh, brother. Let's just get out of here.
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Yes, good Flora, you remembered the Filthy Sanchez.
"
2,8,Stan,"The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
"
11,1,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, be quiet!
"
16,10,Cartman,"No, everything's not all right. How come a guy from India is calling me when my house is being broken into?!
"
6,10,Stan,"That's different, dude. You're like, my girlfriend. Bebe's just... I don't know. She's just cool. 
"
12,7,Cartman,"They must have realized we left. Damn.
"
2,7,Stan,"Yeah, I dreamt that Cartman dreamt that we were all trapped on a bus, and then he dreamt that we were talking about things that had happened, only they were all wrong, and, and then he and his mother ate beetles.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, ""Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!"" Okay?
"
7,5,Kyle,"Come here!  You're not actually buying this crap, are you?!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Look out, Artemus Clyde Frog! It's a giant metal spider!  Bang! Bangbang!  Yoyoyo, jiggity jiggy with it! Bang bang bang!  We saved the day! The Wild Wild West, The Wild Wild Wild West. Uhyo wicky wicky scratch, Uh wicky wicky scratch... 
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"The Founding Fathers would have protested like us!
"
1,1,Stan,"Chef!
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"I'll never forget you, Mr. Twig. Thank you. 
"
10,6,Kyle,"Forget it! They can't hear us!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Well, there's everything, Butters.  I've made everything right.
"
13,5,Cartman,"So then I can say, ""What are you, a gay fish?""
"
9,2,Cartman,"Well, your attic could be so we can fumigate with polymarethane. The drum circle we're gonna have to gas.  God dammit! 
"
6,8,Cartman,"Hm.
"
8,4,Stan,"Please, you guys, our whole town's reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?
"
5,1,Kyle,"Right. But in the 1340s people in England stopped calling it ""skite"" and started calling it ""shit."" The same year as the Black Plague.
"
6,4,Stan,"We're just gonna have to carry them one by one.  Come on, you guys. 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny.
"
12,7,Kyle,"What's the number to dial out?
"
7,3,Kyle,"Don't you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn't look obvious.
"
6,10,Randy,"Yes, ahta. Let's have a talk, Stan.
"
12,1,Kyle,"What hope?!
"
17,9,Stan,"So, better a PS4 than nothing, is that it? I think we'll take our chances on our own. 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Yeah. We won't have to take crap from anybody.
"
5,14,Butters,"Naw, I'm lyin'
"
13,14,Randy,"Oh my God. I've gotta help him! 
"
3,14,Cartman,"So, you guys about ready to start being my slaves yet?
"
12,8,Stan,"Indiana Jones! All right! 
"
18,7,Cartman,"I'm not here, Butters.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Think of the power!
"
17,6,Cartman,"Oh would you- Would you guys like to see it?
"
2,4,Stan,"Kyle! You have to stop them!
"
7,1,Stan,"Where to now, Chef?
"
2,11,Cartman,"Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!
"
4,2,Stan,"Look, the tooth fairy is all made up, right?
"
16,6,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
16,5,Cartman,"Still balls.
"
13,14,Randy,"It's the pee!  It's all pee, and nobody can go in or out!
"
18,2,Stan,"Wait, wait, ah I might need those.
"
11,9,Stan,"What is wrong with that guy?
"
11,14,Wendy,"It doesn't matter how incredible they are; you can't- Oh my God, those are amazing.
"
1,2,Kyle,"Uh oh, we're losing him. 
"
8,10,Kyle,"The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.
"
2,10,Stan,"How does someone get herpes?
"
11,12,Stan,"Kyle? What's happening?
"
18,9,Kyle,"Meh? Ike, we have a whole day to play XBox! Mom and Dad are leaving!
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Everyonen get some sheets from home! If we can't chase the richers out, we'll spook 'em out!
"
4,10,Stan,"Dude, this lady told us if you don't confess all your sins and you don't eat crackers and drink wine, then you go to hell. Period.
"
4,12,Stan,"What a bitch!
"
6,10,Stan,"Hellafun
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Well yeah, but see, the problem is not everyone is not everyone is signed on to it yet.
"
8,13,Kyle,"Because you're a fucking fatass, that's why!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Are you Teabag?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, why d-uh, did you?
"
5,6,Stan,"You can't keep us out forever, you fucking fat ass! We'll be back as soon as Kyle's hemorrhoid is better!
"
3,4,Stan,"He's really got it out for you, dude.
"
1,5,Kenny,"(Or are you gonna hit her with your hand?)
"
2,18,Stan,"All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this? 
"
6,12,Kyle,"Whoa.  Kenny, you in there?
"
5,3,Stan,"Wow.
"
2,12,Wendy,"Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Washington. Redskins. 
"
11,7,Stan,"We think this may be our friend's fault.  He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-
"
9,2,Cartman,"I know hippies. I've hated them all my life. I've kept this town free of hippies on my own since I was five and a half. But I can't contain them on my own anymore. We have to do something, fast!
"
6,13,Cartman,"Jews can't be Paladins.
"
15,9,Cartman,"Ey!
"
5,2,Stan,"It's gonna suck. There's gonna be like, new kids there we don't know.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmy!
"
14,4,Kyle,"I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
"
10,4,Kyle,"You just want Family Guy off the air...
"
11,2,Butters,"Because I'm bi-curious?
"
13,3,Randy,"What is this? What's going on?
"
6,1,Kyle,"You have to! Here, have some more mayonnaise. 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Pfaha, so funny. 
"
16,13,Stan,"Exactly! People don't even know where it is.
"
6,7,Stan,"Wow. How did that happen?
"
11,2,Stan,"Come on, let's go. 
"
18,6,Randy,"Oh pass interference! Interference! 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Well, that should be fine, just fine. 
"
14,11,Randy,"I don't know.
"
7,12,Randy,"We have that, Stan. It's called Friday Night Kegger.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles! 
"
17,7,Cartman,"Fuck you, dude! This is the Garden of Andros!
"
16,6,Kyle,"Jesus Christ!
"
8,11,Stan,"The cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring Middle Park Elementary. But they took action: ridded their entire town of cough medicine, and what we see now is a happier school, 100% cough medicine-free. 
"
12,8,Butters,"But I was just trying to stop him, and you said-
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium.
"
14,3,Cartman,"I...  told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.
"
7,10,Kenny,"(Oooooo my God!) 
"
7,1,Stan,"But sirs, we think our show is just getting good.  I mean, we're just now starting to see people get really pissed off at each other.
"
8,5,Cartman,"I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?
"
8,5,Butters,"Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It's a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.
"
2,8,Stan,"Hey, Chef!
"
3,10,Kyle,"Huh?
"
7,3,Stan,"Weelll, art is just kinda... for gaywads.
"
4,6,Kyle,"We don't WANNA go!
"
12,8,Cartman,"No no, you got it wrong. We aren't the Chinese, we're the good gu-  AAH!  Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
15,2,Cartman,"Except for Jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world?
"
8,5,Stan,"Dude, are you still pretending to be a robot?
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, thanks Token. 
"
2,11,Cartman,"Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, and, I'm a hero. 
"
13,11,Stan,"What? Dude, we're trying to get to some whales.
"
13,6,Stan,"Oh no, he didn't.
"
1,11,Cartman,"Noh, he always pukes when he's in love.
"
14,3,Cartman,"We had a little problem.
"
10,9,Cartman,"Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2!  When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur,  but when I computer-enhanced it,  You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole.
"
1,8,Cartman,"Oh well, back to the poor country with you.
"
11,11,Stan,"No.
"
16,5,Butters,"Mm, but this is just gonna make things worse for me.
"
1,9,Stan,"Lights, please.  And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.  And lo, an angel of the Lord came upon them, and they were sore afraid, and the angel said unto them, 'Fear not, for behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, for born unto you this day in the city of...David is the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Lord.  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill towards men'And now, South Park Elementary presents the Birth of Jesus
"
7,3,Cartman,"You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. 
"
18,8,Randy,"Now, some of you might think that this is a little crazy, but if you believe in magic...  you'll find that-  Ow! Ow! Oh God! Can somebody help, please!
"
1,1,Wendy,"Hi, Stan.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning.
"
9,5,Stan,"Look, you guys, maybe it's not all that bad.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(che, io lo so,)
"
1,12,Stan,"Dude. Shut up, Cartman.
"
7,15,Randy,"Yeah. Who needs more stuff, anyway? This Christmas we can do somethin' that really matters!
"
1,11,Stan,"Yup.
"
8,13,Kyle,"No.
"
15,4,Randy,"...Ah, good question. Ahh, the penis is the thing we're talking about that boys have that we're... measuring.  Okay any other questions? Okay, so then let's move on to the example on your study sheet. How about you? Could you read the first example for the class?  Example 1, young lady. Please read the problem out loud
"
16,10,Kyle,"The Jewish population isn't dying out, fatass! It's growing!
"
3,4,Kyle,"Yeah. And then Craig's family came on and said Tweek was the wuss, and then punched Tweek's mom in the hooters.
"
8,10,Kyle,"Wait! We'll do it.
"
17,3,Cartman,"I wrote a poem. Is it okay if I read my poem?  It's called ""I Was Not The Bullet."" 
I was not the bullet. I was not the gun.
I was not the juror that set the shooter free.
I was not the trigger. I was not the hate.
Nor was I the judge, but still, you judge me?
I was not the black family mourning for the dead.
""Oooo, somebody shot our children. Lordy, what we do now?""
I was not the verdict.
"
11,2,Cartman,"It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be soo stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
"
11,8,Kyle,"Aw, come on!
"
16,3,Stan,"Go, go, go.
"
10,2,Randy,"That's it. That's that the last one.
"
3,12,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
14,8,Cartman,"Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?!  ""In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss.""  Oh my God, Butters...  we need Vagisil!
"
6,17,Cartman,"But I'll still be getting presents this year, right?
"
18,6,Jimmy,"What all the addiction programs say is true. You've gotta reach out to a higher power, Stan. You've gotta get down on your knees, and you've gotta say ""I have a problem."" And you've gotta ask that higher power for help. 
"
3,5,Stan,"We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!
"
1,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
"
11,13,Cartman,"Stan, you guys are good! 
"
16,8,Butters,"'At's in there. It's overflowing sometimes. 
"
8,7,Cartman,"It's a deal! All right, guys, let's get to work!  Yeah, it's so totally awesome. Craig crapped his pants when he saw it. Yeah, sweet. So what's goin' on over there? Yeah, that's pretty cool.  No way! He did not! Aw dude, that is so weak.  What?
"
8,4,Butters,"What?
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Don't lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship. You know as well as I do most of the kids in Special Olympics aren't shooting up to compete. I'm just trying to k-keep up.
"
12,14,Kyle,"Butters, there's no such things as vampires.
"
1,6,Kyle,"Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever.
"
18,9,Cartman,"This is the way of the future, Mr. Garrison.
"
13,14,Cartman,"...What do you mean?
"
8,11,Stan,"Crab people?
"
5,6,Cartman,"On my dream.  On the one thing that I've wanted ever since I could remember...
"
14,6,Stan,"We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!
"
14,10,Wendy,"Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called ""hoarding."" People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore.
"
2,2,Cartman,"Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!
"
2,13,Kyle,"Wait a minute! I've got it! The bullriding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5000.  Think about it, dude: $5000. That's 1000 set of balls. That's 3000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!
"
10,3,Randy,"Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!
"
4,12,Stan,"Stupid third grader!
"
1,4,Kyle,"You're on, dude. 
"
4,15,Kyle,"What's the matter?
"
15,7,Stan,"No, you don't understand dude. Something's happened. Tween Wave doesn't sound the same to me.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Guys... Uh... Uh... 
"
17,2,Butters,"I called the networks that are putting this smut out there, and you know what they told me?! They told me if I didn't want my parents watchin', then I should spend more time with them! Like it's my fault!
"
2,4,Kyle,"He's not my brother!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials.
"
16,14,Stan,"I don't understand that stuff at all. I need Morgan Freeman to explain it to me.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Good guess, dude!
"
8,9,Cartman,"That's ten bucks you owe me, dick-face!
"
1,9,Mr. Mackey,"Well it-it's my understanding that you umhm, yu-you have an acute case of fecophilia.
"
17,8,Cartman,"Uhh, it's my Lord Wizard King, actually. Having your leadership has certainly been a help.  But I hope that we're clear that this is my army.  There can only be one person of royalty; that's kind of the rules.
"
16,6,Stan,"There could be a helicopter. Maybe one will fly overhead.
"
6,1,Butters,"Uh, hey, fellas.
"
7,3,Butters,"Well, he kept accusin' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Puhah! You guys don't follow Eavesdropper?   It's a Web site about all the students in the school! 
"
10,3,Randy,"We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning,  then we'll know we're not dead.
"
16,6,Kyle,"And then like, out of nowhere, somebody came up with the idea of ziplining.
"
6,4,Stan,"Yeah, don't you see? This validates everything that we're doing. If we're making the news, then this is obviously important to people.
"
18,9,Randy,"You can't just replace artists with holograms. Who will make the content?
"
9,8,Butters,"Hey, everybody, they just found out what caused the flood in Beaverton! 
"
9,12,Randy,"Hello?  Hey, come out of there!
"
18,7,Butters,"How much more of this am I supposed to clear up?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Puh- pussy!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Yeah! That's the Pirates of the Caribbean. Ugh.
"
8,5,Butters,"Who's at the door, AWESOM-O? 
"
1,4,Kyle,"Cartman farted!
"
10,8,Cartman,"I'm going as fast as I can!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Just, could I talk to you, real quick?  What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Token?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw.  We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Ooooo! Boxing's scary, you guys!  I'm gonna have Craig learn martial arts!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Okay, you can come with us.
"
8,3,Stan,"I don't care! You sound like a little bitch to me!
"
10,14,Stan,"No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?
"
6,8,Cartman,"Kyle, could you help me out? I need some advice. 
"
14,4,Randy,"Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Butters?! You're gonna take THAT butt hole?! Why?!
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Me? ...Like, like what?
"
1,11,Kyle,"Oh cool.
"
17,9,Butters,"Hey, fellas. What did I miss? 
"
5,10,Cartman,"Let me see! 
"
1,10,Kyle,"Somebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.
"
1,12,Kyle,"You threw it away, fatso!
"
14,4,Stan,"How?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Hooray!  Yes. I'm gonna have your and your boyfriend's voices on my Speak and Record bear, and then you'll mostly never babysit me again! Mostly.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Heeeey! 
"
18,9,Randy,"Shelly, there's a good chance Lorde isn't goin' to show up.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Nothing.
"
4,6,Stan,"Blaaa-lalalalalalala.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Yes, but whose idea was it to take the answers out of Garrison's desk?
"
3,1,Cartman,"Bad! That's a bad snay-ah! 
"
9,5,Stan,"Goddamnit... 
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yeah. 
"
16,12,Cartman,"We're actually on our way over to Kyle's because our costumes are so multi-faceted and cool we have to put them on together.
"
2,11,Stan,"Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
"
5,9,Cartman,"Hur-ry, get into wardrobe!  Oh hur-ry up, will you hur-ry?!  Oh, you look marvelous, dahling.
"
9,11,Kenny,"(What's a great idea?)
"
10,14,Stan,"My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. 
"
12,7,Butters,"Whoa! 
"
16,10,Kyle,"Dude, come down here!
"
6,1,Stan,"Dude, bail! 
"
2,8,Stan,"Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard.
"
1,11,Wendy,"That mean old substitute isn't going to stop until she takes everything from me, Bebe.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Yeah. It's not a very satisfying feeling.
"
8,13,Cartman,"I was given my gift from a tragic accident. I didn't need to go to Psychic Detective School.
"
6,1,Butters,"Wo-ah I'm getting steamed now. 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!
"
12,12,Stan,"Jesus Christ...
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here, so you must be talkin' to me.  I'll take it!
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey, what are you guys doing here?
"
11,14,Kyle,"Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
"
14,6,Kyle,"Come on, Muhammad, the door is open.
"
17,7,Randy,"I did, Sharon.  I saw they were hiring extra security, and I thought it'd be a good way to make money.
"
5,2,Cartman,"Yeah, we learned how to make cakes and muffins for our bake sale.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Don't worry. I know what to do.
"
12,11,Stan,"Craig, dude, wait up.
"
7,3,Stan,"So what should we do?
"
15,1,Kyle,"Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff. They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right? 
"
15,5,Kyle,"You can't do this! We were gonna build an orphanage! So the crack babies have somewhere to go!
"
18,5,Cartman,"What did you say?
"
4,11,Kyle,"Yes!
"
14,14,Cartman,"Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!
"
9,9,Kyle,"I don't wanna know when I'm going to die, fatass! 
"
8,6,Cartman,"You feel bad for him?! He has everything a kid could want!
"
1,6,Mr. Garrison,"I thought you just came from the bathroom.
"
11,3,Butters,"Heh hey guys, what would I do?
"
5,2,Timmy,"Lah-livin' a lie!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"What's the matter is this Funnybot has taken the humanity out of comedy. I don't think things are better, I think they're worse.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Whoa.
"
3,10,Stan,"It's starting, it's starting!
"
1,2,Stan,"Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest.
"
6,13,Cartman,"I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands.
"
2,15,Stan,"I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
"
18,9,Kyle,"Well what are you watching?
"
12,3,Cartman,"Dude, he's getting super-wasted on life.
"
9,1,Stan,"Dude, you were awesome, Kyle.  Look, y-you gave it your best shot, right? That's all you could do. 
"
7,4,Randy,"Nobody wants to here another pro-war country song!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Yeah, but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault!
"
1,9,Cartman,"Let me see! 
"
14,6,Cartman,"Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?
"
6,13,Kyle,"The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Hard to port, lads!
"
5,8,Kyle,"I'm supposed to go to the lake with my family tomorrow and swim and play in the stupid sun.
"
10,7,Cartman,"She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?!  All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked.  You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom.
"
4,6,Kyle,"Yeah.  HEY, WHEN ARE WE GONNA GET TO SOME ACTION, HUH?
"
14,14,Stan,"You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!
"
9,13,Kyle,"You don't understand! Willzy-x is from the moon! He'll die if we don't get him back, now! Willzy-x, you have to talk! Come on boy, you have to! I know you're sick, but you could do it!
"
2,13,Stan,"Hoh, yeah. That's a good idea. 
"
12,1,Butters,"Oh, uh-okay, it's clear.
"
2,16,Stan,"Oh ooh.
"
11,2,Butters,"How come uh, I can't see?
"
3,5,Cartman,"He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left. 
"
4,1,Kyle,"Dude, I guess we've just got to try it without him.
"
1,6,Kyle,"But won't your grampa be there?
"
6,3,Cartman,"Shhh. Be quite, you guys!  Hello, is this Maury Povish?  Oh, well who the hell are you?  Oh. Well I'm calling about your ad for freaks?  Ye-right, people with disabilities?  Yeah, I have a friend; he has a deformity; I think he'd be perfect for your show.  Great!  Hih-his condition?  Uh, he has a condition called ""chinballalitis.""  Yeah, his balls actually hang from his chin.  Shut uh- shut up you guys.  Yes.  Yes, of course he's very upset about it.  Yes, he cries all the time.  Miserable, uh huh.  You wha- Really?
"
4,1,Kyle,"Well, that didn't work. What else can we try?
"
15,14,Cartman,"Yeah, that's where I requested to be sent.
"
6,1,Butters,"Aahh heh ahh, I don't feel very good.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Have no fear, for God is near
And God loves all his children
Huh?  Nooooooo!  Kyle, why? What are you doing?
"
6,16,Stan,"No.
"
1,1,Stan,"Really, what about?
"
9,9,Wendy,"I know. Let's do ""Light as a feather, stiff as a board.""  Who wants to do it first?
"
6,7,Cartman,"Okay. I've added the water purifier tablet to the Sea People Kingdom tank. Now it says  ""Step 2.  Add the Sea People eggs to the water; you will see sea life spring instantly.""  Okay, let's just run through this one more time: when the sea people arrive I will welcome them to South Park as Ambassador of Earth. Tweek, you give them the key to the city, and we'll all engage them in simple conversation. We've gotta make sea people feel comfortable, okay? Ready?
"
8,3,Cartman,"It's okay, Kyle. It's okay. Just... say that first part again?
"
7,12,Cartman,"Damn, that kid is cool, huh?
"
16,12,Stan,"Just have a good Halloween, you guys. And Kenny?
"
7,9,Butters,"...Ohhh!
"
1,4,Kyle,"Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.
"
5,13,Stan,"Stem cells?
"
13,9,Butters,"Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
"
15,14,Kenny,"(I'll be there, Karen.) 
"
10,1,Kyle,"Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Revenge is so very, very sweet.
"
8,11,Stan,"We took a bunch of cough medicine to come up with ideas for our show. I didn't come up with anything.
"
16,12,Randy,"No...
"
17,2,Stan,"No, that's way too long!
"
13,12,Butters,"I always thought, someday when I grow up I'm gonna get a Harley. Then people will have to notice me, and they'll have to deal with my shit for once. The open road! The wind on my face! I'll go from city to city! Rowrrowrroowwrr! Everyone lookin' at me! ""Who's that guy? He must be a Hoo- he must be tough!"" Vromvrom, vromvrom, vrooom! I'll have my girl on the back seat holdin' on to my fat belly - sure she's missin' a few teeth, but she thinks I'm coool. That's why, when I grow up, I'm gonna be a Harley rider!
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh yeah, nice going, replacement refs!
"
10,10,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
6,4,Kyle,"No!
"
11,12,Butters,"Ahhh shit.
"
14,3,Cartman,"I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want.
"
7,8,Kyle,"Mom!
"
1,1,Cartman,"God damn it! 
"
18,5,Cartman,"Not a word, Kenny!
"
7,3,Kenny,"(I think so too.)
"
11,7,Cartman,"Is nice to the homeless
Californiania
Supercool to the homeless
"
2,9,Cartman,"What kind of cookies?
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"How?  No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't kill Kathie Lee Gifford!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, where have you been?
"
18,8,Stan,"Dad, it's not that big a deal.
"
17,7,Cartman,"Butters, you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners.
"
10,8,Cartman,"Kyle! Fire spell!
"
16,14,Kyle,"Chr, what could you possibly have in your room that could change the outcome of the election? 
"
10,8,Kyle,"Ike, look out! 
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say banoo'n? Orange you glad I didn't say bbb? Orange you glad I didn't say beh buhuhnnnaana?
"
9,12,Randy,"Two hundred and forty dollars?! What'd you do, break something?!
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"Thank you for that presentation Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a ""D-"".
"
4,12,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sure I do.
"
11,4,Kyle,"No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?
"
18,3,Cartman,"He's cisginger! He's so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night!
"
18,9,Randy,"I'll do no such thing!
"
2,8,Kyle,"Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Heh! We're not paying nine ninety five!
"
2,11,Cartman,"Oh, dude, here it comes!
"
2,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh uh- hello, children.
"
4,9,Timmy,"Huhaaaaah!
"
9,8,Cartman,"Maybe you have the parking brake on.
"
5,8,Cartman,"No it isn't.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Heh, it's only about a thousand times better, am I right guys? Come on! We have to tell everybody fast! This is gonna be so funny!
"
15,13,Kyle,"Ack dude! 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Dude, I couldn't take anymore of that balloon. Another couple hours of that, and I would've been totally pissed off.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Hey. We paid for the sea people too. How come they're not making statues of us? 
"
4,3,Randy,"Well, Stan, it's not really our-
"
13,12,Kyle,"I know. It's like we have the outdoors back again.
"
12,2,Kyle,"We did it guys!
"
14,7,Stan,"Towelie, if you do not go to treatment, we will all ignore you forever. Will you go?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Okay, we'll try this again.  Hi, everyone. I am a young boy looking for fun times with older male. I like to-  Oh, this one looks good: HungDaddy.  Hello, HungDaddy.  ""Hi. I'm eight and a half inches."" Damn, dude, this guy's tiny. He must be a dwarf.  Sorry, I'm not interested in being friends with midgets.  Midgets piss me off. Frowny face.  Lemme see, how about this one?
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh, money... Rrright.  There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. 
"
1,1,Stan,"Good morning, Miss Crabtree.
"
2,9,Stan,"So what do we do now?
"
1,7,Stan,"Whoa, dude!
"
4,3,Stan,"That's your dad?
"
4,17,Stan,"Hey!  Wait a minute!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well, Eric, th-that's really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh.
"
15,10,Kyle,"That's not funny.
"
1,1,Cartman,"Ow!  That hurts, you buttlicker!
"
10,14,Stan,"What?
"
3,3,Kyle,"Thanks, Mr. Garrison.
"
11,7,Kyle,"That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
"
11,12,Butters,"AAAAAAAAA! No, nonono, no no no! 
"
3,11,Stan,"Uh, thanks.
"
16,13,Kyle,"Hey dude, people are kind of pissed off at you.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"I will, Ms. Social Worker. I will.  M'kay?
"
3,6,Kyle,"Hoh God, here we go.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Oh. Sure thing. Come on in.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Not much, just taking my  one million dollars out of the bank. 
"
1,12,Kyle,"Cartman?
"
3,2,Kenny,"(How about this?)
"
8,3,Cartman,"You know what it is? You're scared. You're scared of the truth. You don't want that movie to show you just how bad the Jews are, and why everyone hates you.
"
5,5,Stan,"Ah, I'm sorry, but the four of us can't help tomorrow night.
"
14,4,Stan,"Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.
"
18,9,Randy,"Ah ya ya. Okay, uh. Ah ya ya ya ya-a-a-a.  Okay, uh, uh...  Oooo! Oh yeah! Oh my clit! Oh yeah! Oooo yeah, flick that bean, yeah! 
"
17,10,Butters,"You're a liar!
"
9,9,Kyle,"Dude, it's been to long. Something's wrong.
"
18,9,Randy,"No, I don't, Iggy. I just think that our younger girl fans need something a little more positive as role models.
"
12,9,Butters,"But Wendy's coming to fight you.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Nonono, we're not going into one of those cheesy places, Cartman!
"
16,12,Kyle,"All right, where should we trick-or-treat first?
"
9,14,Stan,"No!
"
6,1,Stan,"What?!
"
8,9,Kyle,"You hate Wall-Mart, too? 
"
9,12,Stan,"...Huh??
"
4,1,Cartman,"Hey, Romper Stomper.
"
11,10,Stan,"No no I I hardly got any sleep. I had this whole messed up dream about some gay Mayor guy taking us to Imaginationland where all these imaginary characters live?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"No. I don't think that will solve any of our problems, though you seem to think it did.
"
18,2,Cartman,"We lure people in with a cause and then hit 'em over the head with the best party ever. We're gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band!
"
5,4,Cartman,"He said it was okay.
"
12,1,Kyle,"Well I've been thinking: maybe there's something you've come into contact with that hinders HIV from growing. Do you mind if we just look around?
"
1,10,Kyle,"Yeah, dude!
"
7,3,Kyle,"Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...
"
14,7,Kyle,"Oh my God!
"
18,7,Cartman,"You need to find your way back to my room. Can you do that??
"
7,6,Stan,"Sure.
"
16,11,Butters,"Why don't you shut up, Dad, and stick it in your ear, for cryin' out loud! 
"
2,18,Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAA! 
"
11,9,Stan,"So Bono's newest record is a lie!
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
15,5,Kyle,"There's a big wait to sit down.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don't seem to understand. We're we're not gonna get punished for this. Ever.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Theh-they're all just... jealous.
"
12,12,Kyle,"We NEED a ride to the hospital!
"
16,10,Cartman,"Uh, no, a man just broke into our house and he's about to rape my mom.  Go go, she's upstairs.  Hello, did you hear me? A rapist is here; he's white!
"
11,2,Cartman,"All right. It's a picture ...of me.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Craig just called you a boner!
"
1,4,Cartman,"That's right, you get back there.
"
3,4,Kyle,"And then Craig was all like, ""Tweek is scared o'me. He's a big chicken."" And he started doing an impersonation of you being a chicken;  well, everybody in the world saw it!
"
3,3,Kyle,"Yeah, so?
"
2,18,Kyle,"I've got something to show Steve, dick!
"
5,8,Kyle,"Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You've gotta move me closer! 
"
10,10,Kyle,"This is nuts.
"
9,14,Randy,"But, maybe... I'm just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing.
"
14,6,Stan,"We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!
"
4,1,Kyle,"Sweet! Let's go!
"
6,16,Stan,"Liver medicine?
"
8,8,Stan,"Dad, isn't this a little extreme?
"
18,8,Butters,"Yeah.
"
2,10,Stan,"Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo.
"
2,15,Stan,"Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?
"
1,13,Cartman,"God-dammit!! Do I have a dad?!
"
11,13,Stan,"Hero-Heroin Hero?
"
7,6,Stan,"Ms. Peterson, is your daughter home?
"
15,5,Kyle,"Jesus Christ.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Okay, that's enough fatass jokes for this week.
"
7,12,Cartman,"Oh my God...
"
15,7,Randy,"Uh... NO I mean...  I like it.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Yeah. And I can still get my A!
"
5,9,Stan,"Butters, what the hell are you doing?
"
6,2,Stan,"They're still asleep.
"
15,1,Kyle,"Dad! Dad, I need a lawyer!
"
13,4,Randy,"A girl at school, she... queefed on one of Stan's friends today. 
"
5,5,Cartman,"We've got to get them back together, you guys. They could do this to us.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
10,6,Randy,"It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?
"
15,14,Cartman,"Pretty much went through everybody. Craig's got the mo-  sh, sh sh sh sh. Here he comes, here he comes.  Heya, Craig, your uh... your family get you that jacket at Walmart or Kmart? 
"
7,15,Stan,"Yeah, dude. What if we miss out on some great Christmas adventure?
"
14,1,Stan,"I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!
"
11,3,Cartman,"He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen.  Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! 
"
18,5,Butters,"We took all kinds of video with his drone.
"
10,3,Cartman,"What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people.  What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!
"
13,14,Stan,"Kyle, it's just pee! It's not that big a deal!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Look at that, Mr. Slave.  Our cup runneth over.
"
13,1,Kyle,"This is serious. They've been going out for almost two weeks now.
"
16,7,Mr. Garrison,"Token, is there a problem? 
"
8,10,Stan,"Admit it was our fault?
"
2,12,Randy,"When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
"
10,11,Kyle,"I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true.
"
14,1,Cartman,"I told you this game was sweet, dude.
"
18,9,Randy,"How can I let her down? Do you mind finishing up here? I think I should practice a little.
"
17,7,Cartman,"Please tell her there is to be a meeting in the Great Hall. I have found a way to get XBox Ones, and the fair Lady McCormick will want to hear about it.
"
7,14,Butters,"Uh-okay. Uh, hey, Lexus, well, there's something I've been meaning to say.  Here it goes: Lexus, I- Oh jeeze, maybe I shouldn't say it- no wait, I want to say it. I love you.  Heeheee, heh, Oh my God.
"
15,1,Kyle,"...What?
"
1,1,Cartman,"Hey, that kind of looks like... Tom Selleck.
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"-okay uh I'm Counselor Mackey. Have you been smokin' marijawana? Marijawana's bad, mkay?
"
2,11,Cartman,"I did it! I did it!
"
6,12,Cartman,"I don't know. It's like my brain just keeps... jacking off.
"
3,5,Cartman,"If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Aw J-j-j-j...j-Jesus!
"
18,9,Kyle,"Yeah. You used to sit in the living room with family and friends to hear their commentary on things. Now you can get it with a l-
"
2,10,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell is that?
"
4,8,Stan,"Yeah, we don't see what the big deal is.
"
13,3,Butters,"Hi, Grandma!
"
4,7,Stan,"Jesus Christ! Alright, Butters, you take this medical book, and everyone follow me!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Oh, ""A I D E S,"" aides.
"
9,14,Randy,"What? What did I do?!  What did I do?!
"
9,5,Kyle,"Crud! 
"
2,11,Kyle,"He's not highly intelligent.
"
2,9,Mr. Garrison,"That's it Eric, you-!
"
4,9,Kyle,"Jews are tough!
"
4,14,Cartman,"I can't sleep, Mom! I have to write the lyrics for the opening song of our Helen Keller Thanksgiving spectacular!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, we're listenin' to it! 
"
10,9,Mr. Mackey,"Why, Clyde? Why did you do it?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss! 
"
7,3,Butters,"I love our class!
"
8,2,Stan,"Oh hey Jimmy, hey Timmy.
"
11,7,Stan,"Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Frosty, Steve, whatever.
"
7,7,Stan,"Ah! Oh, dude!
"
2,12,Stan,"Sweet!
"
18,7,Kenny,"(What??)
"
17,9,Stan,"Huh? Hello? Who is that? 
"
6,7,Stan,"Hey, these are brine shrimp. I used to feed them to my fish.
"
8,1,Stan,"We, we're brothers, see, and our parents... died in a car accident last year.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"But, Mr. Meryl, we're trying to bring the news to the students. They need to know the facts, and our news team delivers them, very much.
"
1,6,Cartman,"Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer.
"
12,6,Stan,"Hey! Mom!
"
8,4,Kyle,"That's right!
"
2,15,Randy,"Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. 
"
4,17,Cartman,"My moms barely bought me any presents so far.
"
1,7,Wendy,"Hi, Stan.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Oh, like you know what pain is! Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!
"
6,9,Kyle,"That's it!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!
"
3,7,Cartman,"I will! James West, cowboy and rap star!  Quick, Artemus Clyde Frog! We've got to save Salma Hayek!
"
2,13,Stan,"I'm startin' to think that maybe it's wrong to put someone who thinks they're a Vietnamese prostitute on a bull.
"
5,2,Stan,"Jesus Christ, dude! 
"
7,1,Kyle,"Cartman was visited by aliens again last night. And now it's like we're living a repeat of a previous day.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Oh my God.
"
8,1,Kyle,"God dammit Cartman!
"
15,4,Cartman,"Well what are you guys going to do?! Use a tape measure and measure my penis yourselves?! Are you homos?!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Yeah, none of us wanna marry Butters.
"
2,4,Kenny,"(Hey!)  (Hey, you guys! I'm dy--) 
"
15,9,Butters,"Meheecan, it's your
"
5,11,Randy,"So then, couldn't I just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth?
"
16,7,Cartman,"That's right... That's right!  Ohhh.  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. Please come back. I know I got a little angry but... I believe in you. Do you hear me? I believe in you.
"
3,4,Stan,"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I saw Mel Gibson's movie, The Passion, and Mel Gibson says, in the movie, Jews are the Devil!
"
5,5,Stan,"What's this?
"
16,12,Kyle,"He looks fine.
"
4,13,Cartman,"What are you doing, Kyle?
"
14,9,Kyle,"No.  Couldn't be.  Oh, my God.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih!  Timmih! Lehmeheuh!  Timmih!
"
7,12,Stan,"Shut up, dude. They're a nice family and... Gary is actually really smart and talented.
"
13,6,Randy,"Yes I do, yes I do.
"
16,4,Butters,"You mean it's like, like a monster?
"
6,13,Kyle,"We were almost killed.
"
18,8,Stan,"Dude, girls volleyball isn't a joke. Jokes are hard and require skill.
"
6,9,Cartman,"Yeah, these guys are only motivated by money, Ted.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Cartman! You saved us! 
"
10,13,Butters,"Huh??
"
3,4,Stan,"Yeah.
"
1,7,Cartman,"Hey, he said I could have his pudding! Ask him yourself.  That's right, Principal Victoria. It's okay with me because Eric is cool.
"
17,6,Kyle,"I just... thought it'd be nice.
"
2,7,Stan,"Wow! I guess everything's going to be okay. 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Yeah, I bought all that I could at this bank, and then I got the rest from this guy Ralph in an alley.
"
10,13,Cartman,"Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors.
"
1,7,Cartman,"You're just jealous! Why don't you go back to Endor you stupid wookie?!
"
3,13,Cartman,"Oh, it's soo sweet, you guys.
"
5,11,Cartman,"Alright, alright.
"
5,5,Stan,"Go! Run run run! 
"
13,3,Stan,"So I can return it to a bank?
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Woohoo! Alright!  Oh boy, what a terrific audience. Can I get a wuhwuhwuh what? What?  We're here today to honor those who t-t-tirelessly work so hard to make us laugh. The first comedy award we are presenting is for the funniest kid in school. And the nominees are: 
"
7,7,Stan,"You're gonna be all right.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Hey!)
"
6,4,Cartman,"Wait a minute. They're following us! Full speed, Mr. Worf!
"
1,4,Cartman,"...And so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.
"
6,11,Randy,"What's going on?
"
11,2,Butters,"But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30.
"
3,2,Stan,"...Well, we're gonna go work on getting Kyle's dad a nurection. 
"
3,14,Kyle,"Cartman!!! 
"
10,6,Kyle,"Okay, Mr. Marsh. 
"
8,5,Butters,"Hey, wait a minute.  Why, that's the van that-  Oh my God!
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh, you mean we're gonna die?!
"
13,13,Butters,"Oh jeez!
"
8,9,Stan,"Well hurry up if you're coming, Cartman!
"
5,10,Stan,"Yeah, dude, we'll show you. They're over at Kenny's.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Why don't you make me? 
"
1,8,Cartman,"No Sally Struthers, you gimme that cake!
"
14,4,Stan,"AAH. 
"
5,10,Kyle,"When Cartman first opened the door, and saw the Thompsons, he felt bad for playing a joke on them. Now that everything's turned out alright, he's able to laugh.
"
12,6,Randy,"Jesus... we're all alone... 
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh, that's me!
"
6,6,Butters,"I am Professor Chaos, and now, this puny world uh will bow down to me! 
"
6,9,Stan,"Give the print to us so that we can protect it from Spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it.
"
6,5,Stan,"Dude, put it back, Chef. More commercials might come on soon. 
"
15,13,Kyle,"What? This isn't history.
"
8,5,Cartman,"AWESOM-O understands.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Wow. It's like, it's like, smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and, and you get to take that away from them.  You are so awesome.
"
3,16,Stan,"I just wanted my period.
"
16,10,Randy,"You said we wouldn't be prepared to get rid of him. How did you?
"
16,4,Cartman,"This isn't safe or fun!
"
7,8,Kyle,"You'll never turn ME into a metrosexual! I like being a dirty, filthy little boy!
"
12,11,Stan,"Hey look, there's something here.
"
6,10,Stan,"Cool.  We'll see you later, Bebe.
"
12,12,Stan,"Dude, he's wasted.
"
7,13,Kyle,"Oh God... 
"
9,13,Cartman,"Yes! Yeehehehes! 
"
2,12,Stan,"Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Okay, look: A lot of people claim that on Passover, a blood sucking creature called the Jewpacabra comes out and preys on children. This year passover happens to be the same week as Easter.
"
6,4,Stan,"Don't be so sure. Because I'm gonna tell you: this is gonna get ugly. Real ugly. When all is said and done you could all be looking at being grounded for three, perhaps even four weeks. So if any of you guys want out, just say the word now.
"
6,10,Stan,"Hoh hoh hoh!  Hohohoh hoh!
"
6,15,Stan,"Okay, listen to me. Listen very carefully.  This is a trick that I am doing. Okay? Watch. All I'm gonna do is say a name that I'm gonna pick at random. Okay?  They want me to acknowledge Pete, or Peter.
"
4,9,Randy,"Where is Stan?
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, somethin' is clearly wrong, m'kay, and it would be best to jus' get it out in the open.
"
5,5,Stan,"Oh man, this is another rerun.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Okay, asshole! Give me back my kidney!
"
15,5,Kyle,"Thanks. 
"
4,2,Stan,"We can take the bus to the city. There's super-rich people down there!
"
11,10,Butters,"Praise to the mighty Allah. His divine grace a-and will have brought forth this day.  Oh jeez!  Uhhh, nnow see, your safety is at our whim. This is the price you pay, America! You have defiled Allah, and now we will turn your imagination against you! Death to the Infidels!  Can I go now?  Stan! Kyle! Could you could you get me out of here?? 
"
9,6,Butters,"Oh jeez. I I guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason.
"
11,4,Butters,"Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. 
"
16,3,Stan,"Saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009, you stupid ass wipe.
"
6,13,Randy,"Well, let's all get going.
"
8,1,Butters,"Whoa, I'm getting woozy.
"
8,3,Stan,"Tor- torture you?
"
14,3,Cartman,"IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! 
"
4,4,Kyle,"Gee, you seem a little stressed, Mr. Garrison. Why don't you try some Ritalin? 
"
11,11,Cartman,"Wake up, Kyle. 
"
16,3,Cartman,"Get a couple facing the other way, brah. 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I agree. I mean, it's like  ""come on""! Why do these people who become crippled later in life think they're such great pot-potatuhs?
"
7,10,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
9,8,Randy,"Stan! Get in the car! We have to evacuate!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike no! Stop!
"
9,12,Stan,"So, this is gonna make me happy?
"
1,9,Kenny,"(That is the sickest thing I have ever fucking seen!)
"
7,5,Cartman,"I will
"
17,8,Cartman,"Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hey, this is sweet.
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh.  Oh good. You're a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it's a lady, too. That means we can repopulate the earth. Yippee!
"
6,16,Stan,"I'm me from the past?
"
4,1,Cartman,"I'm sorry, Mom.
"
15,2,Stan,"That's it! Hurry! Gooo! 
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
4,12,Butters,"Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt?  I don't wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.
"
13,14,Stan,"Okay.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Weeeeeee! Oh yes! Oolll! Check it out! Heheyeahehe! 
"
12,3,Kenny,"(What?)  (Where'd she go?) 
"
6,14,Butters,"Sure. 
"
17,6,Kyle,"That's fine. 
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left.  I'm not going to take you back.  You can just go to hell!  You go to hell and you die!  You are a lying bowl of turd, Mr. Hat!  I hope you starve, you lousy son of a bitch!  What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat.
"
18,9,Randy,"Look, I do a lot of post-production enhancements to make my music sound the way it does, okay? I feel like if I play live I'm... really gonna disappoint people. I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
"
2,18,Kyle,"What?! I'm not talking to you! 
"
18,2,Kyle,"No no, he's right! We've gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Haaarrrrrh!)  (Huh?)
"
4,7,Kyle,"Oh. ...Thanks?
"
18,2,Randy,"Oh my God, the WHEAT THINS!
"
14,4,Randy,"That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it. 
"
4,1,Kyle,"Killer.
"
9,11,Kyle,"Cartman! I need to tell you something!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Heh. Huh. Uh-oh.
"
8,8,Kyle,"Stan, don't you think this has gone far enough? Is it really that big a deal?  Yeah, just vote. For Giant Douche.
"
1,4,Cartman,"There he goes.
"
13,14,Butters,"You said ""go ahead"".
"
7,2,Jimmy,"So then, how come you came?
"
4,15,Cartman,"What?!
"
1,1,Kyle,"-bring me back my little brother, God damnit!
"
1,6,Kyle,"What are they doing in there?
"
11,5,Stan,"Where am I supposed to go?
"
12,1,Mr. Mackey,"Kyle, the thing about tattlin' is, eh tattlin's bad. M'kay, because nobody likes a tattle-tale, m'kay?
"
7,11,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
4,17,Kyle,"Just let us stay up a little longer, mom. Mr. Hankey's gotta show up. He always does.
"
2,5,Stan,"Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!
"
8,1,Butters,"I'm a lost soul. A dark lonely shadow of a person-
"
1,1,Kenny,"(Oh nooo!)
"
5,10,Stan,"...Dude, that's not funny if they're missing their son.
"
1,8,Kyle,"Did they say if it's waterproof?
"
15,1,Cartman,"She does! She does it all the time! She fucked me on Christmas, she fucked me on my birthday...
"
2,9,Kyle,"And that's why you got a cold?
"
5,9,Kenny,"(No fuckin' way, dude!)
"
10,3,Cartman,"What?
"
7,6,Stan,"It's a great idea, we just have to keep working at it. 
"
18,5,Stan,"How'd you get that on your phone?
"
12,13,Stan,"I have no idea. 
"
2,15,Cartman,"I can't believe what I'm seeing.
"
13,5,Kyle,"Dude, get out of here! I'm peeing.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Yeah. I guess so.)
"
12,5,Butters,"Are we gonna get tested on this?
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, stop being offensive.
"
18,2,Kyle,"I don't know what we're going to do? It's been like four hours and people still won't talk to us.
"
6,6,Stan,"Okay, so how do we all feel about Towelie as our new friend? 
"
6,1,Stan,"He's right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he'll be able to take the weight off faster.
"
4,1,Stan,"We win again! 
"
10,8,Cartman,"That sonofabitch!
"
4,6,Timmy,"TIMMMIHH, tih, Timmih?
"
12,9,Wendy,"If you're really sorry, you can say it in front of everyone!
"
11,14,Cartman,"Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls.
"
13,4,Butters,"They, uh they aren't gonna show part 2 of the Terrance and Phillip show?
"
6,12,Kyle,"HAAHH!!! 
"
17,5,Cartman,"That sucks, dude.
"
7,13,Stan,"Those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Dude, this is sooo cool! We only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Should be fine.
"
9,10,Stan,"Like I give a crap about what you think, Wendy. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Huh?
"
4,1,Stan,"Nice going, fat boy!
"
4,14,Wendy,"John, come quick! Our little baby's very sick
When I pout she doesn't flinch, and when she doesn't move an inch.
"
1,13,Cartman,"Hey! The white man has marred my people long enough! You keep your God-damned mouth shut!  Stan, I need your bike in order to ride over to the reservation.
"
10,9,Kyle,"Oh no...
"
18,1,Cartman,"You will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing. It is the biggest ""fuck you"" we have ever come up with. But we didn't stop there, because a new company direction also means, of course, a new and improved logo. 
"
14,2,Kyle,"I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
"
16,8,Cartman,"Who needs a coach? We have Butters.
"
15,10,Stan,"Oh I'm ready!
"
3,11,Kyle,"No, we gotta go. Sally Struthers is gonna give us a ride back to Earth.
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, that's not bad.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
4,8,Cartman,"…Touché. But dude, you might as well let me help you. We're in this together. I mean, just… tell me what to do, and I'll do it.  Wendih, let Cartman help. Seriouslih.  Wendih. Seriouslih.  The Bog Monster speaketh.
"
18,9,Kyle,"Dude, I'm telling you. It's crazy. All my little brother wants to do is sit on YouTube watching this PewDiePie play video games. I swear, I don't understand kids these days.
"
2,4,Kyle,"You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!
"
5,13,Stan,"Hey Chef.
"
16,14,Stan,"Hey just one thing, Morgan Freeman:  How come every time something convoluted needs explaining, you show up?
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea.
"
2,4,Kyle,"M'kay?
"
3,12,Stan,"Yes you do! Now, dig! 
"
3,10,Stan,"Yeah, dude. Nobody says ""a-ight"" anymore.
"
16,13,Jimmy,"This is an outrage! Who out there is saying that our friend Stan is a liar?
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles!  Gobbles?!
"
5,1,Cartman,"Yeah. I'm gonna have people over to my house to see it.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Huh, I guess you're right, Butters. All right, come on. 
"
8,8,Kyle,"Well, I just figured you'd vote for my guy! Who's fuckin' friend are you?!  Puffy!
"
2,4,Cartman,"Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!
"
3,9,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
12,13,Stan,"You don't like doing it?
"
12,7,Wendy,"Over here. This looks like an office.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih! Timmih, uh, Jimmih.  Hey Timmy, Timmih Tim-oh! Tim-Timmih!  Timmmih? Jimmih! Jimmih.  Jimmih Timmih Timmih? Timmih, Timmih! Jimmih... Jimmih! Jimmih! Timmih!  Timmih!
"
18,10,Kyle,"Why didn't you tell me, Stam? I would've helped.
"
3,16,Cartman,"Goddammit, Kenny, shut the hell up!
"
2,3,Stan,"What are you talking about, dude?!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Parents? Parents?!  Oh God! 
"
1,10,Kyle,"We have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.
"
10,6,Kenny,"(Yeah, No shit.)
"
4,16,Cartman,"Aw, damnit! Alright.  It is decided.  Butters, your turn. 
"
3,16,Mr. Garrison,"...Well not like that!
"
10,8,Cartman,"Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?
"
7,12,Stan,"Who's Joseph Smith? 
"
16,6,Kyle,"You're in a forest! Go take a crap!
"
18,1,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
14,1,Stan,"Hit A and X together.
"
6,8,Stan,"Dude, look.
"
11,2,Kyle,"Doesn't matter. You're gay now.
"
17,1,Butters,"Wull what's a Jehovah's Witness.
"
9,6,Stan,"Dude, where is she? We can't wait.
"
1,6,Cartman,"Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money.
"
10,1,Stan,"He's back!
"
3,11,Kyle,"You don't remember?!
"
4,2,Stan,"Well, uh-what do you mean?
"
5,13,Kyle,"Alright, Cartman! What's so important you had to pull us away from lighting cow crap on fire?!
"
3,3,Stan,"What the hell is going on?!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Egh!
"
4,2,Stan,"Yeah. We just gotta keep finding teeth and putting them under your pillow. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"One please. 
"
18,6,Stan,"I guess so, but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there?
"
2,14,Cartman,"Ha-ha, you're a wuss. 
"
4,13,Kyle,"Hey! What are you doing?
"
6,5,Stan,"That looks AWEsome! 
"
3,3,Kyle,"He's asleep. Wake up fatass!
"
7,14,Stan,"...Go away.
"
2,4,Stan,"They're gonna chop off his wee wee! 
"
1,1,Kyle,"Come on Eric, we can go play at the bus stop.
"
16,6,Cartman,"Look at his lip.  You've got herpes, dude.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Just stick it on.
"
3,14,Randy,"He took the bell!
"
7,13,Cartman,"The anti-smoking people! They had me say I died from second-hand smoke and... now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real! They'll stop at nothing!!
"
16,9,Kyle,"What? Oh my God.
"
18,2,Cartman,"What, what is it? What is it for?
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh, k-kill me? Uh Jesus Christ!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Trent Boyett?! The kid from preschool?!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Eh!  Goddamnit, stop running into me! 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Well, it's all done. My soul is at peace. I think... I can go now.
"
15,10,Butters,"Look! I think Lemmiwinks killed him! 
"
4,1,Stan,"Come on, who's the second-fattest kid in South Park?
"
16,2,Cartman,"Suck my balls, suck my balls...  Hello!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"It's a- v- validation of all your efforts. An acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves.
"
13,4,Randy,"Oh my God, well how is he doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. Huh okay, well thank you for telling me, Mr. Stotch, I'll spread the word. Yoeah, you take care. Bye.  We need to cancel our plans, Sharon. There's gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight. 
"
3,2,Randy,"Uh. Please, everyone- 
"
8,6,Kyle,"So, dude, do you have any brothers or sisters?
"
9,4,Stan,"It's a game called ""Heaven versus Hell."" Kenny commands the armies of heaven against the forces of Satan.  Dude, you see what Kenny got?
"
7,4,Kyle,"That isn't gonna work, dumbass!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Yeah, but you still shouldn'ta done that. 'E's just a boih.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Hurry up, you guys. We've gotta get that sick kid's tooth fairy money before Loogie does.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Okay, let me have it.
"
7,6,Mr. Garrison,"Oh well, then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties!
"
8,3,Kyle,"Thank you, rabbi.  In 1973, the United States officially issued an apology to the African American community for slavery. In 1956, Germany officially apologized for World War II AND the Holocaust. And now, I believe, in 2004, the Jewish community needs to apologize for the death of Jesus.
"
11,13,Randy,"Hey yeah...
"
6,13,Stan,"Yes, but this is not a--  Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. 
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, let's see, lights.  Mood.  Start counseling timer.  Okay there we go. Okay, we got it.  Okay now, Kyle, you had some concerns about your little brother?
"
13,11,Stan,"I just want people to know that you can stop the Japanese if you have some real goddamned balls
"
4,1,Kyle,"Hey, fatass. How's prison?
"
2,13,Cartman,"I guess, damn!
"
4,12,Stan,"Dude, can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?
"
3,17,Stan,"Dude, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
"
5,10,Cartman,"I think... I.. just.. saw the funniest thing I'll ever see. And I... think... I... blew a funny fuse.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Token?
"
10,1,Stan,"Chef, come on!
"
8,9,Stan,"Goddamn, that took a long time.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Mom. Mom, the Chinese are gonna get me.
"
13,7,Cartman,"I've worked it all out on Expedia.  We can take Southwest Airlines to Miami, then Dubai Air here to Cairo, and then it's just a 49-hour bus ride into Mogadishu, with all the booty and plunder a pirate could want.
"
11,5,Kyle,"Peter Rabbit.
"
18,9,Kenny,"(Commentary?)
"
12,2,Randy,"She's such a train wreck!
"
1,2,Wendy,"Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Thank you. 
"
4,6,Cartman,"Nononono! Me h'myah , you guys myah!  — maybe a little mo down, down in hyah.  SCREW YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"You guys go tell Butters to start making the cutoouts. I'm gonna go tell Mr. Hankey the good news!
"
9,14,Randy,"Stan, you need to learn some things about being a man! Now give me that bottle!  There's a  reason why God made our penises like little hoses, boys. Hold the wheel, Stan.  When you boys start driving, you're gonna need to learn to do this too. Woahp! 
"
4,10,Stan,"Cartman!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Dude, look! There's everyone's backyards!  Dude there's Craig's house! That's Craig's house!
"
9,8,Cartman,"We did!
"
1,5,Stan,"Stan, how would you like to go home and meet your sister?
"
14,6,Stan,"If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!
"
8,11,Cartman,"All right, tell me about it.
"
4,4,Stan,"Yeah, what a dick. Timmy's five times more talented than he is.
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Think hard, Elvis. You're not really the king of rock and roll. You're a fat, stupid, worthless policeman in a small town. Mkay?
"
4,16,Cartman,"Yeah, we'll call the police and say you molestered us, too.
"
6,16,Randy,"Yeah, Stan, don't be so hard on yourself.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Hi, cousin Elvin.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Find the remote! Find the remote! Hold it! 
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"There's nothing left, I told you.
"
18,8,Cartman,"This asshole needs to make a move already!
"
18,9,Kyle,"I don't know what the hell to do. The whole world's gone crazy.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Yeah! Go! 
"
4,9,Kyle,"Run for it! 
"
6,4,Cartman,"We got a real sick kid here, Mike. Did you get the other things for us?
"
11,9,Randy,"Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Wow, dude, Terrance got really fat.
"
11,12,Kyle,"They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Not like that, pony! 
"
18,8,Kenny,"(What?)
"
8,7,Stan,"Who is that?
"
3,9,Kyle,"I'm coming, Ma! 
"
12,10,Cartman,"Oh my god. We're gonna make so much fucking money you guys.
"
13,8,Kenny,"(Son of a stinking bitch!)
"
7,1,Kyle,"Ah, damn it!
"
15,13,Cartman,"Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?
"
2,12,Stan,"My mom won't let us. 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Thanks Polly Prissypants. I'm just so scared that all the kids at school are gonna be talkin' about me behind my back.
"
18,1,Cartman,"You song of a bitch!
"
9,3,Stan,"We can't wait in line! We have to be in school on Monday!
"
2,14,Stan,"No more Chef.
"
11,10,Cartman,"Tell me where the gold is or you die!  Slow! 
"
5,6,Cartman,"Uh yah sir, excuse me. D-Does this mean that I..have...one million dollars?
"
5,6,Stan,"Kyle, I, I understand what you mean, but--
"
11,13,Randy,"Hang on, I almost caught the dragon.
"
3,17,Cartman,"Hey, that's it, Kenny. Maybe Kenny G can show us where 92 cents below the lowest Eb is. Then we'll know the brown noise.
"
7,7,Kyle,"How do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that?
"
2,11,Stan,"It's boring.
"
3,6,Kyle,"Dude! He got a lawyer?
"
1,5,Stan,"A big mutant version of me?
"
3,4,Kyle,"Tweek's gonna fight Craig!
"
18,6,Stan,"...Okay.  Aaaaahhh!
"
6,13,Cartman,"Open.  Bellog. 
"
17,2,Randy,"It's all right. Our kids think they've outsmarted us, but we're the ones who pay the cable company!  What'd they say? Can they remove the parental lock?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Holy shit. Then this is all real. We've all been here from the beginning. Taking turns on the Oculus Rift headset.
"
16,5,Jimmy,"Yeh. Let's go bi- pick on him! Yeh! 
"
14,5,Randy,"Helllo?
"
6,4,Kyle,"Then why the hell do they call it ""veal""??
"
1,7,Stan,"Okay Chef, dial the hotline number. Chef? 
"
10,1,Kyle,"Weirdo. 
"
17,2,Stan,"Okaaay. 
"
8,1,Kyle,"What the hell did you do that for, Kenny?!
"
7,1,Kyle,"What the hell is that?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Butters, do you wanna catch Jewpacabra on camera or not?!  THERE IS NO CHRIST!
"
18,9,Randy,"They made a hologram of me, Sharon! They don't care about the music! They're REPLACING us!
"
7,14,Wendy,"Yeah?
"
10,3,Cartman,"Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Who cares?
"
4,1,Kyle,"We won! We won!
"
4,9,Cartman,"What?
"
10,1,Kyle,"Get outside! 
"
5,13,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, because uh, there's a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could. The stem cells from your fetus could help save his life.
"
13,3,Randy,"That is stupid, yea. And going around telling people to shop... is dangerous!
"
5,3,Stan,"I am ready.
"
6,2,Randy,"No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we're finished, okay.
"
17,7,Jimmy,"You know that the PS4 is a better choice. I mean, come on.
"
11,10,Kyle,"A-ah! A-a-ah! Wha? Where...? Oh. Oh dude. Oh, it was just a dream. It was all just a crazy dream. Huh, oh my God. 
"
6,1,Cartman,"I can't lose weight, Butters, 'cause I'm not fat. I'm big-boned. You can't slim down bones, stupid!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh. Uh, lessee.  I only got six dollars and twelve cents.
"
7,14,Stan,"He's right. I don't even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it. Screw you guys, I'm goin' home. 
"
4,2,Butters,"What the-?  Who's there? Who is that?!
"
10,6,Kyle,"Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Come on in.
"
1,10,Kyle,"Hey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.
"
1,7,Kyle,"Dude, I thought she was dead.
"
6,5,Stan,"We have to go to Butters' or Cartman's house! We have nowhere else to go!
"
13,11,Stan,"Dude, it wasn't actually and dolfin and a whale who bombe Hiroshima. It was the-
"
2,17,Kyle,"My butt hurts.
"
6,9,Cartman,"It's not hard, it's just a stupid little paper hat. People just need free stuff - don't you guys know anything?!
"
13,8,Kyle,"I just... don't understand it.
"
6,2,Stan,"No, I never have.
"
12,8,Stan,"COME ON LET'S GO! 
"
14,3,Randy,"I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
5,10,Cartman,"I'm sorry Ms. Choksondik.
"
13,6,Randy,"You see Stan? What did Daddy tell you? Everything worked out.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Hokay, thanks, Dr. Mephesto! 
"
7,12,Stan,"That's not what the Harrisons said.
"
9,1,Kyle,"Alright, Dad! 
"
11,14,Wendy,"All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy.
"
18,7,Butters,"Kyle, it's Butters. I've been grounded!
"
8,6,Cartman,"Not go to Mr. Jefferson's anymore? Well, excuse my French, Mrs. Marsh, but you can suck my fat, hairy balls! 
"
2,12,Stan,"This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
"
18,3,Butters,"That's Cartman's new transgender bathroom.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Thanks for seeing us, sir. My friend is really worried about his dad.
"
14,7,Jimmy,"She's sure to make you g-giggle.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Kenny cast Glacial Crasher, and then Stan's dad shot his dick off. I just, I seriously don't know where we go from here. You all right, Kenny?
"
5,13,Cartman,"There's a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now, doctor. I'm gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves.
"
4,10,Cartman,"What?
"
13,13,Cartman,"Huh!
"
5,5,Stan,"Yeah, he looks terrible.
"
16,6,Cartman,"No- cold sore is what girls call it, Kenny. It's actually herpes.
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey Mom, door bell's ringin'.
"
10,8,Randy,"Damnit, mine's in the shop!  Uh hey! Eh help! Stop!  Please, it's an emergency!  Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!
"
5,6,Stan,"Look, Kyle, Cartman is totally miserable.  Even more miserable than he was before because he's had his dream and lost it.
"
1,5,Kyle,"Why's your sister so mean to you dude?
"
6,4,Stan,"Butters!  Did you bring it?
"
3,4,Cartman,"What do you mean, what do you do? You just fight each other.
"
8,1,Kyle,"You don't know anything about Jews, fatass!
"
1,1,Cartman,"I don't wanna.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Oh Jesus, he's gonna kill us. We-we've gotta tell our parents!
"
4,13,Kyle,"Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! 
"
4,3,Randy,"...Ew!
"
4,2,Cartman,"...Tits.
"
1,13,Stan,"Come on Grampa. We wanna watch Terrance and Phillip.
"
15,12,Kenny,"(I don't really know!)
"
18,7,Kyle,"Wait. Stan?  Hold on, is this my virtual reality, or Cartman's virtual reality?
"
12,10,Stan,"Ya see, Craig? 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Just give it a little kiss and I'll help.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Yeah. Everything is fine.)
"
4,2,Kyle,"Wahahahah!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Shut up, Butters.  Now, there's a way out of this. We just have to use our... ninja reasoning. 
"
6,3,Butters,"Cool!
"
17,6,Cartman,"You're gonna... come with me... to Israel, Kyle? 
"
4,6,Stan,"Aah! There's more of them! Quick, hide! 
"
15,12,Kyle,"How do you murder a stuffed animal?!
"
1,2,Wendy,"It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Ah, damn it! My little brother's trying to follow me to school again.
"
4,10,Stan,"You're a sinner!
"
1,4,Stan,"D'you have lots of gay dogs here?
"
2,3,Cartman,"Sir, step out of the car.
"
1,12,Stan,"Ow, that sucks, dude!
"
4,4,Randy,"Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can't pay attention in school without it.
"
2,10,Stan,"Ow! 
"
14,14,Randy,"Bohh-riiing.
"
1,5,Cartman,"I ain't helpin' crap!  I want to eat some paeh.
"
9,11,Cartman,"-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille 
Four hungry children and a-
"
7,4,Kyle,"God damnit!
"
4,13,Stan,"Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!
"
11,5,Kyle,"Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus.
"
10,13,Cartman,"There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!
"
16,7,Kyle,"It's perfect! I could take her to a basketball game.  Man I I don't know what's happenin', but... it seems like all the girls are... kind of into me lately. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"You know this guy?
"
4,4,Mr. Mackey,"It should be easy enough to find out. They have tests for that kind of thing now, m'kay?
"
16,5,Stan,"That's the third day in a row. You gotta tell the teacher.
"
7,3,Butters,"Yep. I'm in jail.
"
10,6,Cartman,"I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad.
"
8,14,Stan,"It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!
"
7,6,Kyle,"Certainly.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"OH, GOD-DAMNIT! You'd better be kidding! 
"
6,7,Butters,"You know that big statue in the town square of pioneer John Wesley Powell? I snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh, and I cut off his head!  Hahahahaa, yeah!
"
4,6,Kyle,"Well, Cartman
"
4,10,Cartman,"Jesus was made of crackers?
"
14,8,Butters,"Eric, are you sure you can do this?
"
1,3,Kyle,"What?!
"
9,5,Kyle,"Dude, thanks for helping us out by joining our team.
"
4,2,Kenny,"(Nuh-uh.)
"
12,7,Stan,"Well why don't you go get them and bring them back here?!
"
1,3,Cartman,"Oh yeah? Have you guys ever heard of  Scuzzlebutt?
"
2,18,Kyle,"Fine! 
"
10,10,Kyle,"Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman.
"
5,3,Stan,"Yeah.
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"I'm sorry, toots.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Okay.
"
9,5,Cartman,"All right, hit one out of the park!
"
2,3,Kenny,"(Oh, it was only my jacket.)
"
9,5,Cartman,"Exactly right, Clyde. So what we need... is to find somebody to join our team, who totally sucks ass.
"
1,4,Stan,"Mph. 
"
12,6,Randy,"Forty seconds? That ain't even long enough to check Wikipedia!
"
16,4,Cartman,"It's like a Sasquatch, only more elusive, more ferocious and a little more greedy.
"
8,10,Stan,"Sshhh, here comes Ms. Claridge now. 
"
14,5,Cartman,"Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?
"
7,11,Kyle,"I'm not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
"
1,4,Stan,"Get down Sparky! Down!
"
15,8,Kyle,"You made hamburgers? Well that's awesome! I'd love one.  Mmm. Hm, wow  This is really good, Cartman.
"
3,11,Stan,"What??
"
4,6,Stan,"Yeah.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Just let me get my cowboy hat.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!
"
2,12,Kyle,"Fine!
"
18,8,Cartman,"Did you hear that? He's shuffling his deck already. The only thing he's got on the battle ground now is an overseer.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Twenty minutes! Does Tim Rice's mom give him twenty minutes to write the lyrics to ""Phantom Of The Opera""?!  Speak to me Helen. Let me be your voice.  Come on, you blind bitch! Channel your spirit through me!
"
14,14,Randy,"See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo.
"
2,7,Kyle,"You can say that again.
"
8,6,Kyle,"That poor kid.
"
5,4,Kyle,"What's in it for us?
"
5,10,Cartman,"...You guys!... 
"
16,5,Butters,"Uh stop... Stop trying to make me say things I don't want to on your TV show.
"
15,11,Randy,"Oh man! It was great! A different Broadway show every night! I'm telling you guys, New York is the place to be!
"
9,11,Stan,"Huh? Why?
"
10,7,Cartman,"Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...
"
10,9,Kyle,"Really?
"
7,1,Kyle,"Why do you put them into people's asses? Are you planning some kind of alien takeover?
"
14,4,Stan,"Eh hey, could you tell me how I-
"
15,10,Cartman,"You said Pete Melman couldn't kill himself! By making Jenny Simon crap her pants worse than Pete, I've made her the number one story on Eavesdropper! 
"
2,12,Cartman,"And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding.
"
18,6,Randy,"You need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way, okay?!
"
7,14,Butters,"Uh but I spent it all.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"He never did, Mom! And I think you knew he never did!
"
4,7,Kenny,"(You never seem to care when I die!)
"
9,11,Cartman,"Hey Clyde, Token. Sup, Jim? 
"
7,9,Kyle,"Yeah, it's tough. But it's times like these that... you see what your band is made of. We've gotta fight through the rough times like Journey!
"
3,16,Stan,"Look, it doesn't matter who it is. The point is that everyone else got their period and this person hasn't.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Yes, Mr. Garrison, I have to go now.
"
12,12,Randy,"O-bama you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind. Hey Obama! Hey Obama! 
"
1,11,Cartman,"No way!
"
2,8,Cartman,"Well, you heard wrong, hippie!
"
11,8,Cartman,"All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?
"
13,7,Cartman,"That's Captain Cartman, you Jewswoggle!
"
10,7,Cartman,"Ah! Quit it!
"
14,6,Cartman,"That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!
"
8,3,Stan,"Goddamn, that guy's crazy.  Hey dude, you've gotta speed up.
"
1,5,Stan,"Crap.
"
14,5,Stan,"No, dude, it was totally fine.
"
6,6,Kyle,"Towelie.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Fuck you! No I don't!
"
10,1,Kyle,"Chef, the police are asking questions about you!
"
16,6,Kyle,"Oh, thank God!
"
6,17,Kyle,"Me neither.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"I/m sorry about this, Ms. Gomez.  Alright, get her the fuck out of here. 
"
9,2,Cartman,"I knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival! All right, everyone pack up your crap, we're going to our basement!
"
11,14,Stan,"Here, Kyle.  We've been through a lot, but, you can finally see where you really are on the list. 
"
5,9,Cartman,"What is this? The freakin' Flintstones?
"
12,3,Kyle,"Kenny! 
"
14,10,Stan,"Who are you people?
"
4,14,Cartman,"Terrible!  I can't write the lyrics for the third act! Nothing's coming to me.
"
11,12,Butters,"I c-I can?
"
6,5,Cartman,"And my house is being fumigated!
"
8,6,Stan,"Stop, you fucking lunatic! 
"
10,4,Kyle,"Excuse me.  Do you know which way the network president's office is?
"
4,7,Cartman,"No, mine. M'yah!  Ha haa ha! I broke your space cruiser, Kenny! Ha haa, ha ha ha  bluh oh, ha-ow! 
"
3,4,Kyle,"No I won't, because you'd eat 'em first, tubby. 
"
16,4,Cartman,"I love you, dad.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Butters.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Uuh, that's, that's fine. I know how to get us out.
"
14,7,Kyle,"This is serious, you fucking asshole!
"
1,6,Stan,"Okay grampa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest.  You got the cow all tied up?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Stan's Uncle Jimbo! He has a bomb shelter in his backyard! Come on, Butters! Hurry! 
"
4,4,Stan,"Because we're on Ritalin.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Well, are you sure you have to leave so early?
"
7,14,Kyle,"'K.  She says she's been wantin' to break up for a while, and it's nothing against you.
"
11,7,Kyle,"Oh my God.
"
4,17,Kyle,"God job, Butters.
"
3,13,Stan,"What's that?
"
1,9,Kyle,"There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
"
11,14,Cartman,"Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!
"
4,8,Kyle,"Not really.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Butters. Butters, come here for a sec.
"
9,13,Stan,"It's true. The whale talked to all of us. In between shows at his orca tank.
"
7,11,Cartman,"We're here! We're here! Casa Bonita!  Aw man, this is gonna be so great!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters, we live in a world where privacy is gone. Okay? It's... It' just gone, bud. Your wiener, my balls, they're public domain. You can get on the Internet right now and look at that chick from Hunger Games' butthole. We can either all freak out about it, or we can just calm down because honestly, I'm getting a little sick of covering your ass!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Me? You're the one talking about killer titties.  Watch out, guys. Wendy said boobs can kill people.  Grrr. Gonna get you. Gonna get you, Wendy!
"
10,9,Cartman,"Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!
"
15,2,Kyle,"Ahhh I've seen this before. Whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies, they tell it some kind of paradox, to get its processors all tripped out.
"
15,1,Butters,"""Apple and its subsidiaries may also, if necessary, sew yet another person's mouth onto your butthole, making you a being that shares one gastral tract."" Hmmm, I'm gonna click onnn... ""Decline.""
"
8,14,Kyle,"Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!
"
3,5,Kyle,"You don't like anything, Cartman! 
"
4,17,Cartman,"Yeah, this thing really falls apart in the second act.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!
"
9,5,Stan,"We can start having fun again! 
"
12,2,Randy,"We haven't told you about it, Stanley, because we, we like to wait until kids are a little older to talk to them about things like condoms and ritualistic human sacrifice for harvest.
"
3,8,Stan,"Dude, I'm not putting on ladies' clothes, and I'm not playing Charlie's Angels! You guys are Melvins, and I'm not one of you! So you go ahead and be Melvins, and leave me alone!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here.
"
2,15,Cartman,"What do you mean, what am I doing?! Im just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys.
"
9,2,Cartman,"It's too late! Even if I did agree to help, there's too many of them now!
"
2,10,Kyle,"But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Now, Token, what you need to understand, m'kay, is that a school assembly is not the time and the place to be yellin' and causin' distractions. M'kay? If there's somebody causin' you problems, then we don't disrupt the assembly, m'kay. You come and you talk to me.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Cartman, don't!
"
2,2,Cartman,"Goddammit! Who's my father?
"
1,8,Stan,"He can do really cool stuff with his voice. Show 'em Starvin' Marvin. 
"
10,7,Cartman,"All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now.
"
13,3,Stan,"Nnnaaargh!
"
1,11,Stan,"No.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Uhhh... I'm not sure.
"
10,2,Cartman,"You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"How do you live with yourself? You know you had nothing to do with the fishsticks joke.  But you just keep pretending. How do you look at yourself in the f-f-fucking mirror?! That's what I want to know!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy.
"
11,4,Cartman,"What?
"
5,4,Cartman,"You wanna see 'em?
"
16,12,Butters,"That sure is a great Gangnam Style costume, Craig. I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that has been bitten by a werewolf.  Oh wow! Nice costume, Stan. It's Gangnamstein!
"
12,11,Randy,"Oh no, I'm way too startled!
"
16,1,Stan,"Yeah.
"
7,9,Kyle,"Go ahead! People will just download your songs for free on the Internet anyways!
"
15,4,Kyle,"That doesn't make any sense.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Let me try, let me try. We are from America. A-me-ri-ca.  We are lost and verry hungry. Necesito burri-tos. 
"
6,7,Butters,"Haaa!
"
11,2,Butters,"So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?
"
13,10,Stan,"He's here, Ohh my God  Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-
"
12,2,Cartman,"Sweet!
"
6,14,Randy,"Oh my God.
"
1,11,Cartman,"Wow, she's pretty.
"
2,9,Stan,"Okay! 
"
3,1,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, we have a special guest today, a woman recruiting young people  for a national choir tour. Now I know that choir tours are totally stupid and lame , but please, give her your full attention.  Go ahead.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Yesterday, as most of you know, I walked out on this program, and on our school. I was so... fed up with our president's hypocrisies, me not being able to sell my book. I wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld. And so I decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the Smurfs.  I simply observed the gentle Smurfs at first. I wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives. They were wary of me in the beginning, but slowly I began to earn their trust.  It wasn't long before the gentle Smurfs accepted me as one of their own. 
"
17,9,Cartman,"The last two weeks we've been too busy to play video games and, look at what we did. There's been drama, action, romance... I mean honestly you guys, do we need video games to play?
"
15,6,Butters,"Oh hey Dad.
"
4,9,Randy,"And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about.
"
11,1,Stan,"Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Sir Stan, I was hoping I could talk to you about the wedding.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?
"
9,3,Cartman,"This will only take a second.
"
13,10,Stan,"Don't go pointing fingers at me, partner! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... 
"
7,10,Stan,"Oh, stop it, Dad! This is partly your fault!
"
12,1,Kyle,"You better! 'Cause if you don't find a cure for HIV, I will break your Xbox!
"
12,14,Butters,"Soda and Cheetos, yes. I'll be right back.
"
2,14,Stan,"So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
"
4,13,Cartman,"Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. 
"
16,11,Kenny,"My dearest friends.
I am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of Kava'i. What can I tell you of this mysterious island and its people? It is a place of wonder, and yet to the outsider like me, a place of odd tradition. The people here are peaceful and joyous, and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world. Their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vodka, which they call the chi-chi. As for Butters, he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors, and seems to be feeling better with every passing day. He still seems quite angry at times, but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow.
"
14,2,Cartman,"They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! 
"
13,10,Kenny,"(They're gonna hurt our chances.)
"
11,5,Stan,"They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want!  They're coming in! Dad, open the door!  Dad?
"
2,5,Stan,"Wa-was it wearing clothes?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?
"
16,14,Kyle,"It doesn't matter if I am or not. People voted and I stand behind the president.
"
6,13,Cartman,"This... is so cool.
"
15,4,Butters,"Whoa, it's a little chilly in here.
"
1,4,Stan,"I guess.
"
13,4,Butters,"Oh boy!
"
13,12,Stan,"""Bike-curious""! Don't you people keep up with today's lingo at all?!
"
11,13,Kyle,"I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. 
"
2,4,Cartman,"No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!
"
2,12,Stan,"...What?!
"
4,6,Cartman,"It's ""Investigative Reports with Bill Kurtis"" funtime game. You have to decide if you deny it or cover it up.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Can we go now, please?!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
"
1,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well, you don't see that everyday.
"
4,7,Cartman,"whatwhatwhatwhat?  Oh, it's Stan and Butters! Trying to take my kidney, are you?!
"
6,1,Stan,"What kind of help?
"
8,13,Cartman,"More people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts, huh? Ahhh, it's so very tiring.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Uh.
"
5,9,Stan,"Alright alright, let's just get the goat back to his home!  We have to find this address. 
"
11,8,Butters,"Wuh who are you talking about?
"
4,13,Cartman,"Well...  ""Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!""
"
9,2,Randy,"Vehicle shell holding! 
"
2,5,Kyle,"...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled.
"
13,13,Wendy,"Okay.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Uh where should I sit? There's no place to sit down here.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Really?
"
6,4,Randy,"Vaginitis?
"
8,9,Cartman,"...You see, Kyle, it was me who slashed the bu-
"
7,13,Cartman,"Handle it? For two billion dollars I'd handle my grandpa's balls, sir.
"
1,12,Cartman,"Aaah! Aliens! 
"
2,13,Kenny,"(Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)
"
11,13,Randy,"You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl
Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy
You're my girl, you're my girl
"
1,7,Wendy,"AAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Kyle! Get out of my flashback, you God-damned Jew!
"
7,8,Cartman,"Guys, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Look, guys, a lot of the kids in school are talking, okay? And they're spreading rumors that we're not metrosexuals because... we hang out with Kyle.
"
3,14,Stan,"Now, the first thing I want you to do for us is-
"
8,9,Randy,"It's simple economics, son. I don't understand it at all, but, God I love it.
"
7,12,Cartman,"Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.
"
14,7,Butters,"The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked.  And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth.  Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Who you calling stupid, Jew?
"
15,10,Stan,"The-hay've got a video of Pete Melman's mom showing up with fresh underwear on Eavesdropper!
"
14,6,Stan,"Yeah.
"
3,4,Cartman,"I don't Craig, I don't know. But now he's over there telling everybody that you're a poop-eater and he chooses you.
"
4,16,Kyle,"How?!
"
9,3,Stan,"Oh no, no no no, come on!  Excuse me, ma'am.
"
14,4,Wendy,"That's what Susan92 wrote on your wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you! 
"
15,7,Cartman,"Stan, knock it off!
"
11,11,Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAAAA- 
"
6,6,Cartman,"Well, in the, in the months since our friend Kenny died, you've really stepped up as a friend and ""filled the gap."" 
"
11,8,Cartman,"I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Just bring out Elton John already!
"
8,1,Kenny,"(unintelligible)
"
2,16,Cartman,"Ugh! Wait! You guys. Seriously. 
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah. You know, I can't believe in Jesus anymore, 'cause he's a damned fraud, so what I'm gonna believe in is just bein' me, and bein' independent like you. So what I did is I got this brown bracelet to remind me of standing my ground, uhkay? And just believin' in the cause of bein' me.
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"Ohh, uh, gee, isn't that an amazing coincidence?  Hmm, what are the odds of that?
"
10,8,Randy,"Where?!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Aha! I knew it was a turd trick, and I opened the door because Mr. Kitty is on his way right now to my mom's party with the picture!
"
18,10,Stan,"Yeah.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Sorry, able-bodied, you can't join.
"
3,4,Stan,"Well, uh. We just came by because we have something to tell you.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Well Eric, you need to do somethin' because you keep losing sleep. M'kay and sleep is very important to your success at school. M'kay?
"
4,11,Cartman,"And perhaps worst of all, in hell, there are dozens and dozens of little trinket stores! But they all have the same little trinkets in them-eh!
"
9,11,Cartman,"... Huh?
"
16,9,Kyle,"I'm sorry Token, I had to tell him. His life is in danger.
"
11,2,Butters,"...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
"
18,3,Stan,"What?
"
14,1,Butters,"But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
"
6,7,Stan,"Tweek, when has that ever happened, except for that one time?
"
6,10,Stan,"Don't you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.
"
11,2,Cartman,"This picture I like to call ""The Pierre"". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha.  And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth.  I call this picture ""The Sleeping Menstrual"".  This one, I call ""Hot Fudge Mondae"".  I really like how the light plays with the background on this one.
"
2,3,Kyle,"It looks like a note.
"
13,10,Butters,"Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Did you hear about Pete Melman? Pretty messed up, huh?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Oh my gohhhd, so cute! 
"
15,13,Cartman,"Yeah, History Channel rules.
"
8,1,Stan,"What is it, Craig?
"
9,5,Randy,"Because I'm scared, all right?!  You wanna break me down?! You wanna hear me say it?! I'm scared! I don't know if I believe in myself anymore.  I don't know if I can take this guy, Sharon.
"
5,7,Stan,"We just didn't want the girls giving us diseases.
"
7,13,Kyle,"No we didn't, dude! No we didn't! 
"
8,3,Kyle,"One please.
"
4,1,Kyle,"So now what do we do?
"
16,2,Stan,"No i wouldn't.
"
17,10,Jimmy,"Yeah. I wouldn't mind t-tah-t-tappin' that ass.
"
1,5,Kyle,"It's more than you've got!
"
11,13,Stan,"Wow, this is a huge party.
"
2,6,Cartman,"It's a Sri Lanka frog!
"
13,3,Mr. Garrison,"Oh Jesus, I'm sorry. Please.
"
8,1,Stan,"Aw dude, crap. All our parents are there.
"
17,8,Cartman,"That doesn't even make sense.
"
8,14,Cartman,"Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends.
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah. America is sooo much cooler. In Romania they just oppress you and try to bring you down.
"
3,2,Kyle,"No, that's a hair dryer!
"
2,8,Stan,"What the hell is going on? 
"
2,7,Kyle,"Calm down, dude. You're upsetting Kenny.
"
11,12,Cartman,"No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real.
"
2,12,Stan,"Pretty good. We're almost done.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Yes, hello. I have a living thing inside of me that needs to be sucked out, please.
"
15,10,Butters,"It's megasuperhilarious! 
"
13,4,Randy,"Alright son! Yeah!!
"
2,8,Stan,"How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
"
1,11,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman!
"
8,2,Cartman,"It's flawless! I'll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I'll kick ass against all the handicaps!
"
1,1,Stan,"Oh my God! They've killed Kenny!
"
18,7,Cartman,"I'm not lying. Go ahead and ask Customer Service.
"
9,5,Randy,"Oh my God.
"
1,9,Kyle,"I told you not to call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
"
14,6,Stan,"Oh dude, look.  Hey, Cartman...
"
11,10,Butters,"Fellas! Fellas wait!  Hold on, fellas!
"
1,10,Cartman,"You guys, my mom is getting a Ferris wheel.
"
17,2,Kyle,"What? How do you know?
"
14,9,Cartman,"Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights!  Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! 
"
6,10,Wendy,"What are you doing?!
"
12,12,Kyle,"Ike?  Oh crap Ike?
"
3,8,Butters,"How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?
"
16,13,Stan,"No thanks. I'll stand.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Stan? 
"
1,4,Kyle,"Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it's not that bad.
"
6,2,Kyle,"I can't lose another friend. First Kenny and now Stan? All I'm gonna have left are you two douches. 
"
2,13,Kenny,"(What? These?)
"
12,8,Cartman,"...No no, it's okay. We are Chinese peopull.
"
2,4,Cartman,"Fireman!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Butters?
"
8,12,Cartman,"Oh wait, wait, wait, aah it wasn't her. That's right, I forgot, it was uh... Kelly Pinkertonstinfurter
"
4,13,Cartman,"Whoa...
"
4,8,Wendy,"I can't believe it. All the pressure's on us. I mean, this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote.
"
15,1,Kyle,"Dad, if you agree to something but you didn't mean to agree to it, what do you do?!
"
5,13,Mr. Garrison,"And so, we will all miss Kenny, his playful laughter, his innocent smile. But we will never forget that it was because of brave Kenny that stem-cell research was allowed to continue.
"
1,6,Kenny,"(Oh my God!)  (Owww!) 
"
5,4,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus!
"
10,6,Kyle,"Ruuun! 
"
4,6,Cartman,"Yeah! 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me fat, Token!
"
10,10,Cartman,"That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. 
"
9,6,Butters,"Ih ih it wasn't me! Ih it was the ghost!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home.
"
14,5,Randy,"Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!
"
15,11,Randy,"Oh. Wicked.
"
18,5,Cartman,"But you didn't say anything?! That's fucking spying, Kyle!
"
18,2,Stan,"Yeah. Dad, you know that guy at work you said is Lorde's uncle or something?
"
8,8,Randy,"Stan!
"
16,3,Butters,"We got it. We got it!
"
3,12,Stan,"Dude, she's perfect. She only died, like, three months ago, right?
"
14,1,Butters,"Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
"
14,4,Stan,"I don't know you!
"
4,15,Cartman,"Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.
"
6,2,Cartman,"Oh, really? ...Oh well, heh, heheheheh, heh
"
7,3,Kyle,"A boat ride?
"
5,5,Kyle,"Wait! dude, LOOK! 
"
1,12,Stan,"Why do you wanta know, lady?!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Yeah, I'll see you around.  Sure is too bad about my grandma, though...
"
18,3,Stan,"The chick that wrote the theme song to the new Hunger Games, is you?
"
10,13,Cartman,"I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!
"
10,7,Cartman,"That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
"
7,12,Stan,"I don't?
"
1,1,Kyle,"Ike, jump down, now! For the love of God, Ike, jump!
"
13,5,Mr. Mackey,"Fishsticks? Yeah, I l- I like fishsticks, m'kay?
"
18,10,Stan,"We're not old people! You guys are just into lame, vulgar crap, and it needs to be stopped!
"
3,5,Stan,"I saw it this way!
"
10,4,Cartman,"Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!
"
7,9,Kyle,"Ugh. Can't you see this is my dream?? Music is my life!
"
5,1,Stan,"Now what are we gonna do, Chef?
"
6,15,Stan,"No it isn't! When a father dies, inheritance is usually an issue, and money is something everyone worries about.
"
14,9,Kyle,"Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel.
"
1,13,Stan,"Yeah. We'd better get this videotape over to Mr. Mackey, quick!
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, there we go. That's cut the speakers off. Now what was it you were trying to do, Kyle?
"
4,17,Kyle,"You sit- 
"
10,13,Cartman,"Tell me about it.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Wendy, could I talk to you for a second?
"
12,3,Stan,"What the hell is he talking about?
"
7,12,Cartman,"Go kick his ass, Stan.
"
17,8,Kyle,"If you want to make sure I'm not switching sides, Cartman, you don't have to worry. Stan is wrong.
"
13,12,Cartman,"That was us!
"
13,12,Kyle,"Yeah! We did it, you guys! 
"
2,5,Mr. Mackey,"Could I get some more pork?
"
8,2,Cartman,"Well, Kyle, I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate you being so direct. Um, the thing is, you really have kind a warped view on morality because you're Jewish. Now, Kyle, you haven't gone to see Mel Gibson's film, The Passion but-
"
7,15,Kyle,"Who's that?
"
8,1,Kyle,"We've gotta hurry, it's getting late! 
"
13,12,Stan,"Aw crap! 
"
6,12,Kyle,"Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn't a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Hell no! 
"
18,2,Kyle,"Who took all the pizza and the cake?  What the hell?
"
2,2,Kyle,"I'm sailing ay...
"
5,14,Butters,"A drive? Oh, boy!  I- I love a good drive. Is Dad comin' too?
"
12,1,Cartman,"Well he was being a total dick! And he's a big tattle-tale and going around and talking crap about me!
"
11,7,Cartman,"Yes! That's three homeless! Suck on that! Fuck yeah! 
"
1,9,Kyle,"Oh no, I'm not sane yet!
"
7,7,Stan,"We need something that'll get us money tomorrow!
"
18,1,Kyle,"I'm just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to.
"
7,9,Kyle,"""We cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony, which will be held tomorrow morning at ten. Details and proof of sales enclosed. P.S. Nananana na na. Hahahaha ha ha.""  He did it. Cartman got a platinum album.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Dude... What?
"
17,7,Kyle,"No, the XBox's are gonna be better.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Starvin' Marvin!
"
7,4,Stan,"I gues we're just gonna have to do it with the three of us! Come on, guys!
"
14,8,Cartman,"I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men.
"
4,16,Stan,"Dude!  You're not gonna believe what Cartman has!
"
5,9,Stan,"No, we're not gonna kill it, Cartman! We'll just have to  take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan. Come on, goat. 
"
17,7,Stan,"We come seeking your help. Do you side with those wanting XBoxe's, or will you join us on Black Friday and fight for PS4s?
"
17,7,Cartman,"Lady McCormick, I was hoping I could talk to you about Kyle.
"
2,14,Stan,"'Kay.
"
5,13,Butters,"Oh. Well, uh okay. 
"
7,4,Stan,"Let's go see a movie! 
"
9,8,Cartman,"Well here.  Roy keeps the keys in the glove box.
"
8,4,Stan,"Huh?
"
2,15,Kyle,"There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. 
"
15,8,Stan,"Come on, Kyle. This is about you and me, remember?!
"
15,1,Kyle,"(I can't take it! I want out right now!)
"
3,10,Randy,"What are you doing?
"
5,12,Butters,"Heh yeah, later, puss.
"
12,7,Wendy,"Oh crap, we've gotta hide. Come on! 
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh thanks! 
"
5,8,Stan,"Come on, guys. Let's go play video games!
"
12,2,Stan,"Ms. Spears, uh... we're... really... sorry for making you want to kill yourself.
"
10,12,Butters,"He told me to!
"
3,11,Kyle,"Thanks.
"
18,9,Cartman,"He plays video games and makes millions of dollars, and it's lame how?
"
7,15,Stan,"Do something, Kyle! 
"
9,6,Cartman,"No! No!!
"
16,6,Kyle,"Just go. Go without me.
"
10,6,Kyle,"Dude, get away from me!
"
18,8,Stan,"Uhhh, Mitchell sent us?
"
11,5,Randy,"Come on, we've gotta go!  Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Right.
"
1,1,Cartman,"Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
"
12,1,Kyle,"Oh please, no reason! I got AIDS from him!
"
16,8,Butters,"Boy, I just don't get football. Guess that's why I suck at it.
"
11,7,Randy,"SIT... doowwwnnnn!
"
7,11,Butters,"It is! It is getting closer! Oh my God!
"
7,3,Kyle,"What's this all about, Cartman?
"
7,1,Kyle,"That does it! CHARGE! 
"
6,10,Cartman,"Yeah, may be.
"
3,4,Stan,"Come on, Tweek! You got him!
"
6,3,Butters,"Uhhh all right, then. See you guys tomorrow. 
"
9,14,Randy,"But the statue wasn't a miracle!
"
14,14,Randy,"Jamie Oliver!
"
4,8,Stan,"Islam??
"
10,7,Cartman,"No thanks, I'd rather naught.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Oh, hello, excuse me, but Craig is the biggest troublemaker in our class.
"
17,2,Wendy,"Unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from Syria should be considered in need-
"
3,11,Cartman,"Wah-ey. Come on you guys, wait!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Cool! Now let's try the script!
"
1,1,Wendy,"But why, Stan?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Mom! Seriously! Let's go to the toy store, Mom. Now! Must go! Toy store!
"
7,7,Cartman,"That's right!
"
15,7,Stan,"Awww God! 
"
17,1,Butters,"Well, we believe that he means the government loves you, and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart.
"
5,5,Stan,"Ee yeah, you must have a lot of catching up to do. But let's rehearse first.
"
1,6,Stan,"'Kay, come on guys. 
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"And what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior, young man! M'kay?
"
12,3,Kyle,"What are you doing with cats in your attic, fatass?!
"
13,11,Stan,"Yeah. Butters, do you wanna help?
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Uh-huh) 
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, hey, yay!) 
"
1,10,Mr. Garrison,"I'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today.
"
10,8,Kyle,"I'm out of mana, I told you.
"
11,13,Kyle,"No. You're thinking of somebody else.
"
9,6,Butters,"Aww, that's okay, Eric.
"
13,14,Kyle,"...What?!
"
18,6,Randy,"Do you know what you've done to your grandson? You've infected him with your bullshit!
"
11,8,Cartman,"That's right, Kyle.  Crap-filled vagina!
"
4,2,Cartman,"No, man, that's just a TV show.
"
18,3,Cartman,"At this school, it doesn't matter if you're trans or you're cis, right guys?!  What we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant! You know what we call those? Cissies!
"
17,7,Kyle,"If some of us are on PS4s, but the rest of us are on XBox's, then we all can't play together online. See? This is all about committing to one machine.
"
3,8,Randy,"You mean it? I'm not gay?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Aww coool, huh Kenny? Peew Peew! I got a NASCAR, Kenny!  So awesome, huh Kenny? 
"
15,9,Butters,"Ma'am, can I, can I just use your phone?
"
12,8,Stan,"Kyle.  Kyle, you can't keep doing this. You know what, at some point, you you've got to let this go.
"
16,13,Butters,"Hey Stan, well, some people are sayin' that you knew what you were doing all along. That, that you, you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the Belarusian farmers.
"
12,5,Mr. Garrison,"Thanks everyone. It's great to be back. I'm a man again. Thanks to my very special new friend.  But you know, I've learned that I've really been a dude all along. Because the key difference between men and women is that women can have babies. If you can't have babies, then, you're a man.
"
16,3,Cartman,"You pull down your pants and wipe your butt on the ground like an old dog. 
"
1,3,Stan,"Ah, damn it, I can't do it!
"
5,13,Kenny,"(That's awesome) 
"
15,11,Stan,"No. Dad. Please don't do this!
"
11,14,Butters,"Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!
"
17,7,Kenny,"(Yes. That's right.) 
"
11,12,Kyle,"Oh God...
"
4,8,Wendy,"Double-stuffed cookies are my favorite. 
"
7,3,Kenny,"(Me??)
"
13,9,Stan,"Butters. Dude!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Dude, he's farting fire!
"
11,11,Stan,"Get them out of there!
"
15,1,Cartman,"Whoa! Cooool!  Oh wooow! No waaay!  It does e-mail and Web browsing, and it shits in Kyle's mouth?? This is the greatest thing that has ever been invented!!
"
18,6,Randy,"How?!
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Mbien.
"
14,4,Stan,"...Dad, you are my friend.
"
14,4,Randy,"Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)  (I mean, 'Oh.') 
"
18,8,Kyle,"Yeah, you gotta know people.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Well pull harder!
"
18,8,Wendy,"Hey guys, these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it. Thanks. 
"
1,3,Cartman,"Hey, I'll blow your friggin' head off.
"
1,8,Cartman,"And yeah, we want Cheesy Poofs!
"
16,6,Kyle,"How many iPod Nanos is friendship worth? I guess, one.
"
8,11,Kyle,"Thee... uhhh. What if the-?
"
17,8,Butters,"When?
"
1,5,Stan,"No!
"
15,2,Timmy,"Livin' a lie! Timmy!
"
2,12,Randy,"Sharon?
"
15,12,Cartman,"What do you wanna watch, Polly Prissypants?
"
4,16,Cartman,"Dummy, you don't ask if you can go! I'm telling my parents I'm staying at Stan's house, Stan's telling his parents he's staying at Kenny's house, and Kenny's not telling his parents anything, 'cause they're alcoholics and they don't care!
"
15,5,Cartman,"Come on. 
"
16,5,Stan,"I didn't beat up Dr. Oz! Don't be mad at me!
"
2,10,Cartman,"What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?  Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?
"
7,12,Randy,"Ooo, what's that?
"
16,6,Kyle,"We could go to the city pool. They have a water slide
"
18,6,Cartman,"The word is out.  ""Terrance & Phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts."" I tweeted it.  It's trending.
"
8,14,Stan,"Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!
"
14,7,Jimmy,"Out on the beach with my cute little peach where the waves are rolling in so highHolding her hand, our feet on the sand-
"
5,6,Cartman,"Whoa! Heheh.  Whoa!  Whoa! Heheheheheh.  Aw, man, that was awesohome! That one part, with the-uum, with the spider that dropped on ya? Oho, man, that totally got me. That was sweet! Heheh.
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Mkay?
"
17,2,Stan,"I said it's not our responsibility to give them what they want.
"
10,1,Stan,"We don't wanna hear it.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Okay okay, let's stop there for a minute. Remember, on tricka lahty do, that's a ""lahty do"" Okay, really need you guys to enunciate the ""lahty"" Uh, Nadif, if I can get you and Abdikaram to sing the harmony on the second ""yo ho"". And uh, Hashmish, is it? I'm sorry, but you're a little flat. Remember to sing out, don't close your throat, m'kay? So let's go from uh, bar 14. We'll pick up after the quarter rest. Ike? 
"
9,3,Cartman,"That's right. We're not talented. See, we're not the artistic side, we're the thinking side.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Antonio, no!  You son of a bitch chicken from outer space... thing, come back here! 
"
6,13,Stan,"What do we do with it?
"
2,15,Stan,"Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
"
5,7,Kyle,"Oh my God, dude.
"
10,3,Cartman,"This... explains everything.
"
7,13,Kyle,"Because, if we go to the tobacco company, I know exactly what'll happen. They'll take us in, and then Rob Reiner will show up with all the townspeople, holding torches or something, and there'll be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned, and change everyone's minds - this is all following a formula!
"
7,6,Kyle,"Dude, I don't wanna play Detective anymore.
"
14,14,Randy,"Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned.  Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah!  Now uh, switch arms.  Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this?  You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time.  Ugh, I'm tired.
"
16,11,Cartman,"FELLAS! Fellas!
"
11,4,Cartman,"We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him!  You will tell me where your son is!
"
9,14,Randy,"Um, my name's Randy, and... I just, really like beer.
"
16,13,Stan,"For what?
"
15,7,Kyle,"Oh dude! Dude, this is the part I was talking about. Check out the bassline on this! 
"
12,10,Cartman,"And a one, and a two, and a- 
"
17,1,Cartman,"That just so you know, the government is watching everything you do! Always watching! They say it's to keep us safe! But what price is safety, Kyle? 
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, Kyle, what the hell was that?  You need to hold the baby by the legs, not by the head.  What kind of sick weirdo are you?
"
2,7,Cartman,"Yes, please. 
"
7,3,Butters,"Yeah.
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh, you're all not getting it! See, while we're at it, we'll have a balloon instead of a ball, and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug!
"
1,1,Kyle,"How come the visitors aren't coming for him?
"
12,10,Randy,"Oho, oh God, oh God, oh God.  Oh God.  I'm  I'm so  Startled.
"
3,12,Stan,"Yes you can, porky. 
"
3,5,Kyle,"This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen.  Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... 
"
4,1,Stan,"But they're gonna search you on your way back to your cell.
"
18,6,Stan,"So what does that mean? I I can get addicted to everything so I can't enjoy anything?
"
12,8,Kyle,"It's okay. You don't have to feel alone anymore. 
"
9,8,Cartman,"Oh, here we go. See? I told you! If you're so caring, Kyle, why don't you share some of your Jew gold with the people caught in the flood?!
"
3,3,Kyle,"Dude! Just take them off!
"
10,6,Cartman,"You... have that kind of power?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Aaahh! 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
"
6,15,Kyle,"I'm not going back.
"
1,2,Kyle,"Wow, are you gonna do it?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Sir! I paid for that lady, and by taking her, you are no better than a common th-thief!
"
2,16,Kyle,"Oh, God! 
"
6,9,Stan,"Uh, one thing before I continue. Unfortunately we don't have enough of the... free hats for everyone. 
"
18,6,Cartman,"It's done. 
"
6,8,Randy,"That's right, I agree.  And it should be taken off of money as well.  The religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel-  Bwwaaaagh  And we can't let the religious right corrupt our kids.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Wait a minute, the rights to Star Wars, the movies? What the hell is going on here?!
"
4,12,Stan,"This is it. The end of innocence.  This is the loss of that playful youth all our parents told us about.
"
12,13,Stan,"Hey kid, what happened?! I th-I thought you didn't wanna sing and dance anymore?!
"
18,2,Kyle,"Dude, calm down.
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"I'm going whether you like it or not!
"
13,10,Cartman,"The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say ""You slept with my girlfriend,"" and I'll charge you into a head slap.
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, Dad, Stop!
"
1,5,Kenny,"(A big mutant Stan?!)
"
1,4,Cartman,"That dog is a gay homosexual.
"
8,6,Cartman,"I hope they're not Austrians. That's the last thing this town needs. 
"
1,6,Cartman,"Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!
"
2,2,Cartman,"Go, Kenny!
"
14,6,Cartman,"No- nooo.
"
13,7,Butters,"Well, 'cause our lives sucked back home! We had all these rules and homework.
"
16,6,Stan,"So after Asshole gets his biology lesson, we finally get to go ziplining! 
"
18,7,Kyle,"No. Then I came into this virtual space.
"
9,8,Stan,"It's- it's helicopters! They finally came to help everyone! 
"
18,7,Butters,"This is for all the times I got grounded! 
"
5,9,Stan,"But why? Why does a third of the world hate us?
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!  Okay. I'm going to turn around now.  Shit!
"
5,8,Stan,"Don't hurt it! 
"
10,13,Cartman,"Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!
"
17,5,Kyle,"It's my little brother. He's really changing and I feel like-
"
15,9,Stan,"You're a great Meheecan, Butters, but maybe just not a leader of Meheeco.
"
4,9,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
2,11,Kyle,"You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars.
"
5,6,Cartman,"What the hell?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Come on, ho! 
"
9,4,Kenny,"(Me?)
"
6,17,Cartman,"You guys, we have to bring Christmas to those less fortunate!  Now come on!
"
12,7,Kyle,"Dude, they're gonna kill Kenny!
"
4,12,Stan,"What grade are you going into?
"
5,14,Butters,"Well, sure thing, Dad.
"
8,5,Butters,"Hahaa, right! What are you gonna do with money, AWESOM-O? Buy some robot pants? Haha, no! We got each other and that's all we need, AWESOM-O. I'm gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries.
"
15,6,Butters,"An all-new sushi restaurant just opened in town. Try their lunch specials.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
1,7,Cartman,"Kenny's family is so poor that, yesterday, they had to put their cardboard box up for a second mortgage.  I said, your family had to put a cardboard box up for a second mortgage, Kenny!  I'm talking to you Kenny, achtung!  Poor piece of crap.
"
4,14,Timmy,"T-TIIMMAY TIMMAY!
"
8,8,Randy,"Expulsion?!
"
3,2,Mr. Mackey,"Hi, boys.
"
11,5,Stan,"What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us!  Wait... unless... maybe there is.  Here, hold this.  Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. 
"
14,6,Stan,"What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!
"
10,1,Stan,"No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children.
"
9,3,Kyle,"What?
"
7,6,Stan,"Just because your parents can afford better toys than ours doesn't make you better than us!
"
14,14,Stan,"...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you.
"
7,11,Kyle,"What?
"
17,2,Butters,"I was out by the lake last night and I saw my dad out in this field. He was harvesting sugarcane. It didn't make any sense because he was trying to harvest the sugarcane with a hammer. I saw him take my mom up to the top of this big... thing he had built, and he yelled ""Hey, watch out for the Creepers!"" but she fell!
"
12,8,Butters,"The Chinese?
"
13,5,Cartman,"You do?
"
1,2,Wendy,"You guys, we have to stop him!
"
3,12,Kyle,"Wow! That was easy.
"
8,2,Cartman,"Daaaa! Daaaa! '
"
2,7,Kyle,"I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hey, I'm on your guys' side.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Two.
"
10,12,Cartman,"Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?
"
14,14,Randy,"Aw yeah?
"
18,8,Stan,"Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play ""Magic: The Gathering""?
"
8,9,Cartman,"Excuse me! Hello?! Can somebody tell my why we're going to Jim's Drugs to buy Voltar cards when Wall-Mart has them for three bucks cheaper?
"
8,1,Kenny,"(Shuriken. Awesome!)
"
1,11,Stan,"I know.
"
5,11,Kyle,"I have to watch out for my glasses. Ow! Ow, it's so cold! Oh Jesus! 
"
4,13,Cartman,"Oh really?  Then, why don't you hold it?  Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it.  Hold it.
"
14,3,Randy,"Where do we want them?
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"Heyhey, where is little Stanley?
"
18,5,Cartman,"Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.
"
7,6,Kyle,"What do we do now?
"
13,4,Randy,"Aw come on.  Just because you can't queef anymore...
"
18,1,Kyle,"People aren't gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we don't care about anything!
"
10,2,Stan,"Smug?
"
12,3,Butters,"There you go. Well, try some coffee, Ken.
"
9,2,Cartman,"They're not people, they're HIPPIES!
"
3,13,Kyle,"Huuh, I wah... just ah... well... that's all. 
"
18,6,Kyle,"Kenny, who told you about this game?
"
6,5,Cartman,"I'm not a fat turd, I'm a stocky turd!
"
1,7,Stan,"For shocking people who try to give us granola treats, or something.
"
8,10,Stan,"Kyle, Kenny! I have to talk to you right now!
"
5,1,Stan,"Holy shi-  poop.
"
10,6,Kyle,"We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!
"
9,14,Randy,"What?
"
7,6,Kenny,"(Aww, it's okay, little fella.)
"
8,2,Cartman,"Naaaa!
"
13,6,Randy,"Hey guys, Finland's dead.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!
"
11,9,Stan,"You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. 
"
12,3,Cartman,"I've already taken in the Andersons' cats, and the Willinskys'. There's simply nothinng else I can-  Then again... perhaps I could find space for just this one more...
"
8,12,Butters,"I'm sorry.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid before?
"
10,2,Kyle,"Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. 
"
14,8,Kenny,"(No you fucking don't!)
"
7,11,Kyle,"That's not being nice! That's just putting on a nice sweater!
"
9,2,Randy,"Check.
"
3,14,Kyle,"Dude, the Civil War reenactment is tomorrow! You're not gonna get it by tomorrow!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Egh... 
"
1,10,Stan,"Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.
"
14,10,Stan,"Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with.
"
5,1,Stan,"Oh shit!
"
9,3,Kyle,"They did it to us again! That dirty talent agency stole our client again!
"
7,15,Mr. Garrison,"Rats!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Yes, well, I've done my job, haven't I?  ¡Pepite, Pepite, no! No come la taco la trabajar!
"
2,15,Kyle,"Because you're standing over there! 
"
1,11,Wendy,"Well, did you notice that mole on the back of her neck with the hair growing out of it?
"
7,9,Cartman,"Token, look away to the right.  More.  More!
"
17,7,Randy,"No, I was lying to you! I took this job... to be at the front of the line on Black Friday.
"
18,9,Stan,"Why'd you have to rub your clit on stage, Dad?
"
1,3,Stan,"I'm not hysterical, I just don't want to shoot the bunny.
"
4,10,Cartman,"No no, no. Separation.
"
3,15,Stan,"I'll try again.
"
17,3,Cartman,"""Nothin'"" Me neither. Nothin's goin' on. Sucks.  Everything good with you?
"
11,13,Stan,"Just, just a little.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too.  Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Nooo! 
"
2,17,Cartman,"Well, I'll be damned.
"
1,8,Cartman,"That's stupid, who the hell would want to do that?
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Anyway, thanks Stan. And... you know, just keep on, keep on standing your ground, okay? 
"
5,6,Cartman,"But I don't know how it works.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Oh, of course I was lying, Kyle. There's no Jewpacabra. Now, please, Kyle, it's Easter Eve! And if Jewpacabra smells this blood, I am in a heap of trouble!  No Kyle! No, wait! I'm sorry I couldn't help it! Kyle?! Please I'll give you money! I have lots of money!  Oh God, what am I doing?  I mean, I mean, I don't have any money! I'm totally broke!  Oh God, I am in a heap of trouble.
"
10,10,Kyle,"All right! We're getting the hell out of here! 
"
4,8,Cartman,"Ur, s-sorry.  Go ahead.
"
16,13,Stan,"Tell the captain to take off.  People ask me, ""You never took the bracelet off? Not once?""  No. Never. Not. Ever.  What do I do? I Stan ground. 
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Aahhm, I don't know, Eric. I really don't think I want to sign that very much.
"
11,3,Jimmy,"Ur ur re- ur really?
"
3,3,Cartman,"Mom, please can we just leave?
"
3,15,Stan,"It fell; I'll try again.
"
11,11,Stan,"If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"Don't apologize for me to that spearchucker!
"
1,6,Cartman,"I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
"
4,9,Cartman,"So how do boy bands use that?
"
1,5,Kyle,"Wait, what are you taking Stan's blood for?
"
10,8,Cartman,"Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click!  What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! 
"
9,6,Butters,"Uhh alright then. 
"
4,10,Stan,"God damnit!
"
11,9,Stan,"Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready.
"
10,9,Mr. Mackey,"Look, what-ever you believe, the fact of the matter is somebody... dropped a dookie in the school urinal, and there's still no explanation for that!
"
10,6,Kyle,"Cartman, you okay??  You need help??
"
11,5,Kyle,"Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea.
"
5,8,Kyle,"How long has it been since you've been back there.
"
6,1,Stan,"We've gotta get down there! Come on, Not-Kenny! 
"
16,11,Butters,"We're from Hawaii?
"
17,2,Randy,"Sharon, I miss being intimate with you! Everything was so passionate and then it just... dropped off. I feel like we're losing our bond.
"
10,12,Cartman,"Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do.
"
11,14,Kenny,"(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)
"
2,7,Kyle,"Nope.
"
1,7,Cartman,"Hey Kenny, are you gonna eat your pudding?  No Eric, go ahead and take my pudding, if you'd like.  Why thank you Kenny. How nice of you.
"
18,8,Stan,"Dude, Kenny is fighting Slaughterhouse tonight. I mean, no offense, but, we're not gonna miss the fight for... girls volleyball. 
"
5,2,Stan,"What do we want?
"
1,7,Cartman,"Let, let us remember the good times, Kenny would have wanted it that way. 
"
18,1,Kyle,"I don't want to! It's a stupid name! 
"
2,15,Randy,"What is it?
"
2,15,Stan,"Hey. Where did the shirt go?  I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?!  AAAaAaAaAa  I'm not gonna look.  It's not closer. I'm just seeing things.  GAAAH!  AAAAAAAH!!  MOM! Mom! 
"
6,7,Kyle,"Quick. Hide. 
"
8,6,Kyle,"You guys, I feel kinda bad for that kid.
"
15,13,Cartman,"Dude, see? I told you. Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we've got History Channel?
"
10,9,Kyle,"Oh Christ...
"
1,11,Wendy,"Stan, you know it's almost Valentine's Day.
"
4,3,Cartman,"Wha-what? Another gay guy in feathers? 
"
2,14,Cartman,"You got stinky britches, stinky--
"
18,1,Butters,"Yeah, we're sick of school! But all the good attention-getting startup names are taken.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Be sure to help yourselves to the crab soufflé, and uh, eh, Juanita?  Juanita?  We need some more finger sandwiches? 
"
13,12,Cartman,"Agreed.
"
7,3,Stan,"Okay.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"We're alone, now what the hell are we gonna do?
"
3,4,Cartman,"You guys are so wrong about Tweek. He's gonna get his ass kicked.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Butters, you've gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, and do whatever you want all the time, you could miss it.
"
5,6,Kyle,"""Have mercy!""  Yeah ha ha!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Heh!  Oh, oh hey, Butters!  I wasn't expecting you so soon.
"
9,2,Kyle,"Hey, let's ask them. 
"
16,6,Cartman,"Totally fuckin' stupid, dude!
"
9,11,Kyle,"In there! Let's go!  Get this jamb on the door! 
"
10,8,Cartman,"Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks.
"
15,11,Randy,"Alright babe.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Ten dollar? Sucky-sucky?
"
5,6,Stan,"Yeah, it's unbelievable.
"
1,12,Kyle,"I'm going to put it in my room, where Cartman can't find it.
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed?
"
5,3,Kyle,"Haha, hehahaha.
"
4,15,Stan,"Deal, druggie!
"
2,6,Stan,"Oh, my God! They've killed Kenny!
"
18,10,Kyle,"Please, tune in and help get America's families back in the living room.
"
15,14,Cartman,"I'm not saying it!
"
13,2,Cartman,"You gotta be kidding me!
"
2,7,Kenny,"(All I know is that it was a loong time ago, and Death was chasing us on a bicycle down the street.)
"
7,6,Stan,"Look, we said we wanted to form a club to protect and serve South Park. We put all this time to it, I mean... What do you guys wanna do, huh? Go back to playing Car Mechanics? Or Laundromat Owners?
"
9,6,Stan,"Okay, this is everything, mom. 
"
14,10,Stan,"I'm working on it!
"
7,10,Randy,"Dad, what are you doing??
"
4,12,Timmy,"Timmah! Timmaaaaahhh!
"
13,13,Stan,"I looked through your stupid book! It's five hundred and forty pages of ripping on Wendy and calling her a slut!
"
4,3,Randy,"Okay, is everyone ready to go?
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Hello?
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Moooooo!  ...What a terrific audience. 
"
10,12,Cartman,"Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! 
"
1,2,Stan,"Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?
"
16,11,Kenny,"(Butters, come on.)
"
8,5,Cartman,"Weak! 
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yeah. We've come to complain. We don't want a Wall-Mart in our town.
"
2,12,Cartman,"Who the hell are you?!
"
4,12,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, congratulations!
"
13,12,Randy,"Isn't this great food?
"
2,16,Kyle,"Whoa, dude! 
"
10,6,Cartman,"Somebody get us some help down hyah!
"
4,17,Kyle,"It's Mr. Hankey! He hasn't shown up yet.
"
7,5,Kyle,"It isn't fair. I spent weeks preparing my speech on Latino culture.
"
15,7,Stan,"They both look like turds about to be reheated to me.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Awww, I don't think Kyle likes you, Ms. Lopez.
"
8,3,Kenny,"(Hello.)
"
18,7,Butters,"Interim status is go.
"
11,5,Randy,"Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Do you really think information like this will just die down? There's Internet! There's Eavesdropper! You might be worried Pete Melman is gonna kill himself, but the truth is, he was dead the second he crapped his pants.
"
7,12,Randy,"Who are the Harrisons?
"
7,6,Mr. Garrison,"And so you can see, children, that the women's movement of the late fifties and the early sixties had a profound effect on feminism in America.  Uh, boys!  Would it trouble you terribly not to sleep in my class?
"
1,6,Kyle,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!
"
8,14,Butters,"Well but, but what happened?
"
6,6,Stan,"How about Token? 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Kyle, we need to try to find a-
"
12,3,Kenny,"(The titties! Oh my god, they were incredible!)
"
7,1,Kenny,"(I don't know.)
"
11,2,Cartman,"You shut up! You're lying, and  you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews!  OW!  OW! AAAAUH!  NYAAAAAAAAAA!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I said, ""I mean,  Come on!""
"
6,15,Kyle,"Oh cool. We get to watch a movie?
"
1,8,Stan,"This sucks, Starvin' Marvin is our friend.
"
1,1,Cartman,"Shut up, dildo!
"
17,9,Cartman,"Maybe we started to rely on Microsoft and Sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things. Like, like this.  We could just play with this. Screw video games, dude! Who fuckin' needs them?!
"
4,2,Kyle,"I only got a jar of gefilte fish.
"
1,7,Stan,"We told you dude.
"
18,2,Cartman,"My name isn't important. What matters is that... the answer is in the pyramid.
"
1,3,Kyle,"Ready to go hunting, Cartman?
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Oo-kay, aaand, what is your brother's Intelligrated smart name?
"
4,10,Stan,"But what about them?
"
13,4,Stan,"No way! We did it?!  Yeah!!
"
10,13,Cartman,"What??  Who the fuck is this?!
"
5,14,Stan,"Really?
"
1,9,Kenny,"(Kyle's crazy!)
"
6,7,Cartman,"Ah, so great that everything is finally back to normal. 
"
8,6,Cartman,"No.
"
12,9,Cartman,"What?! That's ridiculous!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Alright, go ahead.  AY!... no.  AY!...
"
11,4,Kyle,"...Homeland Security?
"
3,4,Cartman,"Fine! 
"
4,4,Cartman,"Whah!
"
11,9,Randy,"Can I, can I see it?
"
1,5,Kyle,"That's it.  I'm going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and make…pot-bellied elephants.  They'd be smart like elephants, but small like pigs.
"
15,6,Butters,"It's okay, buddy, you've got a smokey on your tail, bug Big Rig Butters is here to help! Vroovrooom. 
"
15,8,Stan,"I'm not friends with him.
"
4,2,Stan,"The kid will never even know.
"
1,7,Stan,"Sweet! 
"
1,3,Kenny,"(Thanks.) 
"
13,7,Cartman,"The FUCK are you pirates doing?! Are we gonna plunder them or not?!
"
16,12,Randy,"Okay...
"
15,5,Cartman,"It's not illegal Kyle. Tell you what: I'll do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it.
"
13,13,Wendy,"Is what true?
"
4,13,Stan,"Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! 
"
2,2,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.
"
6,7,Kyle,"No way.
"
1,1,Cartman,"Well, I'm pissed off!
"
5,5,Kyle,"Well, guys, I guess we're going to Canada.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Who's there?
"
3,3,Cartman,"I can't! They're stapled to my head!  I hate you guys.
"
8,1,Stan,"Oh shit, somebody's coming!
"
6,3,Kyle,"But how are we gonna get the balls put on Butters' chin?
"
12,11,Stan,"Dude, what is this place?
"
5,8,Stan,"We don't care.
"
17,8,Cartman,"Hi, is Kenny home?
"
6,3,Butters,"Serves me right! Puttin' balls on my chin and lyin' about it. Why I, I should be grounded for a month! Why do I do these things? Why can't I behave myself? 
"
4,12,Mr. Mackey,"No, it's really not as nice as you might imagine, Chef, m'kay. 
"
6,8,Stan,"So?
"
13,12,Stan,"Oh that's good.
"
13,4,Stan,"We're complaining to the Canada Network 'cause they put something really gross on TV!
"
17,9,Kyle,"I swear, Stan.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh, whoa. Whoa! 
"
14,2,Butters,"But, you told me I did!
"
7,14,Stan,"But if life is only pain, then... what's the point of living?
"
6,4,Cartman,"What did I tell you, Stan! We save some baby cows from being eaten, and now we're no-good dirty God-damned hippies!
"
1,6,Stan,"What is that?!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Mmmhmm.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Because when Kyle said he heard us say we made the video, we can say we were talking about THIS video. ""Ohh, thank you Eric, that's pretty smart. I really owe you one.""
"
6,3,Cartman,"Yeah, it sucked Hairy Butters' chin balls. 
"
18,9,Kyle,"Because- because that's not even entertainment! I mean, it's just, just, rehashing shit, isn't it?? It's like everything these kids are into these days, you know, it's just... rehashed shit!
"
14,14,Kyle,"Oh this is sweet. I've seen this episode.
"
9,10,Stan,"As a matter of fact,... I think it is the nicest hat I've ever known.  Come on! 
"
17,1,Kyle,"You're okay with everything you think going up on the Internet?
"
13,11,Stan,"What was that? 
"
4,14,Wendy,"My poor little Helen.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Finally!
"
16,8,Stan,"Whoawhoa, you can't, you can't tell me what to do!
"
5,11,Kyle,"It's a really dry cold; that's the problem. It- the cold air makes me wheeze.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Nooo! 
"
7,3,Kyle,"This was supposed to be my story! My coming to terms with a guilty conscience! This isn't fair!
"
4,1,Cartman,"There! 
"
5,3,Stan,"Can you do it again?
"
18,2,Kyle,"Hey, that might work. But it can't be a party for us.
"
2,6,Stan,"Okay. Here we go. Ready? Are you ready, Cartman?
"
18,2,Randy,"We love the city, yeah yeah yeah, 'cause I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde Lorde yeah yeah yeah.
"
9,11,Cartman,"There she is! Get her!  Die, you stupid bitch!
"
5,13,Stan,"...But... he's our... fu... fufu- friend.
"
11,8,Kyle,"Surprise, fatass!
"
6,5,Cartman,"Eewww!
"
7,14,Stan,"Oh whoa, wait a minute.  What did I do wrong? I haven't even talked to Wendy for weeks.  
"
7,4,Stan,"He does? 
"
2,13,Stan,"What are you going to do?
"
9,8,Kyle,"Jews do NOT carry gold in a little bag around their necks.Cartman! Stop playing around!
"
10,8,Randy,"I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online.
"
18,1,Butters,"Somebody raided Kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground!
"
3,8,Stan,"Nice job, Pip.
"
3,2,Stan,"Yeah, he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her. What does that have to do with his death?
"
3,15,Stan,"I'll try
"
15,8,Stan,"You're not listening to me, Kyle. Dude, we have to go do this one thing, and then everything can go back to normal!
"
2,18,Stan,"Dude, you've been frozen 32 months.
"
4,16,Cartman,"Well, I mean, you... could... call the police and have them take your parents away.
"
10,2,Stan,"Come on, people. Come on, people now. 
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, does eveyone have their leotards on? 
"
10,9,Kyle,"Really?
"
9,2,Cartman,"Hit the PA system NOW!  Put me in the main line! 
"
1,7,Cartman,"My mom made it. Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil!
"
3,5,Cartman,"You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.
"
1,3,Cartman,"Drive the car damn-it, drive!
"
16,11,Butters,"Get out of here, all of ya! 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Lame!
"
3,16,Stan,"Come on, Cartman, we have to make plans for New Year's.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
10,12,Butters,"What??
"
2,16,Kyle,"Cartman was right! The holiday season is for idiots!
"
4,10,Stan,"Oh, shit!  Oh!
"
6,7,Cartman,"Yeah! And look! They ride around on turtles and they play games with fish.
"
11,14,Wendy,"Which one? We make lists all the time.
"
6,9,Stan,"...212, 213, 214 members!
"
16,12,Randy,"Who are you people?! You aren't real!
"
5,2,Stan,"Bye, Big Gay Al. We had a great time.
"
7,6,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
3,15,Kyle,"with dreidel I shall play.
"
7,3,Kyle,"But, but he's lying! He doesn't have a conscience!
"
16,14,Cartman,"Haha.
"
12,1,Kyle,"So what?!
"
13,10,Jimmy,"Oowow, it's really him.
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"Ogod, you're not gonna lay that Channukah crap on me, are you?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Because I m-I mean I really think you could have done it for about $12.50.
"
13,3,Kyle,"Well this sucks!
"
16,10,Randy,"Oh, is that so?
"
4,6,Timmy,"Timmiihhh!
"
6,17,Stan,"We're here.
"
10,11,Kyle,"Biggie. Smalls... Biggie Smalls...
"
17,6,Stan,"...Kyle, maybe you should get some help.
"
16,2,Cartman,"Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?
"
16,10,Randy,"Yeah, w-what are they?
"
6,7,Stan,"They've already accomplished so much.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Like look at him. He's always shaking and nervous.
"
5,9,Stan,"'K, let's put him on here. 
"
16,5,Stan,"Wha? What's the movie studio saying about it?
"
7,3,Stan,"Let's go, Kyle! 
"
14,14,Randy,"Ugh. I'm not staying up to do that Sharon, jeez!
"
12,9,Wendy,"What?
"
1,2,Kyle,"Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard! 
"
7,10,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
8,14,Stan,"All right, I'm going now. 
"
3,8,Randy,"What the hell is that supposed to mean?!
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Okay. I can do that.)  (Christ!) 
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, I bet this is it! Here it comes.
"
2,4,Stan,"Well, dude, you better find out!
"
4,2,Kyle,"See ya.
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman.
"
17,7,Cartman,"We are getting XBox Ones, guys! And that is final!
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"And now children, our friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering.
"
18,9,Randy,"Okay, hold on! A, I don't have a clit, so technically, I wasn't rubbing anything! And B, I didn't want to even perform tonight, but Stanley gave all our money to Canada through a freemium game, so if anyone rubbed their clit, it was him! 
"
11,7,Randy,"We don't have any change! Go away!
"
4,12,Stan,"We travel back in time.
"
10,7,Cartman,"You're sterile, is that it?  No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it?  Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless.
"
12,8,Kyle,"Yeah he's an idiot but uh I'm sorry, I just... I can't do this anymore, okay? I... I can't do this anymore! 
"
16,9,Kyle,"Are you serious?? Look around: doesn't this bother you at all??  That's YOU one day, fatass! Not even one day! If you don't change something, that's you! In about a year! 
"
9,10,Wendy,"But I made that egg. Mr. Garrison, please. Youyou can't give my egg to Stan, he'll break it.
"
16,5,Butters,"My grandma??
"
16,4,Cartman,"Now we head back to Colorado, here.  We need to get my video of the Jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it.
"
15,13,Kyle,"Dude, look, we, we just saw all this stuff on History Channel.
"
11,2,Cartman,"...Lame.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Yes! Praise the Lord!
"
13,10,Butters,"That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!
"
6,1,Cartman,"The fat one!
"
12,11,Cartman,"Dude, it's Craig!
"
11,5,Kyle,"You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?
"
1,13,Kyle,"Hunh?
"
5,1,Kyle,"Dude, this plague is spreading like wildfire! 
"
2,11,Kenny,"(Okay. Got to have some huggin'.) 
"
1,13,Stan,"Cartman? What the hell are you doing dresed up like an Indian with a bear necklace?
"
16,6,Kyle,"Face it Stan! Nobody's coming for us! 
"
14,4,Stan,"My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else.
"
14,10,Wendy,"Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?
"
5,1,Kenny,"(Yeah, I didn't- 
"
2,7,Kyle,"Hey, look. The aliens are getting ice cream.
"
5,8,Stan,"Okay, we will.
"
10,1,Cartman,"Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!
"
10,9,Stan,"Is the whole government in on this?
"
13,10,Stan,"Irene, you said you loved me!
"
16,12,Cartman,"Cartman SMASH! 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!
"
13,10,Kyle,"So what do we do?
"
7,5,Kyle,"So stop doing it!
"
13,14,Kyle,"No they don't!
"
2,4,Kyle,"But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
"
15,11,Randy,"And after ""Lion King"" in New York? ""Godspell""? ""Mamma Mia""?
"
8,11,Stan,"Yeah, Sexy Action, that's good.
"
1,6,Stan,"Totally dude.
"
6,7,Stan,"...Close your eyes and suck it out of a hose?
"
5,8,Stan,"Hurry up, stupid parachute!
"
18,7,Butters,"Aaaaah! Yes! Y-yes everything's fine!
"
10,13,Cartman,"Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans. 
"
9,1,Cartman,"You guys, Mr. Garrison has titties.
"
7,8,Cartman,"Nice jacket, Kyle! Polyester is really the hot fabric this fall! 
"
16,14,Kyle,"I didn't wanna have to do this.  but if you don't tell us, I'm gonna tell your dad you helped get the wrong person elected President!
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Uh huh!)
"
3,5,Cartman,"Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!
"
1,3,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, he has Patrick Duffy for a leg, and weaves baskets.
"
7,6,Cartman,"We're going to need semen samples from everything in this room. 
"
9,10,Kyle,"I don't think it's gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking. This whole assignment is stupid.
"
5,10,Mr. Mackey,"Okay Eric, as your counselor, uh I want you to feel comfortable talking about anything, m'kay?
"
5,9,Stan,"We sent the Afghani kids some dollars - they must have sent us something cool in return! &lt;/i&gt; Do you have some scissors to get this open?
"
9,11,Cartman,"Huh?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! 
"
8,2,Kyle,"I didn't come here to talk about The Passion, Cartman!
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, we're gonna crash!
"
11,10,Kyle,"God damnit!
"
18,3,Stan,"I, I just... Two people close to me are having gender identity issues and I'm, I'm confused.
"
11,2,Kyle,"Butters is staying over tonight?
"
7,6,Butters,"Okay.  Ow. Ooww!
"
18,1,Cartman,"You guys! You guys, it's awesome! Holy shit you guys!  You guys, I've got it!
"
9,10,Wendy,"No. No, that's my egg.
"
18,7,Kyle,"We're right here dude. Do you remember now?
"
1,3,Stan,"I'll kill you!
"
2,2,Stan,"Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?
"
5,1,Kyle,"The knights of Standards and Practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum. ""Curse words"" They're called that because they are a curse. We have to go back to only using curse words in rare, extreme circumstances.
"
15,6,Butters,"Uh, well, to solve mysteries.
"
1,6,Cartman,"Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again.
"
2,11,Stan,"Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too.
"
8,14,Stan,"I took them to see how abortions are done.
"
13,14,Randy,"No, wait, wait! Ugh. Eugh. I... I'm okay.
"
16,3,Butters,"Equipment is flying in, ten seconds.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Right, I already got that one.
"
6,17,Jimmy,"On the fifth... day... day of... Christmas,  ...my t-true love gave to... uh... me. Five g-g-g... golden ruh-ring... rings.  Fuhgom... don... t-t... don... four cal...ling buh-irr
"
11,4,Kyle,"Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Is this some kind of joke? We are two weeks into tent rehearsals! Who the heck would sit at home watching the royal wedding?!
"
9,3,Kyle,"Yes he does!
"
5,5,Kyle,"Well, maybe we can sneak in over there. Come on.  Sshh. 
"
1,12,Cartman,"No way! You gave it to us-it's mine now!
"
4,12,Kyle,"How?
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Yeah, b-bigger, stronger! 
"
4,6,Cartman,"Well, Butters, there is no I in ""team.""
"
14,5,Cartman,"Uh, excuse us for a second... 
"
12,8,Kyle,"Aw it's horrible! 
"
9,11,Kyle,"Aah I think you'd rather hear this in private!
"
12,10,Stan,"I gotta get home for dinner.
"
1,8,Kyle,"Totally. 
"
3,3,Stan,"Huh?
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a two-timin' whore. From now on, children, you're all gonna be learning from Mr. Twig.
"
2,2,Cartman,"I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
"
13,1,Kyle,"I guess so. She's, like, his first real girlfriend ever.
"
9,7,Stan,"A hundred dollar gift certificate to South Park Mall?  Maybe we should do the talent show.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Look, fellas, I've got a real problem with the direction our news show is going! We're dumbing down the school!
"
16,4,Cartman,"No! No! The bread is all flat! No!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Token, you're... waiting tables?
"
6,10,Stan,"Hoh! 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Oolih oo livin' a lie, Timmehuh!
"
15,1,Cartman,"But I told you I was sorry.
"
17,9,Stan,"Yes, it is.
"
17,1,Cartman,"I was um, sure that the appointment was today.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus.
"
9,3,Kenny,"(Hey, terrific!)
"
15,4,Kyle,"Well everyone has already seen it; nothing we can do about it now.
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"Mayor, the little jakovasaurs are ruining my classroom. I can't teach our kids anything!
"
11,5,Stan,"Snowball! 
"
4,17,Kyle,"...We actually spoke—to the Brian Boitano.
"
9,3,Stan,"This is just the beginning. I bet we start to see all kinds of offers comin' in for Token now.
"
14,4,Stan,"Oh yeah? I can try! 
"
5,10,Kyle,"...Nuh uh.
"
18,2,Kyle,"Well, I guess let's just be thankful we're not Butters. They won't even let him come back to school.
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
17,1,Cartman,"For everything bad I've ever done?
"
10,6,Cartman,"You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Hey! That was Kyle that went #2 in the urinal!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Happy Birthday, Kyle. I just wanted to stop by and give you your present.
"
5,7,Kyle,"Seventeen? 
"
13,7,Butters,"Jeez. Guess we kind of got put in our place, huh Ike?
"
10,13,Cartman,"Here. 
"
6,16,Cartman,"Thanks. But you know, all this talk about future selves has made me think, maybe I should ...take better care of myself. I mean, maybe I should think about who I'm going to become.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
"
2,4,Kyle,"I can't believe my parents are cannibals!
"
1,12,Cartman,"Oh I'll find it, don't worry!  God - dammit, give me my triangle, Kyle, seriously.
"
8,8,Kyle,"Cartman? What the hell?!
"
3,2,Kyle,"She's not worried about you.
"
2,13,Kyle,"What'd you say, Cartman??
"
2,7,Kyle,"Oh, she would, dude. She would. 
"
16,1,Stan,"How expensive?
"
12,1,Stan,"What's going on? Are we in trouble?
"
14,5,Kyle,"Dude, what did you do?
"
6,17,Kyle,"Is that what this is all about?!  You came up with this whole idea so you could get a stupid toy?! 
"
4,2,Kyle,"Dude, this book says I don't exist unless I think I do. But what if I don't?
"
10,1,Cartman,"Come on, bitch! Dance!
"
14,3,Cartman,"You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Wow, I get it now! I get it!  Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny.
"
3,6,Kyle,"Do you?
"
2,2,Kenny,"(Okay, I've reached the generator)
"
13,5,Jimmy,"You can check the freezer. There might be some frozen fishsticks or somethin', if you like fishsticks. 
"
15,4,Butters,"And so then, and so then it turns out the Terminator secretly had a kid, ten years ago. Meaning Terminator could be his own father. And then Skeletor gets angry and wants to fight him.
"
6,13,Randy,"Yeah, whatever.
"
4,16,Kyle,"But Mom, I-
"
13,10,Cartman,"Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again.  We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?
"
3,3,Kyle,"Dude! I hate Mr. Derp!
"
5,14,Butters,"Hey, you stop hollerin'! It's your anniversary.
"
5,5,Kyle,"You can't leave! The show starts soon!
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Do you think he blames you for somethin'?
"
9,9,Butters,"Well, I'm just a typical little girl. I like dancin' and ponies. a-and  getting my snootch pounded on Friday night.
"
12,3,Mr. Mackey,"Well, it's a it's not actually cat urine, but male cats, when they're marking their territory, uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and... a-and that could get you really high. M'kay? Re-really reeeally high. Okay?  Probably shou-shouldn't have told you that just now. Hm'kay? Tha, that was probably bad.
"
4,13,Kyle,"Here we go again.
"
18,6,Stan,"You buy Canadian coins so you have Canadough.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh. 
"
9,6,Kyle,"Beause he's a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Oh hey Butters. Sup?
"
1,6,Stan,"I'm not going to kill you grampa!
"
9,6,Butters,"Nuh-nothing to be scared of. Jus, just some lightning and thunder.  Gah! Wasn't nothin' neither. J-just a mouse. 
"
6,6,Jimmy,"Oh boy! Oh thank God! 
"
2,7,Stan,"Hey, Cartman!
"
1,4,Kyle,"Hut.
"
10,3,Stan,"Yeah.
"
3,8,Stan,"I don't care, just hurry! 
"
4,13,Stan,"What the hell just happened?
"
5,13,Cartman,"...You know, it's funny, Kenny. Stan and Kyle have always been sort of two best friends, you know, and... well I- I don't know if I ever told you this, Kenny, but um... I kind of always thought you were my best f-friend. I don't know.
"
5,8,Kyle,"All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Why, Mr. Freely?
"
3,3,Stan,"Well, we couldn't even talk to him. She's so evil. She has him totally kept away from us.
"
7,11,Cartman,"No! Butters! I can't let you risk it. I'll go up and get the others.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Oh yeah, I guess that doesn't make sense. 
"
15,4,Randy,"Aw, suck it! All o'ya!
"
8,9,Stan,"No, dude, don't! 
"
15,9,Kyle,"""Wanted by U.S. Border Patrol""?! ""Permission to shoot on sight""?!
"
9,13,Kyle,"You can? Awesome!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Last joke ever? What's that supposed to mean? 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Nuh uh!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Yeah, he killed himself.
"
10,9,Cartman,"You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media!  I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! 
"
13,2,Stan,"Dude, what the hell?
"
1,11,Kyle,"My laundry detergent?
"
6,17,Jimmy,"...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear t...t...tree. On the third day of C...Chrihhh...Chriiii...
"
11,13,Stan,"That'd be awesome!
"
4,11,Cartman,"For he is LordLord, Lord, LordRight here we have a little girl who is very, very ugly! Do you believe he is gonna cure your face of the uglies?!
"
2,13,Kyle,"After all that?! Shenanigans! Shenanigans! SHENANIGANS! 
"
9,9,Cartman,"Don't be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?
"
4,17,Stan,"Tralalalala
"
1,10,Kyle,"Uuuuh. Stan?
"
8,1,Butters,"Haaa ha ha ha ha!  Well well well! If it isn't the four ninjas!
"
4,16,Stan,"You mean in the before time? In the long, long ago?
"
13,2,Cartman,"I got boned! That's what I did, Mom! I try to do good stuff and nobody even notices!
"
2,4,Cartman,"I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck.
"
4,13,Stan,"Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. 
"
6,16,Randy,"Uh..  Look, it was fake in the future, too. 
"
17,6,Stan,"Dick! That's a dick talking! You've had too much of Cartman's farts and you got sulphur poisoning, and now you're a dick.
"
11,1,Cartman,"Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token.  He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in.
"
11,2,Kyle,"You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!
"
2,6,Cartman,"I know that!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Wwow!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Welcome to our offices, Token. As you can see, we are quite a successful company. Did you notice the fountain? Pretty nice, hm?  Come on over this way, Token.  Guys, you remember Token. He's thinking about becoming a client.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!
"
3,13,Kyle,"Uh. All I did was show her how to-
"
13,14,Stan,"All right, they finally came for us. 
"
1,8,Stan,"Shut up butt-pirate, I'm trying to hear.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Nice of you to show up! We were just discussing how we should state our case.
"
17,1,Cartman,"You're what? What, you say?
"
13,4,Randy,"What does that have to do with anything? 
"
7,7,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
12,2,Stan,"We should have just left her alone. But we just had to push her.
"
1,1,Cartman,"No!
"
15,8,Wendy,"This isn't fair! How can the school make us get vaccinated?
"
2,11,Cartman,"I'm over here. 
"
6,13,Stan,"Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
"
13,6,Stan,"Alien?
"
11,6,Stan,"No ma'am.
"
4,12,Mr. Mackey,"Well, we really haven't ll-looked.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Jimmy Buffett?!
"
4,7,Stan,"It was all a trick. Your mom undid the kidney blocker, and then we put ketchup on your bed so you'd think we took your kidney.
"
8,4,Stan,"Okay, good.
"
9,2,Cartman,"I want the batteries for it too. And I get to drive it around in the school parking lot.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Butters.
"
18,7,Butters,"Okay, subject is ready.
"
13,12,Mr. Mackey,"Now just what the heck is going on here?! This is not what we have taught you in this school! Kyle and Stan, you've always been tolerant of gay people!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Argh!
"
1,2,Stan,"Yeah, that'd be cool.
"
10,2,Randy,"I'm...  I'm not ready...
"
3,15,Stan,"to make it spin.
"
12,11,Randy,"Gotta get out!
"
4,2,Cartman,"No, Mother! No more lies! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Okay, yeah, maybe.  God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us.
"
2,17,Cartman,"Ey!
"
4,7,Cartman,"No. Because. It doesn't belong to Kyle, it belongs to me! It's MINE!
"
8,8,Mr. Mackey,"It's pretty close, but it looks like Giant Douche is gonna win.
"
1,13,Cartman,"Yo, Pops!
"
11,5,Randy,"Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. 
"
1,7,Stan,"Cartman, those pictures were taken like, last month.
"
2,17,Kenny,"(Fuck you!)
"
3,4,Cartman,"Come on, Craig! Time to kick his ass! 
"
10,10,Kyle,"Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.
"
15,5,Cartman,"But then, who was the guitar player for Guns N' Roses?
"
4,3,Randy,"Heh, it's 11 o'clock and she's still sleeping.
"
12,6,Randy,"Oh niice... Whoa... 
"
4,17,Stan,"Okay.  One.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Ike! You are no longer to watch that stupid little YouTube blogging asshole! Do you understand?! You damn kids following these YouTube commentators is bad enough, but i will not have them invading my living room!
"
11,10,Stan,"Dude, why did you ever agree to suck his balls in the first place.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person.
"
6,4,Stan,"Pick me up. I... I want to see. 
"
6,4,Butters,"Aw, we're still grounded?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Well, there's a whole crappy band here!  Can you hear them? Here. Can you hear them? 
"
12,12,Mr. Garrison,"We'll probably be dead by sunrise!
"
12,8,Cartman,"Good! Did you kill him? 
"
10,4,Cartman,"How the hell did you get out?
"
4,10,Cartman,"Dude, he's Jewish. He doesn't have to confess his sins.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! 
"
12,13,Jimmy,"All righty then.
"
15,9,Cartman,"Clyde?!  The fuck are you doin'?! You just let a Mexican through!
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"We're out.  We're all out of toppings! There's nothing left to eat.
"
2,5,Kyle,"You... bastards...
"
15,4,Butters,"Hey wait, the cold is making it shrink some. Where're you going, little feller?
"
2,2,Kyle,"Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!
"
12,14,Cartman,"Well, Mom, apparently Butters is gay, finds me very attractive, and, confused about his sexual identity, puked up all over my floor!
"
2,9,Cartman,"Yeah, I love these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef. 
"
16,3,Stan,"Can we get a different pose, please? 
"
7,15,Stan,"What's going on??
"
18,7,Butters,"Ahhh!
"
4,1,Kyle,"Listen, aggotfay! An ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray!
"
7,6,Stan,"We go get the doll ourselves.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Well, Nut Gobbler, I need to get laid.
"
16,13,Stan,"No! I never cut if off!
"
8,4,Kyle,"We're not interested, thanks.
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Ah, thanks for comin', Kyle.
"
2,3,Stan,"Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?
"
4,13,Cartman,"Ech! Screw you guys. Home. 
"
4,12,Timmy,"AAAAAAA! 
"
15,6,Butters,"Thanks. I'm just glad the whole thing is over and done. Maybe now poor old Dr. Janus can finally get the help he needs.
"
6,5,Stan,"Dude!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hate you guys.
"
4,3,Kyle,"Yeah, we've shown them amusement parks and malls. How can you expect them to go back now??
"
6,4,Cartman,"Hell, I'm not goin' with you!
"
8,11,Cartman,"How about we have us, um... hmmm.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Heh, don't, don't tell him what it is, dude.
"
1,9,Mr. Mackey,"Now, uh, Kyle, as your school counselor, uh I want to try and help you confront your problems, 'kay?
"
4,8,Wendy,"Not bad at all. I may make that our first argument. 
"
4,15,Cartman,"Suck my balls, 20!
"
9,14,Randy,"How about twenty?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Thanks, Eric, for being so understanding.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Ey, sweet!  Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her.
"
6,6,Butters,"Very well. You called out Professor Chaos, and you also called out, eh your own demise!  Go now, my minions. Go and take this, this foolish mortal down!  Aw minions, naw, not that way. He-  come back minions.
"
17,6,Kyle,"He said they come on urgent business.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Aw man, this is gonna be awesome!  Butters, if you don't let go of my hand, everyone here is gonna think we're gay!
"
5,7,Cartman,"Ooo, Butters? You're in big trouble now.
"
13,9,Cartman,"Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
"
3,6,Cartman,"All I know is, I got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes; I'm telling you guys, suing people kicks ass!
"
2,5,Stan,"We're losing men fast out here! 
"
6,17,Kyle,"Yeah. 
"
15,4,Butters,"Hey Eric.
"
10,8,Butters,"I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Dammit, here!)
"
12,3,Kyle,"And you don't see any parallel between that and anything else in history?
"
12,13,Cartman,"And I like nothin' better than makin' fun of Jews.
And ripping on black people, though some people think it's rude, but you gotta- 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Who cares??
"
15,8,Kyle,"You were sticking these in your ass, Cartman?!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Damnit! 
"
1,13,Stan,"Uuh, you'll see.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Oh really?! Then how come Gordon Stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day?!
"
11,1,Randy,"And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation.  It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the ""nigger"" guy.  You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on ""Wheel of Fortune"", you know and... and when people call me... ""nigger guy""... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. 
"
3,10,Stan,"Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?
"
5,4,Kyle,"Oh.  No you didn't!
"
16,7,Cartman,"I'm gonna get you! 
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Eric Cartman to the counselor's office please.
"
11,2,Kyle,"Yeah huh!
"
15,9,Kyle,"So then don't have a slumber party if you're gonna be an asshole all night!
"
10,8,Randy,"Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys? 
"
4,1,Cartman,"They're gonna put me in jail for a hate crime! You have to take me to Mexico!
"
15,5,Kyle,"No way.
"
11,5,Randy,"Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters, don't start playing the blame game here, okay?! You and Kenny are just as responsible! And the next time you wanna shove me, just remember, I'm covering your ass! 
"
1,10,Cartman,"Oh, here comes the unholy butthole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!
"
3,14,Stan,"Aw, the hell with it. Let's go home.  Thanks a lot, Bill Clinton!
"
6,14,Randy,"Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were.
"
10,9,Kyle,"So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?
"
3,9,Kyle,"It's a duck. 
"
10,8,Stan,"Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!
"
13,13,Cartman,"Papa Smurf was displeased at first,  He told Smurfette I wasn't a real Smurf and we could never be happy. But I eventually proved myself to Papa Smurf by picking more Smurfberries than any Smurf had ever Smurfed before. Finally, all was right with the world. But then, a crisis. Clumsy Smurf burst into the Smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of Smurfland.
"
12,13,Wendy,"We don't care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair. 
"
17,7,Stan,"If I see you at the mall, Kyle, I will have to try to beat you inside.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, ""You-hoo""...
"
8,1,Cartman,"Butter- Butters!
Kyle:
Hey Butters!
"
14,2,Kyle,"What? 
"
17,9,Cartman,"Dude, shut the fuck up!
"
16,13,Randy,"All the years of being told somethin'. It's just so unfair!
"
4,1,Cartman,"O ho ho, sweet. Later, dudes. 
"
7,6,Stan,"Cartman! Cartman! We just got a tip that a doll was found near Fosse's house!
"
3,7,Cartman,"I'm gonna tell my mom on you.
"
13,10,Kyle,"Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
"
8,1,Butters,"You guys can't fix my eyeball! You have to take me to the hospital! 
"
9,8,Cartman,"I'm not playing around, Kyle! If we survive this, I don't intend to live in poverty! Give me your Jew gold now!
"
15,7,Stan,"He said I have cynicism?
"
7,12,Randy,"Hey, Stan, don't denounce our religion.
"
6,12,Stan,"No cloud city, not even a giant. Heaven must still be a long way off.
"
3,3,Kyle,"It's great to have you back Chef!
"
8,6,Kyle,"And where is your mom?
"
16,14,Kyle,"What?!
"
15,8,Stan,"But Kyle, it's all shit! For real! It's all shit 'cause the aliens with AI and you and me are gonna fuck it all up! Come on! 
"
1,13,Cartman,"Then you did sleep with my mom?
"
1,5,Cartman,"Whaaat?!
"
16,13,Butters,"I donno. I got mine down at 7-11.  See? Right here. 
"
16,8,Cartman,"Holy shit I think I do.
"
10,8,Kyle,"What's the autolocate macro?
"
9,12,Stan,"Dude, this is my room!
"
16,14,Stan,"Well, we tried, dude.
"
1,10,Kyle,"And neither were you, Pip!
"
10,6,Mr. Mackey,"Uhhh, ohhhkay, thank you Mr. Gore.
"
2,4,Stan,"Your eyes? 
"
6,11,Stan,"But why do I have to leave?
"
14,7,Kyle,"If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.
"
17,3,Butters,"Yes.
"
11,11,Butters,"Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters.
"
13,2,Kyle,"Hey. Hey, you're that Mysterion kid.
"
3,11,Cartman,"Oh! Aww!  Oh, weak! 
"
16,14,Cartman,"Shhh, it's okay, Butters.  Nobody's gonna find the election ballots.  I have them hidden away somewhere... nobody would ever look.  A place in town people barely even know exists.
"
13,9,Butters,"Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. ""The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'"" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. 
"
3,17,Cartman,"Stan, what's a queef?
"
7,12,Stan,"Huh?
"
5,13,Stan,"Hey, Kenny!  Oh no.  No.
"
18,3,Wendy,"How's it hanging'?
"
16,8,Butters,"Stay positive, Stan! All right guys, cuddle up, cuddle up!  Now what is goin' on out there?
"
18,7,Cartman,"How would I know that the nurse is about to walk through that door? 
"
1,1,Stan,"Chef!!
"
18,7,Butters,"Take that, you dumb hooker!
"
12,10,Randy,"Ohhh neato, it's one of those Peruvian pan flute bands. Stan, go out and stand with them. I can get a shot. 
"
12,8,Cartman,"It doesn't matter, Butters! You never shoot a guy in the dick. Everyone knows that! Shooting a guy in the dick? That's just, that's just weak. I can't believe you, Butters.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Not like that!
"
3,10,Kyle,"Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
"
6,4,Stan,"Okay, fine Butters! I guess you're not a team player! We'll bring them to my house.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Silver Bells, Silver Bells, it's Christmas time in the city...
"
3,15,Kyle,"Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
15,13,Stan,"We all have to do this report together, dude.
"
5,6,Kenny,"(No, swear to God it's true! Cartman's got a million dollars!)
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"You catch any of that, Kyle? 
"
10,8,Stan,"He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
"
18,2,Stan,"Let me talk to my dad! 
"
16,14,Cartman,"I'm sorry, but I know my rights. You can't search my room without a warrant. And I'm afraid I can't give you permission.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Go, fatass!
"
3,3,Kyle,"This is totally what's happening!
"
5,3,Cartman,"No, Paula Poundstone! Leave me alone! Eyuh! Uh? 
"
1,2,Cartman,"Nothing..!
"
4,9,Stan,"Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
"
18,9,Randy,"Could you um, pass the potatoes, Stan?  Great, thanks.  Well, nobody's talking. Does anyone have anything to talk about?
"
6,4,Stan,"This isn't a game, Mom. We're not coming out until know the calves will be safe.
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, there's not much you can do about a succubus. Their evil power makes man blind to love.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"You bet. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"...Token. Do you want me to pass her a jelly bean?
"
12,1,Cartman,"All right!
"
10,6,Randy,"ManBearPig?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Holy fuck, dude.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Come on, you Frenchy little frog!
"
12,6,Randy,"A television! 
"
1,1,Stan,"Visitors!
"
4,9,Timmy,"Timmuh! 
"
9,4,Cartman,"That's right. Kenny and I have been BFFs since first grade. Here, look.  Kenny has the other half of this BFF necklace. I believe you all know what that means, and how serious this is.
"
6,13,Stan,"Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video.
"
16,12,Stan,"No no! We weren't gonna go there!
"
13,14,Randy,"I'll do it.  You can test the antidote on me. 
"
4,9,Stan,"Oh, yes we do.
"
3,3,Stan,"Could you just hand us some food please?
"
8,8,Kyle,"Be sure to vote for Giant Douche.
"
4,16,Cartman,"No, but you've gotta cry, like this:  ""My parents molestered me.""  And then they'll say something like, ""Was it a good touch or a bad touch?"" and you say  ""Uh, it was a good touch"" or- no wait,  you say it was a bad touch.
"
16,3,Kyle,"Yeah, that's awesome.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden.
"
10,11,Jimmy,"Du... du... dude.
"
8,7,Stan,"They took yer jarb!!
"
5,7,Kyle,"Yeah... Chef, what's ""laid""?
"
11,4,Kyle,"Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
"
18,3,Cartman,"I want her suspended, and I want charges brought up for sexual harassment!
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Uh huh.)
"
9,3,Kyle,"Wing?
"
2,7,Stan,"Well, I guess nobody else will be getting off the bus.
"
2,12,Stan,"Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
"
9,3,Cartman,"I'm making it look like important people call us.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Hang on, I'm-I'm, coming. 
"
6,17,Randy,"Stan!
"
3,7,Cartman,"O-kay! Let's see heuh. Haha! Um... Aw, damnit!  AAAAH! 
"
17,7,Randy,"Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat.  Please to put a penny in the old man's-
"
9,3,Cartman,"Naw, sh-she was with you!
"
6,4,Cartman,"O! At least I have as ass, Jew!
"
6,9,Stan,"Goddamnit, that pissed me off!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's quiet down so the nice bus driver can concentrate on the road.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Hey!
"
12,13,Cartman,"Don't stress about it or you just might faint.
"
2,8,Kyle,"I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Oh, that's so sweet you guys.  You wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while? Heheheheheh 
"
17,8,Kyle,"Grounded? For what?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Extra crispy? 
"
12,10,Stan,"This is a mistake, sir, we aren't really a Peruvian flute band.
"
18,6,Stan,"The addict people said something about me filling a hole.
"
15,4,Cartman,"For what?!
"
2,10,Stan,"Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
"
7,9,Butters,"Cheese!
"
5,10,Stan,"Goddamnit Cartman, what?! 
"
16,12,Kyle,"The judging's almost done. You're gonna make it.  Oh God.  SOMEBODY GET ME A CHARGER!  Hold on Stan! Don't die on us!
"
8,4,Stan,"All right, we gotta find three other kids that can dance.
"
17,10,Butters,"Lisa? Lisa Berger? Anybody seen Lisa Berger?  Oh hey, Eric. Have you seen Lisa Berger anywhere?
"
16,1,Cartman,"I know dude. The bathroom is the last bastion of American freedom.
"
11,1,Cartman,"Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"What? Oh, thanks, man.
"
13,12,Stan,"There's fags everywhere!
"
16,2,Kyle,"Yeah!
"
13,4,Randy,"Sharon! Marsh!
"
15,8,Kyle,"Look, dude, things around here have changed. Sometimes, the only way to keep going is to make a left turn.
"
3,12,Cartman,"So where the hell are we going to get a dead body?
"
16,12,Randy,"Little fucking pricks. 
"
7,5,Cartman,"What the hell are you doing?
"
9,10,Stan,"That...  That's the real egg with Garrison's signature?
"
10,8,Cartman,"Christ...
"
9,11,Cartman,"What we begin here, we will take worldwide, until the blood of every non-ginger child has been spilled! 
"
2,7,Kyle,"Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!
"
4,13,Kyle,"Got 'em!
"
8,11,Kyle,"Eric, sources are speculating that third-grade student, Pete Thelman , pees sitting down like a girl. We've also got confirmation that Sally Turner  stuffs her bra. And Clyde Donovan has only one testicle.
"
17,10,Cartman,"Uh oh.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Alright, we've got power. Prepare for takeoff.
"
16,13,Kyle,"You probably should come clean and tell the truth. Did you superglue your bracelet?
"
14,3,Cartman,"I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. 
"
16,10,Cartman,"My password is uloveboobs!
"
8,5,Butters,"I've got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Oh nonononono, not yet, Kyle. Hold on.  Everyone! Everyone, can I have your attention please? 
"
7,6,Cartman,"Okay. 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Hey, the fountains you guys installed are shorting out some of our lights.
"
8,11,Cartman,"...Hard-hitting reporting, Stan. Thanks a lot. And now, here with the celebrity watch is Butters Stotch. Butters, seen any celebrities?
"
8,11,Kyle,"Butters, get away from me!
"
9,7,Cartman,"All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with ""Wow, how insightful.""
"
18,7,Butters,"NO!
"
16,3,Stan,"Oh, hey, guys. How's it going? 
"
3,17,Kyle,"Yeah, dude!
"
10,8,Cartman,"We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance.
"
4,10,Cartman,"I felt it, you guys. I felt the angry hands of God.  He is an angry God, you guys. We all have to start taking this very seriously.
"
11,1,Randy,"What do you want?
"
15,10,Butters,"There he is!  It's Lemmiwinks! 
"
1,11,Stan,"Bluuch! I'd love to. 
"
4,12,Cartman,"Yeah, we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it.
"
18,4,Randy,"I am Lorde. Lawdy Lawdy Lorde.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Shh, quiet, Cupid Me.
"
3,16,Cartman,"What's the matter, Kyle?
"
18,8,Stan,"Pfft whatever.
"
1,6,Kenny,"(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)
"
13,12,Cartman,"You call them ""bike-curious"".
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Rih, r-r-really?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Alright.  Hey, this is great! 
"
10,6,Kyle,"What the hell is that?  Oh my God. 
"
16,6,Cartman,"We should have never listened to you, Kyle.
"
12,9,Jimmy,"Before school starts. Everyone's gonna get there early.
"
13,13,Stan,"Listen, just because a guy's voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book, doesn't mean he has any idea what he's talking about!
"
6,4,Randy,"Stanley, they belong to him.
"
14,5,Cartman,"I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father.
"
6,5,Stan,"Come on, we gotta go somewhere else! 
"
6,16,Stan,"Butters, don't you think it's a little bit of a coincidence that both your future self and my future self got caught in a mexterdexed time plane? 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Aha, charade you are! Looks like you're the turd now!
"
9,8,Randy,"Don't blame the mayor, Sharon. What about FEMA? Think this whole thing is really their fault.
"
15,14,Kyle,"That's what you care about?! Who's the poorest kid in school now?!
"
3,7,Cartman,"What the hell is wrong with you?! Stop it, Kitty!
"
2,16,Stan,"But they don't care about me, they just want to punish me.
"
2,8,Stan,"Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
"
2,12,Randy,"Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say.
"
2,9,Stan,"To the sewer, dude.
"
17,5,Kyle,"I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.
"
6,4,Kyle,"All right!
"
14,3,Randy,"I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.
"
15,8,Cartman,"I'm sorry Kyle, but if we compromise our final cooking process, then our patented flavor will be everywhere, and we'll have to go back to school. Now, let me get those hamburgers.  Alright, these are good to go! 
"
17,10,Butters,"She's pretty!
"
2,18,Stan,"Right on.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, do you feel better about all this?
"
8,12,Butters,"Well, no, not quite.
"
1,1,Stan,"Now, do you believe this, Cartman?
"
1,13,Cartman,"And my friend Kyle has - a dad, and my friend Kenny has a dad?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"God-damnit, don't you people get it?! I'm trying to get fired here! 
"
2,15,Randy,"I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore.
"
13,2,Cartman,"Oh. I uh... well I ah ah  I'm just... I'm just mad 'cause you should never use the term ""fag,"" Kyle. That's a hate word. And it's insensitive to butt pirates. Anyway, what do you think about the Coon, Stan and Kenny? Do you think he's the savior this town needs or do you think he's a dangerous vigilante?  Kenny?
"
16,6,Cartman,"This is Diet Double Dew Kyle! It only has half the caffeine and sugar of Double Dew.  Oh man, you guys, I gotta get to a bathroom fast.
"
1,5,Cartman,"It's okay Fluffy, I won't let them hurt you.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Ay! What the hell am I supposed to do with these things, huh?! Goddammit! 
"
3,12,Stan,"We've got to hide!
"
17,9,Kyle,"Cartman, Cartman! I heard that Stan somehow found out about our plan!
"
16,7,Kyle,"What happened? It just didn't work out?
"
15,5,Kyle,"I'm so happy! 
"
7,13,Stan,"Yup.
"
5,8,Stan,"No, Towelie, the entry code!
"
4,16,Cartman,"I don't know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom's last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven't seen him for three months.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Wow. Here we are, McNuggets. You're reached the big time. 
"
1,8,Stan,"No.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Uh huh.
"
3,2,Randy,"Well, let's see. If they combust... no. Could be from the... no.
"
8,6,Randy,"Oh yeah? What do you think, Mr. Jefferson? Do you think Kobe's guilty or innocent?
"
5,8,Stan,"A little more gas, Kenny. 
"
17,1,Butters,"Do you pledge allegiance to the Flag?!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Lying kicks ass!
"
6,9,Stan,"Those rams can do to us what they will, Mr. Lucas, but we'll never stop trying to protect films. 
"
10,14,Stan,"All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Please, Chef, if I don't get out of school and get my little brother back from the aliens, my parents are gonna disown me.
"
5,1,Cartman,"But... we can keep the Halo the Turtle dolls, right?
"
15,5,Cartman,"You knew about this??
"
10,14,Stan,"All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?!  All right, let's go win!
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--) 
"
2,18,Stan,"Really.
"
12,2,Randy,"Well, I think it's time for us to leave the poor girl alone. 
"
6,14,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay kids, I know the past few weeks have been really hard with the death of your teacher, Ms. Choksondik. 
"
13,13,Wendy,"Yeah, well, Butters peed on my house.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Shit! Butthole!  Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry.  Titties! Cock!  Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!
"
2,11,Cartman,"Oh, man, c'mon!
"
10,1,Stan,"You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. 
"
7,6,Kyle,"I think we can piece this case together now.
"
11,9,Stan,"All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2.
"
18,7,Butters,"I think there's somethin' supernatural goin' on. I asked my dad why I was being grounded, and he said that for asking him, that I was more grounded! It doesn't make sense!
"
13,8,Stan,"You're dead, Mr. Jackson!
"
2,12,Randy,"I didn't snap at you.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
6,17,Stan,"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Food! I have to have food! 
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Well, women want to read about ding-dongs! D'you think women care about the details of female anatomy?! Hell no! Women wanna read about big, powerful schlongs!  Look, I've seen women read these things. They skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis! That's what they want, so that's what I'm giving them!
"
4,9,Stan,"Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski.
"
16,2,Cartman,"How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.
"
10,6,Kyle,"Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.
"
1,12,Kyle,"Good! 
"
8,7,Stan,"Aw- awwww!
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Woooooh! Woooooh!) 
"
13,4,Cartman,"It's time for equality. We must give them the respect they deserve.
"
5,2,Stan,"When do we want it?
"
2,7,Cartman,"Hey you guys. Can we order a pizza?
"
6,3,Cartman,"Testicles and scrotum! 
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement.  Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?
"
18,9,Kyle,"I wanted to get Ike out of his room, so I invited all his friends over for a slumber party to play Dragon Age: Inquisition.
"
8,7,Stan,"What?!
"
4,6,Kenny,"(But I wanna play now!)
"
6,6,Cartman,"Okay, Craig, interesting choice. Powerful stuff there, Craig. Thank you very much. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Christ, he's like 50 years old!
"
6,6,Stan,"Shut up, fatass! 
"
5,1,Stan,"Where are you going, Kyle?
"
7,1,Kyle,"Kick it!
"
10,8,Cartman,"Don't worry, I have that covered.  Mom?
"
13,2,Stan,"Who's the Coon?
"
15,8,Stan,"No, because there's aliens with a sniper-chicken on me.
"
3,10,Kyle,"What?
"
10,4,Kyle,"Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
"
9,11,Cartman,"We're fine!
"
8,10,Stan,"What is that?
"
7,1,Cartman,"Oooo, very nice.
"
18,2,Randy,"Shuut up,  beer is bad for you?!
"
7,11,Cartman,"It's a cannibal! Stay back, cannibal! 
"
18,8,Randy,"All right, a hand for Detective Harris!  You know, if there's one thing I could leave you all with, it's this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals.  Sir? 
"
16,14,Cartman,"Thanks Mom,  I'll take that in the study. Do I have a study? I don't think I have a study. That's fine.
"
9,5,Kyle,"I can't believe it. I can't believe we have to keep on playing.
"
16,9,Cartman,"Out of the way. Out of the way please. 
"
17,7,Randy,"Is it really as bad as they say it is?
"
6,9,Cartman,"Dude, that's Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. 
"
1,7,Stan,"Dude, Kenny!
"
11,12,Kyle,"No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Oh wait! We forgot the necklace.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Sweet. How about Steve?
"
15,5,Cartman,"We started with two crack babies and a camera. Butters did all the Internet stuff. We've built up to a thousand hits a day.
"
12,4,Kyle,"They said we have to give them money that we make on the Internet.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"You think you can treat us however you want because we HAVE to fly! Well I'll tell you what, Sally Sassalot, I'm gonna come up with a NEW mode of transportation! A ahah brand new vehicle that'll put all you bastards out of business!
"
15,5,Cartman,"Look at the menu. Bacon inside pancakes, bacon meatloaf, they even have a bacon sundae for dessert.
"
13,1,Cartman,"""Jonas Brothers talk music, faith in God, and purity rings."" These Disney douche bags are the ones causing all this! 
"
4,11,Cartman,"Are you saying that what the Bible says isn't true?
"
7,6,Stan,"South Park Junior Detectives! We know you have Sarah Peterson's doll!
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"Hey uh, uh, uh. Good thing you guys came. This... little boy was trying to have his way with me.
"
7,9,Butters,"Well done!
"
12,9,Jimmy,"Yeah, nothing's changed. Our opinion of you can't possible go any lower.
"
9,11,Cartman,"That's it! You've got it!
"
8,7,Stan,"Okay, sorry, my bad, e-everyone back in the pile. 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
"
9,8,Randy,"Everyone below this line  will have to be evacuated to the south. Everyone above this line  is already dead. People like us in the middle states have to ride it out.  The balmy southwestern states  might have a chance but, New York  will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast.  What, Frank?!  Aw awww, Goddammit! 
"
17,9,Kyle,"You weren't playing fair, dude. Getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasn't fair.
"
3,2,Randy,"New girlfriend?
"
11,13,Butters,"Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
"
3,15,Cartman,"Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
"
11,2,Butters,"I'm bi-curious.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"To be in our club, not only do you have to be c-c-crippled, but you have to have been born that way. Do you know what that means? No butthole Superman asswipe Christopher Reeve!
"
4,9,Randy,"Well, maybe it's time.
"
13,10,Stan,"Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.
"
1,10,Kyle,"Yeah, that's weak!
"
6,13,Randy,"You wanna go watch?
"
13,4,Mr. Garrison,"They're just the same as you and me. Their rights must be preserrrr-r-r-rrrved.
"
1,1,Cartman,"Dude, weak mom.
"
5,4,Kyle,"'Cause, we're his friends.
"
1,4,Stan,"This kicks ass! I'm sorry I tried to change you Spark, I just didn't understand. 
"
9,13,Stan,"This rocket will fly to the moon?
"
3,13,Kyle,"Don't you ""Oh, brother"" me! She's the woman of my dreams!
"
8,5,Cartman,"You should split that money with AWESOM-O. After all, they were AWESOM-O's ideas.
"
9,6,Cartman,"It's just that, it's just that I got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin' to succeed that I... sometimes... took my family for granted!
"
7,12,Kyle,"What happened? 
"
2,4,Kyle,"Mom! Dad!
"
6,16,Butters,"Now you know my terrible secret!
"
13,6,Randy,"Uh, no.  We haven't seen anything.
"
16,4,Kyle,"Admit you're lying, and I'll let you go.
"
1,13,Stan,"Yyeah. We have a videotape that's in the finals for America's Stupidest Home Videos, and... if we win, we'll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.
"
7,5,Mr. Garrison,"Olay, children, let's take our seats. If you'll remember yesterday we were discussing state capitals.
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"No, but thanks for asking. 
"
11,13,Cartman,"Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!
"
11,10,Kyle,"You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!
"
12,13,Cartman,"You guys, I need to copy your math homework before class.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Uh. , Timmih Jimmih Jimmih Jim-  Jimmh Timmih Timmih Jimmih!
"
9,6,Cartman,"I took a crap in the principal's purse... seven times. Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey's Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics. I tried to have all the Jew exterminated last spring. Uhh, oh yeah, and there's this one kid whose parents I had killed and then made into chili which I fed to the kid.
"
9,14,Cartman,"Ichi banzai
"
2,18,Kyle,"Go, dude, go! 
"
1,13,Kyle,"How much do you think Mr. Mackey needs?
"
2,16,Cartman,"Hello, Mr. Hankey is appearing at the mall. Can somebody please take us?
"
10,9,Mr. Mackey,"But there must have been some motive. Nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason.
"
10,6,Cartman,"Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?
"
1,13,Kenny,"(Perhaps, he's just too big to get out of bed) 
"
7,8,Stan,"All right. Let's work it!  What the...?
"
8,3,Cartman,"Wir müssen die Juden ausrotten!! 
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago. And I was only a child.
"
18,8,Mr. Garrison,"All right kids, before we get started, the coach of the girls volleyball team is here and would like to say a few words. 
"
18,9,Kyle,"You know what I mean! Why is my little brother watching you talking about us talking about him?!
"
10,8,Kyle,"I can't. Just leave me behind.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean han.
"
1,11,Wendy,"Oh, hi, Kyle!
"
12,11,Stan,"We didn't lie, Craig, it was a sweet idea!
"
10,2,Butters,"Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away.
"
14,3,Stan,"Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer.
"
15,10,Kenny,"(I don't know.)
"
10,8,Kyle,"Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah! 
"
1,3,Cartman,"Okay, Mom.
"
2,17,Cartman,"I think my mom is a corporation.
"
11,2,Kyle,"The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
"
12,14,Butters,"Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh?
"
7,11,Cartman,"UUuuugh!! 
"
4,7,Cartman,"Hippies. Hi-i-ippies. They're everywhere. They wanna save the earth, but all they do is smoke pot and smell bad. He-elp! 
"
2,16,Stan,"Dude, is he here every year like this?
"
8,10,Cartman,"Shut up, Butters! We know what we're doing!
"
2,16,Kyle,"Yeah, they do!
"
10,8,Kyle,"That was such über pwnage
"
2,16,Kyle,"What's your mom doing here, dude?
"
12,1,Cartman,"Forget it, all right?! We'll use another airline! One that cares! 
"
8,11,Stan,"We have to appeal to all the students, so we, we need hot girls for the sixth graders...
"
18,9,Cartman,"That's Kyle the Jew again, talking about Call Of Duty to Stan.
"
6,17,Cartman,"I'm having a precious Christmastime moment, Kyle, if you don't mind.
"
7,15,Stan,"Oh well. Maybe we'll get to have a Christmas adventure next year. 
"
8,4,Kyle,"Yeah! Go Stan!
"
7,6,Kenny,"(Woohoo!!) 
"
11,4,Cartman,"President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?
"
9,6,Butters,"So... so it was just... it was... just my ima... magination then?
"
9,9,Stan,"All right, Butters, that's Heidi's house.
"
4,12,Kyle,"So can you do it?
"
10,12,Butters,"Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?
"
15,9,Cartman,"Scanning for Mexicans.  Oh!  We've got a Mexican! 
"
12,9,Cartman,"Wendy, I want to apologize, and um, tell you that-
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters, I had to!  Okay, I had to put it on the Internet!
"
5,1,Cartman,"Kyle, we've gotta get that sand out of your vagina. It's making you cranky. Does it itch?
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay! Mr. Hat, you need to let me talk to Mr. Garrison, m'kay?!
"
18,8,Cartman,"Guys, I think maybe Kenny's a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.
"
11,6,Kyle,"Really?
"
12,10,Stan,"Help you how?
"
4,11,Cartman,"My brain is of a much larger size than you guys's. I couldn't expect you to understand, not until you actually saw the cash flow!
"
3,14,Stan,"I'll go get my grandpa. He'll help us. Where's the Confederate Army now, Butters?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Wwwait. 
"
14,4,Cartman,"Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy...
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"I just want students to be able to make appointments to see the counselor, be able to see the school norse in the easiest, most streamlined fashion!
"
11,3,Cartman,"There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! 
"
3,16,Stan,"Let's have a cup o-Aaaa! 
"
15,1,Kyle,"We didn't read them!
"
5,1,Stan,"Aw, come, on dude! This is history.
"
9,12,Kyle,"So what should we do now? It's Saturday and we have to have as much fun as possible.
"
18,8,Stan,"Does an overseer have trample? DOES AN OVERSEER HAVE TRAMPLE?! 
"
1,7,Kyle,"If everyone is turned into zombies...
"
1,7,Kyle,"Chef!!! 
"
18,6,Kyle,"Who makes this crap?
"
3,11,Cartman,"K-kill me.
"
6,12,Stan,"Yeah. But what about Kenny. His soul is still in Cartman's body.
"
1,12,Cartman,"Hell, yeah I do, I got the triangle.I got the triangle, I got the triangle, dee dun dee dun
"
6,7,Stan,"Hey, what are you doing, man? Cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody. You've gotta come.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Why don't we just talk about the swastika?
"
8,11,Butters,"Hey, yeah. Uh why I could say I saw celebrities even though I didn't, a-a-and then lie about what I saw them doing.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Mom, I wanna go home!
"
12,1,Kyle,"Cartman has HIV?
"
4,16,Kyle,"Come on. Throw the football, Ike.
"
8,3,Stan,"Look, dude, we came a long way. We're not leaving until you give us our money.
"
11,14,Cartman,"Dude, Kyle. Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are.  Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive.  Kyle?
"
6,10,Kyle,"I can't wait to watch Terrance & Phillip with Bebe.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?
"
2,10,Kenny,"(Uh-huh.)
"
17,8,Butters,"We're not fans!
"
1,5,Stan,"Go where?
"
8,3,Stan,"Hi, uh, my friend and I just went to see The Passion.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Oh, Goddamnit!
"
16,14,Cartman,"Yes, we must show these to the public! For democracy's sake, right Kyle?
"
4,15,Cartman,"Aw, God-damnit!  LET ME OUT OF HMYA! 
"
16,6,Kyle,"Cool! Ziplining.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Ask the guys. There's six hospitals within a ten-mile radius, and all we do is pit the crack babies against each other with a little ball of crack.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Stupid assholes! 
"
1,1,Cartman,"Sure, you guys, what-ever. 
"
1,6,Stan,"You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted.
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children. Let's take our seats. We have something very important to discuss. Due to recent events around the country I've been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school.
"
7,10,Stan,"All right, check it out. Kenny did reconnaissance on the town. The old people have blockades here  and here . The old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter, and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the Mayor's office.
"
4,9,Stan,"Costumes? 
"
1,12,Stan,"Yeah, let us go!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Aw, Ma.
"
17,2,Stan,"It's true, dude. Maybe we just need to trust that our parents won't act out what they see. 
"
6,9,Cartman,"Just now -  1 2 3 dibs! 
"
4,4,Timmy,"G'oh livin' a lie, livin' a lie, Timmawh!
"
6,10,Stan,"Hoh!
"
15,10,Stan,"Shut up Butters! What we have to find out is who in the school is running Eavesdropper! I've done an extensive profile, and I've narrowed it down to somebody in this very room!  Now whoever you are, you're a gossiping little bitch!  And we're not gonna-!
"
9,1,Kyle,"Mom? Dad? What's a sex-change operation?
"
16,1,Cartman,"Mom, get the door! 
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Hmmm.
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay kids, let's take our seats, m'kay?  I know this has been a difficult couple o'weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay?
"
12,1,Stan,"Well, you know, you're always such a dick and stuff, and, and now...
"
1,3,Cartman,"Hey, you would taste my pee!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Yeah, check this one out. Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!
"
2,15,Stan,"Get to the stage! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Thanks!
"
6,6,Butters,"Oh, hey Dougie.  Oh I mean, my name is Professor Chaos.
"
18,6,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
8,7,Stan,"People from the future. Right, got it.
"
5,4,Stan,"What??
"
4,15,Stan,"That's so gross.
"
4,7,Stan,"Hey, Mr. Garrison. Where have you been?
"
10,4,Cartman,"I'll certainly do my best.  Ow.
"
11,10,Kyle,"Okay, that's enough.  Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this?  God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like ""I touched penises with my cousin!""  Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle.
"
3,16,Kyle,"I think Clyde is kind of cool, but Craig is definitely cooler than Clyde.
"
10,13,Cartman,"Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood.
"
2,6,Stan,"Well, what do you mean?
"
7,4,Cartman,"Oh yes! I am just about to flash back to the days of our Foundig Fathers!
"
8,3,Stan,"Dude. That movie sucked.
"
9,14,Stan,"Look, guys, about last night, can you just be quiet about it?
"
4,13,Kyle,"Not-- Aw, damnit..! 
"
6,14,Cartman,"Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! 
"
11,4,Stan,"Dude, we totally got let out of school.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Help? How can you help?
"
2,2,Kenny,"(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)
"
5,14,Stan,"Wow dude, your dad's a perv and your mom tried to kill you.
"
13,4,Stan,"What? 
"
2,18,Kyle,"Does so!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott.  Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA!  What a retard!  And now everyone saw it! 
"
10,1,Stan,"This isn't working.
"
13,14,Kyle,"You don't pee in the shower, dude, that's fucking disgusting!
"
3,2,Cartman,"Hey you guys, I am really pissed off now.
"
12,12,Stan,"Your little brother has climbed out of the window. I I think he's gonna jump!
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, muy bien. Señor Presidente, um... ¿Usted no ha visto el coro, no, mm-hm bien? (Oh fine, fine... You, uh, haven't seen the choir have you?)
"
16,14,Cartman,"""Warm nuts"", she said.
"
7,1,Kyle,"God Dammit!
"
1,1,Cartman,"He-yeah, that's what Kyle's little brother is all right!  Ow! 
"
8,6,Kyle,"What?
"
4,3,Randy,"Well...
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Nuh-now, who was that?  That is not appropriate behavior, m'kay?
"
12,7,Stan,"This is not the time for that!
"
6,13,Butters,"Ah I won't get scared, Mom. Promise!
"
2,12,Wendy,"I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Nothing!
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Oh dear, sounds like I'm gettin' fired. 
"
7,1,Kenny,"(Oh no!) 
"
6,14,Randy,"No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!
"
8,11,Cartman,"Ah, Token, can I have a quick word with you?  Look, Token, I-I know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you, but uh... Well the thing is, Token, we... we really need to revamp your whole TV persona.
"
8,5,Butters,"Yoe, you okay AWESOM-O?
"
6,7,Butters,"Waaaah!  Hay! Uh let me on! Let me on! 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Nnoo.
"
11,14,Cartman,"Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! 
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
9,11,Stan,"Maybe he'll actually learn a lesson this time. 
"
12,7,Stan,"I heard you all had some difficulty with a criminal getsin' out of your jail.
"
14,8,Butters,"Obama's fuckin' gay.
"
8,7,Randy,"That's our new housekeeper, Mrs.  Gruhd. She's gonna help around the house on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  And she'll do it for ten cents an hour.
"
9,4,Kenny,"(Hey, that's odd.)  (Hey, I'm floating. That can't be! Hey wait!) 
"
8,3,Kyle,"Dude, what's wrong with him?
"
17,1,Butters,"Oh, you can walk there. Trust me, you've gotta go to the DMV. It's incredible! See, I was like you once. Afraid, unsure, and doin' stuff I shouldn't do like showin' people pictures of little girls with their heads on fire. But you know what I've learned? That just goin' to the DMV, and letting go of all my wrongdoings, filled me with a joy I've felt nowhere else! Would you like to read some DMV literature?  This'll tell you most of what you need to know about the DMV. But just go. Everyone there is really nice. Your government is watching you and your government wants you to be happy. Have a nice day! 
"
4,8,Stan,"That was a good one.
"
2,15,Kyle,"What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!
"
18,1,Butters,"We already got a dollar!
"
10,9,Stan,"He was right. You DID cause 9/11.
"
7,4,Kyle,"Cartman?  Cartman??
"
2,17,Kyle,"Big corporations are good!
"
18,9,Kyle,"I know! But that doesn't matter any more! These kids don't wanna play the game, they just wanna watch people on YouTube play it. And you know why? Commentary.
"
17,5,Kyle,"What??
"
9,1,Mr. Garrison,"My whole life I've been a woman trapped in a man's body. A sex-change operation is my last chance at happiness.
"
16,9,Kyle,"Really? Thanks, dude! I'm gonna go get a video camera! 
"
12,7,Butters,"Huh you made me break one rule, I'm not breaking the other! It's all I have now.
"
1,9,Kyle,"I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew...
"
2,13,Cartman,"What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"There comes a time in every father's life when he must ask himself, ""How far will I go to save my son's life?""
"
1,13,Mr. Garrison,"...You don't count, Halfy-you don't have any legs!
"
2,8,Stan,"Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
"
7,10,Stan,"Dad, why is everyone letting old people do this? Why doesn't somebody stop them?
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. Eric, you wanna go next? 
"
5,13,Kyle,"'K go! 
"
12,10,Kyle,"This is awesome!
"
11,7,Randy,"Oh, now I feel bad.  Here!  Ahh!  Hahh!  Nono, that was really all the change I had.
"
3,3,Cartman,"I don't know, two!
"
14,1,Cartman,"Oh no!  Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?
"
1,8,Cartman,"Yeah. Here you get to eat all you want for only $6.99. That's why we all come here on Tuesday nights, except for Kenny's family 'cause to them $6.99 is two-years income.  Why is your family poor Starvin' Marvin? Is your dad an alcoholic too?  You see Starvin' Marvin, these are what we call appetizers.
"
18,2,Cartman,"Aunt Jemima. 
"
7,10,Cartman,"Calm down! We cannot understand you!
"
5,11,Kyle,"Well, Kyle, I I gotta go.
"
13,6,Randy,"That's ours, Mr. Alien. We are the Marshes, Randy and Stan.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Bring it on, queer bait.  Aaaahhhh, yes! 
"
11,6,Cartman,"They'll be done.  ¿Que paso? ¿Que paso?  All right, did you read the book?
"
2,4,Stan,"Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?
"
4,15,Kyle,"Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
"
10,8,Cartman,"I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?
"
11,14,Wendy,"Oh, but it doesn't matter. You took it too far!
"
4,13,Stan,"But isn't he only three years old?
"
15,7,Kyle,"Erm, okay, I know. How about we go to the mall?
"
2,17,Stan,"Do you know anything about corporate takeovers?
"
4,8,Kyle,"Yeah, we got it.
"
7,6,Stan,"Uh, sir, we just kinda got blind-sided by the-
"
12,7,Kenny,"(No, I'm partners with Craig) 
"
17,5,Kyle,"Hey Ike.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!
"
14,1,Kenny,"(Autoerotic asphyxiation? What's that?)
"
7,1,Stan,"Yeah, like we haven't heard that one a zillion times.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Owatta Beikoku! 
"
9,5,Randy,"Look, I get what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to realize that I have to fight him because it's who I am.
"
17,2,Randy,"No, what happened?
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Hello! Welcome, hmkay? This is already a wild party, hm.
"
5,7,Stan,"Dude, we gotta go get condoms quick.
"
16,1,Stan,"So what does that mean?
"
10,2,Cartman,"Who?
"
13,8,Kyle,"So what?!
"
9,10,Stan,"HA!
"
3,13,Kyle,"No, I think it's something you have to try a few times. Until you get it... right. 
"
15,8,Butters,"You mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole?
"
6,11,Stan,"Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ. 
"
7,15,Kyle,"It's been a week since Ike's been gone, and every day my parents seem worse. I have to try to go to Canada and speak with the new Canadian Prime Minister, but I can't do it alone.
"
10,10,Kyle,"He's a little young, don't you think?!
"
2,8,Stan,"Man, this sucks.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Turd sandwich.
"
12,8,Stan,"You bet, Indiana!  No!... Look out Indy, it's... Steven Spielberg and George Lucas!
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"Well, uh, ye, yes, I suppose you could.  You could, splice elephant genes with a dog, or cat, or a, pot-bellied pig genes.
"
5,8,Stan,"Alright, that does it! Brake angrily, Kenny!  Now listen, Towelie, we've just about had it with you!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Boys, are you paying attention?
"
8,10,Kyle,"We've gotta move away. We've gotta get as far away from this town as possible!
"
14,4,Randy,"Yahtzee!
"
18,2,Randy,"Staaan!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Chicken wings. 
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"I knew it! I knew gay people would never do this to their own kind! 
"
8,2,Jimmy,"S-s-s-ssseven!
"
7,13,Randy,"Yeah, because if you don't smoke, you can grow up to be-
"
4,8,Wendy,"I can't believe how right Bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody. As soon as it was over, all my feelings for you just vanished.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Dude, she's a chick!
"
12,1,Cartman,"What's that supposed to mean?!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Now look: I thnk the reason my soul is still here is because I need closure with all my friends and loved one. I can say my final goodbyes to them through you.
"
11,1,Stan,"Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"That's it. Gyration.  A gyroscope.  It would allow for maximum balance and yet... Mr. Hat! You're a genius!  It's so simple and yet genius!
"
4,4,Cartman,"You'll be inside of me...
"
6,14,Cartman,"I'm not fat, I have a different life choice.
"
15,2,Kyle,"Jimmy, you're got to explain to the Germans that this is your fault, not ours!
"
12,4,Cartman,"...You are a homo, Butters.
"
4,4,Kyle,"We all have Attention Deficit Disorder. So we all started taking Ritalin.
"
1,13,Cartman,"Thank you, Rumpertumskin. And what do you think about me, Clyde Frog?
"
3,4,Cartman,"You're gonna be eating those words, asshole.
"
3,4,Stan,"How much?
"
7,15,Stan,"All right dude, let's get the hell out of here!
"
3,17,Stan,"I have no idea.
"
16,6,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey!
"
10,1,Cartman,"All right! 
"
11,6,Kyle,"Dude, we're totally fucked now!
"
2,14,Stan,"You do?
"
5,10,Cartman,"Look at how the crap ...is sittin' right in the middle! 
"
7,15,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
4,9,Kyle,"So, all boy bands have five members.
"
14,5,Kyle,"Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
"
5,2,Butters,"Yeah, well, he's the coolest kid with disabilities in the world!
"
8,6,Stan,"Be cool, dude. I, I think maybe he's a burn victim or something.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Uh not from you dumbasses, that's for sure.
"
9,11,Kyle,"Hey. Wuh I'm giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?
"
10,10,Kyle,"No! Ike, don't do it!
"
9,8,Stan,"Man, I wish I could really drive this thing.
"
14,9,Randy,"More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey.
"
3,2,Cartman,"Well, I guess you guys can do the Stations of the Cross by yourselves. 
"
16,2,Cartman,"Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there.
"
8,1,Stan,"What?!
"
6,13,Kyle,"You guys. Somebody is following us.
"
10,8,Kyle,"Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts.
"
3,13,Cartman,"What?! What the fuck that that mean?
"
6,2,Randy,"Sounds good to me; let's go this weekend!
"
1,1,Stan,"They took him on their ship.
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Yeah! Yeeaahh!)
"
6,5,Butters,"Huh uh hurry! Hurry! Hurry! 
"
5,9,Cartman,"Aw, son of a bitch!
"
6,9,Kyle,"""Free hat?""
"
6,12,Stan,"Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we're not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we're done. 
"
11,7,Stan,"Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle.
"
3,8,Mr. Garrison,"That's great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that?
"
12,9,Wendy,"You fucking suck so hard!!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Yeah! You suck, Cartman! 
"
8,13,Kyle,"No, don't you see? Cartman never had psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There's a logical explanation for every psychic story you've ever heard.
"
2,7,Stan,"Hey, look!
"
6,1,Butters,"Everything's getting dark...
"
16,13,Kyle,"Dude, the sooner you eat your peas, the sooner you can try to win some of your friends back. Eh ya you need to Bill Clinton this.
"
2,7,Kenny,"(Oh, yeah)
"
3,12,Cartman,"God, I hate you guys!
"
3,16,Kenny,"(And mine too.)
"
4,9,Randy,"What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
"
16,13,Stan,"Wow! You know, whatever it takes, Butters. People are aware of the problems in Belarus; maybe I did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Alright, I'll start. I'll kick you in the nuts, Kenny! 
"
1,1,Kyle,"Now do you believe us, Cartman?
"
7,3,Stan,"They say they got the guy that did it down at the police station.
"
5,4,Cartman,"O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?
"
4,11,Cartman,"It all came to me days ago, when we were first in Sunday school.
"
10,7,Mr. Mackey,"Mrs. Cartman, we have had it with your son's behavior, mkay?! Little Billy Turner is now being treated at the hospital!
"
6,6,Butters,"Well, but ah I can get better.
"
12,4,Stan,"Boy, I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Cartman, he's crazy!
"
7,2,Butters,"You know, Christopher Reeve, the guy who played Superman.
"
6,12,Kenny,"(Okay.) 
"
5,10,Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever?
"
13,1,Stan,"You want your Grey's Anatomy back, Kenny?
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Awesome! Do you have a turkey that can do tricks?
"
5,8,Kyle,"If we can go in, and get the GameSphere in 30 minutes, we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!
"
1,7,Cartman,"I can't, I have to win those two tons of candy.
"
1,12,Cartman,"No! I found it, he stole it!
"
6,8,Kyle,"Why would he put anything in your butts?
"
16,7,Cartman,"No no.  Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you've gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.
"
5,10,Kyle,"Hohly crahap, duhude, heh!
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Penis or vagina, right. Oral sex, m'kay.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Argh! That's just so untrue.)
"
14,8,Cartman,"Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left.  Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang!
"
13,14,Stan,"Not today... yet.
"
14,6,Stan,"Yeah dude, we, we know what it means.
"
5,1,Cartman,"Goddamn it, Kenny! Don't get your plague germs on me!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Dude, he just goes around imposing his will on people. He's my idol. 
"
8,9,Stan,"Dad, you're a geologist!
"
1,8,Mr. Garrison,"Okay kids, that's enough Dickens for one day. Let's get on with our lesson, right Mr. Hat?
"
18,5,Cartman,"Your dad has a fucking drone?
"
1,10,Cartman,"Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Sure, come on up here, Tim-Tim.  Timmy, ladies and gentlemen. Let's give him a hand, very much. Come to think of it, give him a pair of legs, too.  Here, Timmy, put on this silly hat.  Just for a second, Timmy.  Don't be a jerk, Timmy.  Hey, don't push me!
"
18,5,Butters,"It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever's controlling it. And it can take video the entire time right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.
"
5,8,Stan,"Ohmigod, look! 
"
14,3,Cartman,"Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!
"
18,1,Cartman,"Fuck you! Fuck you, everyone. Yes, fuck you all, thanks!  How do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace? As you know, our goal at Washington Redskins is to not do anything, and make money not doing it.
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Hoarding? M'kay, what's that?
"
12,2,Randy,"An incredible harvest. Some of the best corn I've seen in years.
"
5,5,Kyle,"What??
"
6,16,Stan,"Four months?? And you never told anybody that you were living with yourself in the future??
"
2,17,Kyle,"Will you stop with the underpants gnomes, Tweek?! We have to work here!  
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah. We're having him resurrurected.
"
13,7,Butters,"And our parents hollered at us!
"
6,13,Stan,"Jimmy didn't stop them!
"
4,7,Cartman,"Oh, I think I see where this is going. 
"
13,1,Stan,"Dude, what the hell are you doing, Kenny?! This is the day we were supposed to throw cow turds at cars together!
"
6,3,Butters,"Aw. hamburgers, this just keeps on gettin' worse. 
"
10,2,Stan,"We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now
"
16,10,Randy,"And then I had to drive to Walgreens, Barnes & Noble AND Ace Hardware. I tell you, having to go around and buy stuff again sucks.
"
8,10,Butters,"Hah! 
"
18,3,Butters,"I think someone's in there.
"
14,7,Jimmy,"Nathan, your team put up an amazing fight. And even though I was crowned the King of Cripple Camp, I want you to know that you were the real ch-cha, champ.
"
3,8,Butters,"Dougie pushed that big box out of the way and found this old ventilation duct. And I reckon it's got to lead somewhere, and and it's good 'cause, uh 'cause now we won't drown.
"
6,4,Kyle,"We didn't realize hunger made you feel so bad.
"
6,8,Kyle,"So?
"
10,11,Cartman,"Oh my God. I crapped my pants.  You guys, I crapped my pants!  Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Eh- Aaaaah. Ooooo-ah. Uuuuu aaaaa.
"
2,9,Kyle,"I'm poopies, ma!
"
18,2,Stan,"Yeah. You remember you said that Lorde, the singer, her uncle worked with you?
"
8,6,Cartman,"Yeah way, Craig! And if you don't believe in Mr. Jefferson, then you can just not come!
"
15,5,Cartman,"A hot tub full of KFC gravy, Kyle. Did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime?  Kyle, as owners of this company, we owe it not only to ourselves, but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible. McDonald's French fries and KFC gravy. The French call this ""poutaine"".
"
7,6,Cartman,"Bash, bash, BASH your skull in, causing instant death. 
"
8,1,Kyle,"No dude, we can't go around showing our weapons to people. Our parents'll find out we have them.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
3,12,Kyle,"Naww, let's dig up somebody else.
"
4,13,Cartman,"He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
"
16,6,Stan,"Kyle! 
"
8,6,Stan,"Blanket, you in here?
"
14,8,Kyle,"I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!
"
2,7,Mr. Garrison,"See, I told ya. 
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Well we gave them the 15 billion dollar bailout and they fired their employees anyway! So now we have three people to clear 400 passengers!
"
7,11,Stan,"Dude, it's Kyle's birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.
"
17,9,Kyle,"Wait a minute. Ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here?
"
6,16,Butters,"Hwuhh. That'll make them awful sore.
"
10,6,Kenny,"(Yeah, I don't get it.)
"
9,3,Kyle,"Damn, CAA is pretty impressive.
"
7,7,Randy,"How's it goin', Gerald?
"
10,10,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher? 
"
1,12,Cartman,"I found a magic triangle, and this greedy son of a bitch took it from me!
"
1,7,Cartman,"There, you see? All of a sudden, my costume is pretty badass, huh?
"
16,5,Butters,"Yes...
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Okay.  Now, uh, as your counselor, I'm here to tell you about drugs and alcohol and why they're bad, m'kay? Uh, so, first of all, uh, smokin's bad.  You shouldn't smoke. And-uh, alcohol is bad.  You shouldn't drink alcohol. And-uh, as for drugs, well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Okay, that about wraps up my introduction, now uh, are there any questions?  Yes, Stan?
"
6,12,Kyle,"Man, I can't believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back.
"
9,8,Randy,"Come on, hurry! 
"
10,14,Stan,"Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-
"
5,8,Kyle,"Where the hell is it??
"
7,12,Mr. Garrison,"Very good, Gary. Wow, looks like I don't have a class full of retards anymore, doesn't it, children? 
"
12,13,Kyle,"We promised each other we would never do that, remember?
"
10,6,Stan,"Maybe there's another way out of here.
"
11,7,Kenny,"(Yehes!)
"
11,13,Stan,"What, you mean, Kyle?
"
8,2,Jimmy,"You did a great job in the 500, Timmy. You're really im-p-p-proving.
"
10,10,Cartman,"Freeze, bitch!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Stan, I don't like Wendy.  All I cared about was getting an A in this stupid project!
"
10,10,Cartman,"Here, you need a smoke, brah?
"
4,15,Cartman,"Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed! 
"
5,3,Kyle,"Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. 
"
7,9,Cartman,"God dammit! 
"
18,3,Mr. Garrison,"Saying ""normal"" is extremely offensive to people who aren't in that group.  Trust me, you don't want this hot potato! Just let him use the girls room!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Lisa Berger asked you out and you called her fat?! Do you have any idea how you made her feel?! She's a really nice girl!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Oh, but I'm not buying the park to get people to come.
"
9,2,Randy,"You got a better ides, Steven?! Dammit, my son is in there!
"
3,3,Cartman,"Okay. 
"
4,9,Cartman,"But we have to perform!
"
7,14,Stan,"Football.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Please welcome your host, Jimmy Valmer. 
"
12,10,Randy,"That's the TV in our living room, still showing commercials right now.  What do you think about the television, Shelly?  Oh, the news is starting! 
"
18,8,Wendy,"Yeah, I heard the girls volleyball team won by like 20 points.
"
1,5,Stan,"Oh, neither.  It's my sister.
"
14,11,Cartman,"I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"Do what?
"
8,11,Cartman,"Aww! Ohh! God, I just got so sleepy. I'm sorry, what were we talking about?
"
1,7,Wendy,"Aaah!
"
5,3,Butters,"And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
"
7,14,Butters,"Hi. Is Lexus there, please? This is her boyfriend. 
"
7,4,Cartman,"Well you know, it's a...  H-ho, awesome! 'Look at me, I'm back in time, in 1776.'With gaslight corners, cobblestone streets, and humble houses made of bricks.'What a special magic time, and it's all alive for me'I'm so glad Stan and Kyle aren't here. I hate those guys, seriously.'Seriously hate those guys. Hate Stan and Kyle.
"
6,15,Kyle,"There's four white birds!  This is what Grandma wants? She wants me to attend Jewleeard.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Aw, just a few more things.
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"""Current Events in South Park"". Now, I want you all to read a newspaper, or better yet, watch television, and come up with something current in South Park to do a report on.
"
15,1,Kyle,"Aw, that's just a rumor. They don't really track y- 
"
14,2,Cartman,"Motherfucker!  The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, ""alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming,"" and then after like a hundred pages I was like ""alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end,"" and then I got to the last page, and I was all ""the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!""
"
9,9,Butters,"Uh hello, I'm Butters.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Mom, you said nothing would go wrong!
"
3,2,Cartman,"Hello-o.
"
6,5,Stan,"We're going to Kyle's house to watch! Come on! 
"
2,18,Stan,"Watch my coat, dude.
"
18,8,Kyle,"Got what?
"
2,7,Kyle,"We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days. 
"
15,5,Stan,"Maybe. Or maybe we haven't been told such a big fib after all.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Hurray!
"
7,14,Butters,"What's Raisins?
"
3,10,Cartman,"C'mon!
"
10,6,Cartman,"All that treasure.  It's all mine!  So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it!  You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys!  Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass!  Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. 
"
8,8,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
17,1,Cartman,"Uhh, that us, uhh, yo-you must have a pretty big file on Eric Cartman. All his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time.
"
8,14,Stan,"Right, whatever.  I'm taking down the manger I built.  Ah!  Aaaah!  Aagh! Aaaahh!  AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! 
"
3,7,Cartman,"God damnit, Kitty, you have to calm down! Here, I'll get you some catnip. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?
"
14,2,Cartman,"...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
"
16,4,Butters,"Yeah, well it was the closest place to hide.
"
6,12,Randy,"Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??
"
11,2,Kyle,"Hrrugh! 
"
6,7,Kyle,"Nuh uh.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Yeah. Poor grandma...
"
3,8,Stan,"Alright, alright. Here's your mission. In ten minutes this room is gonna fill up with water and drown everybody. You have to find me a way out of this room, fast.
"
15,5,Kyle,"But this video game can make a million dollars. We have to give the crack babies a piece of that.
"
6,5,Stan,"What?
"
10,4,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"You will be! You will be!  You will be.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Aw, crap!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Ehey hey, how's it going bros? This is CartmaaanBrah! And it looks like we're in the producer's office in Los Angeles now. 
"
1,1,Cartman,"Hah, hah. Mr. Hat yelled at you.  Ow! My ass! 
"
4,10,Stan,"We have a question.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Alright, fine! Here!  Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! 
"
14,2,Kenny,"(No, No, Scrotie McBoogerballs)
"
4,1,Kyle,"Yeah. Okay, get over here, Clyde.
"
12,12,Kyle,"Ike, don't do it! There's still so much to live for!  I know you really wanted McCain to win but, but it's going to be okay.  No, that's not true, Ike. The economy could easily stabilize with Obama's plan.  Ike, don't jump! You could really hurt your ankle or something.  Really Ike, that's like five feet off the ground. Don't do it.
"
4,14,Kyle,"Okay!
"
10,9,Kyle,"Will you shut up about 9/11!
"
8,3,Stan,"Come on, Kenny, we're going to Malibu!
"
1,10,Stan,"Well, come on. We we have to at least see the weigh-in.
"
10,10,Cartman,"I found this in the hallway.  Apparently your student Ike has a crush on you.  You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ. Here you go. 
"
5,3,Kyle,"My potential hasn't even been reached.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
8,3,Stan,"No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that's cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.
"
8,8,Stan,"Dude, so my vote didn't even really matter!
"
13,6,Randy,"Will you relax, Stan? 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Hahah. Very funny, you guys, hahah. 
"
10,4,Cartman,"You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!
"
3,11,Stan,"Maybe we'll come and visit sometime.
"
4,9,Butters,"Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head
Down came a white angel and she said
""Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head""
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF
Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest
Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped 'im on the head
"
15,10,Cartman,"You okay, Jenny?
"
2,10,Mr. Garrison,"And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?  Yes, Kyle?
"
18,3,Randy,"You wanted to see me, boss?
"
15,7,Stan,"Oh thanks, dude.
"
17,1,Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, the government thinks they can do whatever they want, and we don't have any privacy anymore!  Just between you and me, I think everyone is too stupid to see what this is all leading to. Did you guys read ""1984""?
"
1,1,Mr. Garrison,"I don't know, Kyle. Did you ask Mr. Hat?
"
13,3,Randy,"Uh there's about seventeen thousand dollars' worth here.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Aaaaaah!  Huhh, ohh, 
"
12,8,Cartman,"Ah yes, herro prease.  We are Chinese peopull.
"
2,13,Kyle,"What do you mean?
"
13,13,Butters,"She's speechless!
"
1,1,Stan,"That's uummm... a hamburger from... that's from, like, two days ago.
"
15,8,Stan,"The rock creatures?
"
15,7,Stan,"Why didn't you tell me? I wanna go to the movies.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Kyle, open your eyes, man!
"
11,8,Cartman,"I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?
"
12,4,Cartman,"Dude, screw you. Your Internet thing was so last year.
"
15,7,Stan,"I know, Mom. I love you too.
"
18,2,Cartman,"How's it going, everybody?
"
11,3,Cartman,"If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!
"
17,8,Butters,"Uh what's the matter, Scott?
"
2,16,Kyle,"Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
"
10,9,Kyle,"Who the fuck are you?!
"
11,1,Cartman,"Oh shit here we go!  It's on! Race war!  Race war! Race war!  Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! 
"
11,10,Kyle,"Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!
"
9,4,Cartman,"Uh, my friend Kenny was saving my place in line.
"
1,13,Cartman,"You know how my friend Stan, has... a dad?
"
13,4,Randy,"Heh, yeah?
"
8,5,Butters,"How come?
"
13,14,Kyle,"Blow it out your ass, Cartman! 
"
17,9,Kyle,"Well what the hell are you doing?! This isn't gonna work now!
"
1,12,Stan,"Whoa, dude!
"
5,6,Kyle,"Ah! Ow! Hey, it hurts!  Owie-ow! Help! Ow, that hurts!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Okay, okay.  Ohh, double psych!
"
15,7,Cartman,"Oh, ask him about the murder now, Kyle.
"
8,2,Cartman,"What?! 
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, you're drunk! You're not driving a car!
"
4,6,Cartman,"What the hell just happened?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(I don't care. I've gotta get some protection.)
"
4,15,Kyle,"I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
"
16,11,Stan,"Hawaii?
"
2,10,Cartman,"Puh! I heard that.
"
12,8,Kyle,"I love you too.
"
6,2,Stan,"Pizza... pizza... pizza...
"
10,3,Cartman,"Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, it feels really good!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Dude, when my mom finds out that my babysitters have their boyfriends over, she mostly gets really mad, mostly.  Yaaah. Eeyy! Ey, God damnit!
"
4,6,Kyle,"Dude. You have sex with children.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Yeah. She is.
"
7,7,Randy,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm down three hundred bucks.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Fuck you! Why would they send you in to convince me of anything?!
"
18,3,Stan,"Wow, this is is pretty nice. 
Feelin' good on a Monday.
Got my space, all the freedom I need.
Yah yah yah
By myself, yah yah yah
"
5,8,Cartman,"No it isn't.
"
16,2,Cartman,"That's right.  Guys with Cash For gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals Gold. 
"
1,10,Kyle,"Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.
"
2,16,Stan,"Dude, I thought Mr. Hankey lived in the sewer. What's he doing in Nebraska?
"
12,13,Jimmy,"M-Maybe you should just talk to her. You know, a little conversation. Tell her... what you feel. Sometimes you feel like there's a b-burnin' inside you, like a-
"
15,11,Randy,"What brah?!
"
12,7,Stan,"Wendy, I have to do something. Please look away. 
"
12,7,Butters,"That looks dangerous.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Nu-no, she doesn't. She told me she doesn't wanna fight. She's just stuck, Stan. Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids are gonna call her a chicken.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Weh-well, why didn't you tell anybody?
"
15,13,Cartman,"Did you guys know that when you stop menstruating it's called menopause?
"
15,7,Stan,"How can people say this game is cool? It doesn't even matter what choices you make.
"
6,8,Kyle,"Get up, fat boy! I'm gonna kick your ass!
"
3,2,Kyle,"(Dude, I think you pooed a lot.)
"
3,4,Cartman,"Five bucks.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Hey! Whoooa.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say ""hella.""
"
5,8,Cartman,"You just have no long-term memory 'cause you get high all the time!
"
8,9,Stan,"Save it, Grandpa!
"
4,13,Kyle,"I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Awesome. 
"
13,12,Cartman,"Hey, hey yeah. Then people would be free to call Harley riders fags all over the country.
"
8,14,Stan,"The lion cubs!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Wow, what a great audience. I just flew into South Park. Boy, are my crutches tired!  What a terrific audience. You know, sometimes people ask me, ""Are you angry at God for making disabled people?"" I say, ""No, I think the world is better with puh-President Bush."" 
"
7,1,Stan,"I like it.
"
1,12,Stan,"What is it?
"
16,2,Stan,"Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa!  No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! 
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, you like to drink. So have a drink once in a while. Have two. If you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like, then that thing still controls your life and, 'n you've never learned any discipline at all.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!
"
1,9,Kyle,"Well sure.
"
2,17,Stan,"Perhaps there is no stopping the corporate machine.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Yeah, I've been working out... r-really hard.
"
16,12,Randy,"And some gifts for the kids too. After all, we're rich now.
"
13,6,Stan,"Tells?
"
6,7,Butters,"General Disarray, are your parents home?
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig!
"
3,4,Kyle,"We'll see!
"
7,7,Cartman,"Well, you shouldn't be such a dick, dude. 
"
14,9,Cartman,"Come on, you guys, hurry!
"
13,13,Cartman,"Wait, hold on, can we take a break?
"
2,4,Kyle,"They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses.
"
9,5,Randy,"You want me to kick your ass right here?! 
"
3,16,Stan,"No. And uh, that's why he sent me here; 'cause he's too embarrassed to come himself.
"
7,12,Randy,"Well, look, my kid was just over at your house and he a-
"
9,9,Cartman,"Working on what?! Your dance moves?!
"
10,2,Stan,"I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uuuuuugh! 
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Look, I want to return this orange bracelet, m'kay?!  It's worthless now!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Two hundred and thirty dollars?? I just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium! 
"
3,10,Kyle,"Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?
"
13,9,Stan,"Butters, you're the one doing all this?
"
15,7,Kyle,"Hey, Stan. What did the doctor say?
"
7,10,Kyle,"Aah! There's another one!
"
14,9,Randy,"Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!
"
1,12,Cartman,"Well, you can tell Kyle that he's a dirty goddam son of a bitch!!
"
8,1,Kyle,"God? Please, if you get me out of this, I swear, I will never play with weapons ever again.
"
1,11,Kyle,"Well that goes without saying, fatass, how could she help but look at you!
"
1,12,Kyle,"The Diamond of Pantheos.  She must be powerless now.
"
4,3,Kyle,"Those contorting Romanian chicks rule.
"
10,12,Butters,"Wait!  It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!
"
2,6,Kyle,"'Cause old ladies are fat and you are, too!
"
18,2,Kyle,"Doesn't anyone understand the significance of ""I'm sorry"" anymore?
"
1,10,Stan,"Dude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Why do people have to keep reminding us of what we don't have?!
"
14,8,Cartman,"I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters,  Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih! Timmih, Jimmih!  Arrrh Timmih!  Jimmih!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Don't fail us! We'll be right there!
"
2,4,Kyle,"Put him down, you stupid dog!
"
2,12,Cartman,"Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Thank you, Stan.  Sh sh, here they come, here they come.  ""And so I said, 'That's a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.'"" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"No no, I was the asshole. 
"
1,11,Cartman,"She wasn't looking at you, buttlord, she was looking at me!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Hey! What's going on? What is that? 
"
7,5,Cartman,"Please, you guys. It's like, I can't even have a moment to myself anymore. See? 
"
10,3,Randy,"STAAAN!!
"
4,10,Stan,"Bo-ring.
"
1,6,Kyle,"Why is Death coming after us?
"
3,10,Cartman,"The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.
"
9,14,Randy,"I can't! I'm sick!  It's not fair! Why did you give me this disease?!  Stan! Stan!  Stan.
"
14,5,Stan,"Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge.
"
16,8,Mr. Mackey,"Huh. You you think the students would like that?
"
7,6,Stan,"Nothing, he just told us a bunch of stuff.
"
7,3,Kenny,"(Yeah, how the fuck is that?!)
"
5,2,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
11,9,Randy,"That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe. 
"
2,15,Stan,"Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease.
"
5,3,Stan,"Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second.  Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!
"
3,5,Cartman,"No! No. Don't.
"
14,14,Stan,"That's stupid, Cartman.
"
11,7,Cartman,"You what?!
"
6,15,Kyle,"He's not a douche! He talked to my grandma!
"
17,8,Butters,"OOAH! Uh, sir, you said pizzas were coming!
"
3,4,Wendy,"Yeah. Christ, I could have been home by now!
"
12,2,Kyle,"I'm not Britney Spears, all right?!
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Stan! Hey Stan, can I talk to you?  Listen, Stan, ah I just wanna tell you... You've really been an inspiration m'kay?
"
9,2,Stan,"What? You mean, we're stuck here listening to this crap? 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Jesus Christ!
"
16,7,Butters,"Fellas! Fellas! Fellas!  AAAAH, Fellas!
"
8,1,Randy,"What happened to him?
"
6,9,Kyle,"Yah.
"
10,2,Mr. Mackey,"But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay?
"
1,1,Kyle,"Ike!
"
13,6,Randy,"Hey, the right paint job is a big part of what makes a Pinewood Derby car go fast!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Dude, maybe we don't have to rip a tooth out of Kenny's mouth.
"
13,10,Cartman,"The Rad Russian.
"
7,4,Kyle,"Cartman? You'd better be studying, God-damnit! 
"
2,12,Randy,"Oh, maybe it was.
"
8,6,Randy,"Wow, I'm gonna go buy that new sport coat I've been wanting. 
"
7,9,Kyle,"He beat us. Because all this time we've been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up.  I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and  I'm psyched!
"
3,11,Stan,"Wow!
"
15,3,Kyle,"Oh no, dental floss, what will I do?
"
9,3,Stan,"Ah Kenny, Token just signed with us!
"
12,4,Kyle,"There aren't gonna be new shows! Don't you get it?! Terrance and Phillip are Canadian! We have to get Canada to end this strike!
"
6,12,Randy,"The boys wanna see their dead friend Kenny again, Jimbo, so they're... building a ladder to heaven.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Ah ah ah, ah, I know what you're thinking, Stan. You're thinking, you're gonna go tell Kyle. Look, I know you think he's your best friend, but Kyle is a Jew rat! He has his Jew ethics while he hoards his greedy Jew gold, and he will Jew you out if you tell him about this!
"
11,6,Cartman,"All right, did you write the four essays?
"
8,5,Butters,"Whoa...
"
15,2,Cartman,"Stop it now! Ugh-  No use, guys. He's got some sort of defense mechanism.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Yes it is a big deal! Why do you think everyone washes their hands after they go to the bathroom?!
"
12,6,Kyle,"Where... is... the Internet?
"
18,5,Cartman,"Whooaa! 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Holy shit!
"
13,13,Butters,"Whoa... 
"
2,4,Kyle,"There, what do you think?
"
11,4,Kyle,"So then maybe you're wrong.
"
8,11,Butters,"Well, how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us?
"
2,11,Stan,"Mr. Mackey!
"
11,11,Kyle,"Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-
"
6,1,Cartman,"Shu- shut up you guys, shut up you guys. 
"
13,11,Kenny,"(Yeah, me neither.)
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Hunh?
"
9,6,Cartman,"What else do I have to do?!
"
7,10,Mr. Garrison,"Look out!! 
"
9,9,Butters,"You don't know how hard it is to be me. 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana.  Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell,  so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on,  and when it gets back up to me,  we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you…
"
4,15,Cartman,"What?!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"No. Actually, I'm a stand-up comic.
"
6,7,Cartman,"What's your name?
"
17,10,Butters,"Oh no you don't, Wendy! You're not trappin' me inside the computer lab to beat me up!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Right. I guess I learned today that sometimes you-
"
12,9,Butters,"Fuck him up, Wendy!
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yeah! What the hell were we thinking?! Boooooo!
"
6,13,Randy,"Uh... Chris, are the boys over here?
"
18,9,Stan,"Tell me about it.
"
5,7,Stan,"Yeah, we need condoms!
"
11,13,Kyle,"I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself.
"
13,4,Kyle,"It was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Kyle?
"
1,2,Stan,"What's that stuff?
"
1,9,Kyle,"Wait!  I may not have Santa, but I do have Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
"
14,4,Cartman,"Surprise! 
"
2,4,Kenny,"(Ooh, the penis!)
"
6,16,Cartman,"Okay, okay, fine. I I just, I just, ...my first idea. That's why we have these consultations.  Okay, okay, lemme, lemme see here. Uh. Oh wait, oh this is nice. How about this: uh, we'll lure your parents out of the house, and then we'll kill them. Uh, we'll cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog
"
13,4,Randy,"Th-that's not the same! We've got the Chinese Firecracker! 
"
11,10,Cartman,"Thank you Your Honor. This isn't a victory for me, this is a victory for the justice system. And my balls.
"
3,3,Kenny,"(And then we gotta go down and get a piece of paper and write down each one of the words we sang on the tape deck. And then, sing it back again!)
"
11,2,Butters,"Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, Jimmy Valmer! Oh, okay, what about him?
"
18,2,Cartman,"What do you mean? We're just... going to school.
"
6,5,Kyle,"You'd miss the new trailer?
"
3,4,Stan,"Dude. Craig chooses you. He wants to fight.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Well, wha-what do I do?
"
2,9,Cartman,"No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding.
"
8,7,Stan,"Can you speak in present-day English please?
"
2,14,Stan,"Wait! Wait! What are you doing?
"
15,9,Cartman,"A Baptist priest with a huge boner walks into a bar...
"
12,13,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, what's going on here, Mr. Gueermo?
"
5,12,Kyle,"Come on, Nurse Token. We're gonna play football, you puss.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Yeah, you're still fat!
"
10,3,Cartman,"Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?
"
14,14,Randy,"Whoa, are you serious??  Yes, yes!
"
18,6,Stan,"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be okay. 
"
13,12,Stan,"Yeah, we did that!
"
8,12,Wendy,"Yes.
"
6,7,Butters,"Well ah, that's good. Good luck being their new friend, Tweek. I hope you'll do better than me. Well, see ya fellas. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Okay. 
"
17,9,Stan,"Did Kyle know about this?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Get back on, fatass! You have to practice!
"
18,7,Kyle,"Yes. My name is Kyle Broflovski. Can you tell me if I purchased an Oculus Rift headset there?
"
2,18,Stan,"He doesn't look very happy in there.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Dude, that mom is kewl. 
"
15,11,Randy,"Must be... a pretty hot and steamy show. What's it called?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm just hangin' out with Token. Did you know that if it wasn't for African-Americans, we wouldn't have Rock & Roll? So cool that we have a black President.  About time. 
"
17,10,Cartman,"Did you not see Erica Smith's boobs, Kyle? They're like perfect water balloons.
"
13,14,Randy,"Give me the banana.  Ugh. Awgh. Aaagh! Awwwwgh! Awwgh, wagh.  Aww, ooogh, Aaaaaaaah.
"
16,14,Butters,"At Red Robster. 
"
9,11,Kyle,"What?!
"
16,14,Stan,"Oh, Red Lobster.
"
4,13,Stan,"Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!
"
16,13,Butters,"Ooo, look at him go, Stanning his ground!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Oh, you're most certainly welcome.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Okay, Cartman, what do you want?
"
16,13,Butters,"Prostitute!
"
4,14,Kyle,"So wait. Do we do that spin-around thing on the last beat?
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
2,13,Stan,"Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"I'll tell you one thing: their food hasn't been getting along with my stomach for years.
"
8,9,Randy,"Boys, these axes are only four ninety-nine.
"
7,3,Cartman,"I didn't feel bad before, but now I just feel terrible.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh, fuck my ass again! 
"
17,1,Butters,"Oh, you shouldn't be handing out drawings like that, ma'am. Uh, don't you know that the government is watching you?
"
6,2,Stan,"That does it! I'm calling the police! 
"
15,10,Wendy,"Of course. A kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Yeah they fucking did Kyle!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Yeah, bumper cars, sweeet! 
"
6,10,Stan,"Is Bebe home?
"
8,3,Kyle,"He does not!
"
6,10,Cartman,"Now, just yell ""Put the lotion in the fucking basket!""
"
15,7,Kyle,"That's it, Stan! I'm not sitting through a whole movie with you! 
"
3,2,Cartman,"Get me down from here!
"
13,10,Kyle,"Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.
"
2,18,Stan,"This guy rules!
"
1,9,Cartman,"Is this some kind of Jewish tradition?
"
7,15,Kyle,"You're not gonna die, Kenny. Don't be stupid.
"
10,7,Butters,"No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Thank you. 
"
6,12,Cartman,"I can't live like this. I, I have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body.
"
1,10,Mr. Garrison,"Holy poop on a stick!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Yes Ma'am. 
"
5,7,Kyle,"What the hell is wrong with them? 
"
12,1,Cartman,"We're not just sure, we're HIV-positive.
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh, boy! This thing ain't never gonna stop! I must be all the way down to Denver by now.  Ohhh, whoopee! Finally. Uh now that the car has come to a stop, it's safe for me to unfasten my seat belt.  Boy, Mom must be- worried sick about- me right now. Ah I gotta get back home.  Wuh gee whiz, where the heck am I?
"
6,17,Kyle,"But how are we gonna get to the North Pole?
"
4,10,Butters,"Uhwell, uhwhat are we eatin' then?
"
6,1,Cartman,"That guy ate all the sandwiches he wanted and lost weight. He is so cool.
"
4,17,Stan,"No not ham!
"
11,7,Mr. Mackey,"Nice one, Randy.
"
10,3,Cartman,"Well Kyle, we'd better get going.
"
5,10,Stan,"Cartman, where are you going?? 
"
3,15,Kyle,"Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3,13,Cartman,"Holy crap! 
"
15,9,Butters,"Wow.
"
13,13,Wendy,"I really don't care, Stan.
"
9,12,Randy,"Well, if you really think your life is so bad, Stan, why don't you take what you have out of your bicycle savings?!
"
12,11,Kyle,"Yeah, what a dick!
"
6,6,Butters,"It certainly is, Mother. Did ya hear about what's been goin' on? Some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order ot Bennigan's.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"But this is insane!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Look at it, dude. You're not offering any fabulous prizes. You have to offer fabulous prizes if you want people to show up for your stupid crap. Here. 
"
8,11,Cartman,"Oooo, hang on, Jimmy, it looks like Kyle has the dish on some students' bathroom habits. Kyle?
"
8,10,Stan,"But mom, my teacher will-
"
14,1,Kenny,"(Really??)
"
2,13,Cartman,"I'm right!
"
9,5,Stan,"Dad!  You're the greatest. 
"
7,12,Randy,"Look, uh, I actually came over because I'm a little concerned about some of the things you told my son.
"
18,3,Randy,"Oh really? About... about what?
"
3,4,Cartman,"Now, LISTEN to me! Hurlong kashurshar! All right?! And seriously: Hurlong kepur shung kwong!
"
6,16,Butters,"Nobody asked.
"
2,12,Randy,"Hey, back off, cunt!
"
7,14,Stan,"Kyle, will you talk to Wendy for me?
"
4,1,Cartman,"Well, come on! I don't have much time! 
"
3,13,Mr. Garrison,"Because you never know the right answer, butt-for-brains! Yes, Mark?
"
3,16,Stan,"Dude, what are we gonna do for New Year's Eve? It has to be awesome.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(I wanna be really good)
"
1,3,Kyle,"Kill it, Stanley. Kill it.  Come on Stan, kill it.
"
13,8,Cartman,"HA! What a dumbass! 
"
8,13,Kenny,"(Don't take it personally, Kyle.)
"
12,2,Kyle,"Doctor, could we talk to her for a minute?
"
2,15,Kyle,"It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
"
4,2,Stan,"Because that's what we're doing!
"
8,9,Randy,"Staaaan? 
"
5,3,Cartman,"Ah!  Ow, stop it!  Ah! 
"
13,9,Butters,"Uyeah, I guess I deserve it.
"
7,4,Kyle,"What are you doing?
"
11,8,Kyle,"What?
"
15,5,Cartman,"How hard can it be, Clyde?! You walk up to Slash when he's playing at the mall and you offer him a deal!
"
16,14,Kyle,"I don't believe it.
"
14,4,Cartman,"Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect.
"
10,8,Cartman,"Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans.
"
5,4,Stan,"Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable.
"
10,6,Cartman,"Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!!  Dowww!
"
3,1,Stan,"Hey. Maybe Cartman was right.
"
1,11,Wendy,"U-huh. Excuse me.  Ka fahra qehlaq hemblaq!
"
4,16,Cartman,"Butters, I need an ETA on the car, stat. 
"
11,12,Cartman,"Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. 
"
6,16,Stan,"What?
"
1,10,Stan,"Sh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.
"
13,9,Cartman,"Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this.  Alright, you ready? Now say ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" Come on, dude, ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" 
"
15,7,Stan,"That doesn't sound like shit to you?
"
15,9,Kyle,"Butters has been missing for a week! You might have inadvertently gotten him killed!
"
9,3,Stan,"Huh?
"
1,1,Cartman,"What?
"
13,3,Stan,"What do you mean? I have I have a hundred dollars.
"
16,11,Kyle,"Kenny, you're clearly his best friend. Go stop him.
"
7,12,Stan,"Yeah.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Everyone! Everyone, a Black Friday toast. How awesome that we are all friends again. Our two houses brought together. Soon we will all have our PlayStation 4s.  And to you, my old friend, Princess Kenny. You really look stunning. No doubt the gods have smiled down upon your perky boobs.  Now, if you'll excuse my, my lady, I need to take a shit.  What have you found out?
"
1,13,Stan,"Aaawww.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Well if they found somebody else's sea men in her stomach, maybe they'll find our sea people, too.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Eugh! Stay on him! I'm not giving up! 
"
13,6,Randy,"Ey Hollis. You, uh, you guys race already?
"
6,9,Kyle,"Dude, don't you see that it's not? It'd be like, changing Raiders of the Lost Ark!
"
15,7,Randy,"...So. Here we are. Now we're the old people who think the younger generation's music sounds like shit.
"
14,6,Stan,"Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. 
"
4,9,Kenny,"(That sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Dude!)
"
16,5,Cartman,"The studio backed out! The producer had a change of heart! BOOOOO!
"
1,12,Kyle,"Yyeeaahh.
"
13,14,Stan,"Come on, dude, you've gotta swim.
"
3,3,Stan,"Wait you guys.  Maybe, is it possible that we're just jealous because Chef is our friend, and now he's paying attention to somebody new? 
"
1,3,Kyle,"They're out fishing with Kenny.
"
1,3,Cartman,"My mom says there's a lot of black people in Africa.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Nuh-uh.
"
6,16,Stan,"What?? I have to share my room with my future self?? Oh no! 
"
2,12,Randy,"Oh, please!
"
8,12,Butters,"Oh.Yeah, actually, they did say that'd be all right.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Damint! Give me all you've got, then! 
"
18,5,Butters,"Are you out of your mind?! What are you doing?!
"
17,9,Cartman,"Dude, we're not gonna betray you. Come on! Did you see Prometheus? I don't think the writers even knew what that was about.
"
4,2,Kenny,"(Oh, my God!)
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Do you have a feather on your head?
"
8,1,Kyle,"Where?!
"
8,4,Stan,"Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.
"
18,3,Kyle,"Then don't eat 14 Egg waffles for lunch, fatass!
"
3,9,Kenny,"(How do you do that?)
"
10,8,Kyle,"Yeah yeah.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Hey, it isn't my fault that Iraqis are filled with hate!
"
11,12,Kyle,"Stan?
"
1,4,Cartman,"Did you check the shopping ma-  Ow!
"
11,13,Stan,"No problem.
"
2,13,Kyle,"You suck, Cartman!
"
4,17,Kyle,"What?
"
12,6,Kyle,"I've even unplugged it and plugged it back in.
"
8,11,Stan,"I knew we could do it!
"
11,8,Kyle,"Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!
"
3,4,Kyle,"We'll just have to keep throwing jabs to win the fight.
"
14,2,Randy,"""Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-"" What? ""He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-""  ""That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest."" Oh... Oh, man.
"
18,1,Cartman,"I told you guys! ""Washington Redskins"" totally gets people's attention!
"
9,1,Kyle,"But why not? You said sometimes people need surgery to make them feel better about themselves.
"
5,3,Kyle,"Cartman! Cartman, wake up! Cartman!
"
3,1,Stan,"Please don't make me go on a choir tour, Mom, please!
"
12,11,Kyle,"How do you do that?
"
1,6,Stan,"Hi grampa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay.
"
10,10,Cartman,"You got a hall pass, brah?!
"
17,8,Butters,"Please. It's urgent.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Egh-- 
"
10,7,Cartman,"Ooo, Colonel?
"
12,14,Butters,"Ahh, dangit! 
"
13,10,Jimmy,"You can s-, you can suck, suck my balls!
"
18,9,Butters,"What's a PewDiePie do?
"
5,13,Cartman,"My baby takes the morning train and she takes another home again. Hmm.  What do we have heah? 
"
12,8,Cartman,"Dude! What the fuck are you doing?!
"
7,8,Kyle,"Hi Mom, Hi Dad!
"
18,5,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, but how can we keep that close a watch on the whole neighborhood?
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, what are you doing here?
"
12,8,Butters,"Aw, I did it again?
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Mr. Garrison, are you alright?
"
13,9,Butters,"Sure, Kyle.
"
15,11,Randy,"Right here, brah! 
"
12,12,Kyle,"Yes, ah I'm trying to locate my parents. M-my name is Kyle Broflovski. Yes, I know Obama won.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Nahit chaim.)  (Ha! Hiheh haha.)  (Hah! Oh my God!)
"
15,7,Kyle,"I know! That's so hilarious!
"
9,8,Stan,"Uh, hey Dad.
"
10,2,Stan,"Nooo!
"
16,3,Stan,"Well, I'm glad we took care of that.
"
6,8,Stan,"Yeah. It does. 
"
1,1,Wendy,"Hi, guys.
"
3,10,Cartman,"No, Kitty, these are my spicy-hot Louisiana-baked Chicken Tenders!
"
12,2,Kyle,"Excuse me, is this really what you think she should be doing right now?
"
12,6,Randy,"NetZero.
"
7,8,Kyle,"Hey dudes. 
"
1,7,Cartman,"There's no such thing as UFOs. 
"
1,8,Stan,"Oh.
"
2,4,Mr. Garrison,"And so now, children, your school counselor is back, to tell you firsthand about his nasty experience with drugs and alcohol. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Pass me the ball!  Pass me the ball, Craig, you stupid asshole!  Kyle, what the F?!
"
9,3,Stan,"Yeah!
"
11,5,Randy,"Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet! 
"
6,2,Stan,"Gah, let's go you guys. 
"
16,8,Butters,"I was havin' happy dreams, about a girl and-!
"
10,6,Stan,"He could be half bear, half manpig.
"
9,11,Cartman,"The same, you and I!
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"Beat it, you're not gettin' the job! 
"
6,13,Kyle,"We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
"
11,2,Butters,"Whoa! Hey Dad! 
"
12,2,Kyle,"Whew.
"
12,7,Butters,"No!  T-Teacherrr! Teacherrr!
"
11,1,Stan,"God dammit!
"
9,11,Kyle,"Kenny!
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, we've just received word from the mayor that the Christmas play can't include any Christmas lights, since they offend people with epilepsy...
"
8,2,Cartman,"Ah, screw you hippies!
"
15,7,Stan,"Oh cool, is this the new Gersploosh album?
"
3,13,Cartman,"Eeehhh.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle?
"
7,6,Cartman,"Now, go sit on the toilet and pull and tug on your wiener until white stuff comes out, and then put it in this cup.
"
15,1,Kyle,"The first what?
"
11,12,Stan,"The Chosen One?
"
1,11,Stan,"It's because I'm not a lesbian, isn't it?
"
2,17,Stan,"'Cause then they'll know we didn't write it, dummy! We have to be original!
"
2,9,Kyle,"Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?
"
15,10,Stan,"Quick, we need something to carry him in!
"
14,5,Cartman,"Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?
"
7,11,Butters,"Hwaaaah!!
"
18,1,Cartman,"Indifferent Rectal Semen Splooge is taken too?! Come! On!
"
10,6,Kyle,"Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!
"
15,12,Cartman,"That's an excellent point, Muscleman Marc. Please continue.
"
9,12,Stan,"Yeah, yeah!
"
4,9,Stan,"Uh-oh.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Shh! Tweek, shut the hell up!
"
16,11,Butters,"Uh yeah, I uh, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go?
"
2,7,Cartman,"Heellp! 
"
10,9,Cartman,"So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did?  Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. . Kyle!
"
1,6,Kenny,"(I did, I gotta go again...)
"
13,13,Kyle,"Oh well, at least as president you can run the school the way you want.
"
11,7,Randy,"Wahhh! I don't have any more change!  Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange! 
"
13,7,Cartman,"Kevin, Jesus Christ!  Hard to starboard, lads! There's sure to be lots of booties out hyah!  Clyde, the fuck?!
"
14,2,Stan,"I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said ""shit"" and ""fuck"" a few times.
"
13,14,Butters,"You can do it, Kyle!
"
4,7,Stan,"Okay, here we go.  Okay, let's see. Looks like if we cut here, and here...
"
5,6,Stan,"Kyle?  Dude, what are you doing here? Everybody's looking for you. Kyle?
"
9,13,Stan,"Quick, call Kyle.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should go get a-  Huh?! 
"
1,6,Stan,"What the hell is wrong with everybody?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Come on, Butters, you and me are gonna try to catch Jewpacabra on camera.
"
1,10,Kyle,"Hey, you just got here, Chef!
"
11,4,Kyle,"All right! MapQuest the address!
"
12,10,Kyle,"This is wrong. Uh this just doesn't make any sense. Why would Homeland Security send us into Peru?
"
10,1,Kenny,"(Yeah! I think...)
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to nominate a class president?  Oh, come on! You can't have an election with just one person running! What's the fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're a genius.
"
18,1,Stan,"Angry Clit Spasm
"
10,2,Kyle,"What?!
"
14,4,Stan,"Fuck off, Dad. 
"
17,9,Cartman,"Because, because what? Because he's cute?
"
2,18,Stan,"Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?
"
3,8,Randy,"With two girls or two guys?
"
1,1,Cartman,"Or slip her the tongue.
"
15,8,Kyle,"Next please.  Oh, hey.
"
5,2,Stan,"Huh?
"
11,2,Cartman,"I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!
"
3,16,Kyle,"Okay. Today's word is ""spirituality."" What that means to me is uh- 
"
12,2,Stan,"Oh no.
"
3,1,Mr. Garrison,"All right, that does it!!
"
9,6,Cartman,"What do you mean?
"
3,8,Randy,"Well, of course we wouldn't.
"
8,8,Mr. Mackey,"What the? They're all dead? Well, that means...
"
5,7,Kyle,"Yeah. Quick!
"
8,3,Kyle,"Oh okay, but did God sent Jesus TO die, or did Jesus just get kind of screwed over.
"
5,8,Stan,"We... don't... care.
"
11,13,Kyle,"For reals? 
"
6,2,Cartman,"And then, you pee on it!  heheh-heheheheheheheh.
"
8,7,Stan,"We're doing it!
"
5,11,Cartman,"Aw, Jesus, why don't you just cut off my balls?
"
6,13,Cartman,"And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
"
4,4,Mr. Mackey,"Yes, of course.
"
13,6,Randy,"That's 'cause you're a chick! Now just leave us alone!  Don't worry, son, the Hollises are not beating us this year! I went and got something to put inside our car and make it go extra-fast. 
"
12,9,Wendy,"This is a serious issue, Eric! What you're doing is very offensive!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Ee-yes, by doing that,  and, putting a dollar in the box-uh!
"
5,12,Stan,"Alright, well, let's just watch the Lion King. Cartman's cheating anyway. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Yeah, you forgot. Just like a lot of people lately have forgot that AIDS is still killing people! Seems like all of America has forgot that HIV is a serious disease.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Next audition!
"
10,1,Stan,"Knew what?
"
11,13,Kyle,"I don't really see the fun in...  ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
"
2,10,Kyle,"Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
"
4,6,Kenny,"(No.)
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Now, let's try it again.  SUCK MY BALLS!
"
11,14,Cartman,"They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"I know that IntelliLink has had some... hiccups... uhkay. But I've hired a new faculty member whose sole responsibility will be to oversee the IntelliLink system and make sure it runs smoothly. I want you all to meet Pat Conners. 
"
13,8,Stan,"Are you guys fucking serious?
"
4,9,Kyle,"Dude, he's pretty dead.
"
10,3,Kyle,"I have no idea!
"
1,9,Mr. Mackey,"Oh that's good.  You see, Kyle, sometimes we feel like an outsider, we-we create friends, Okay-in our minds, Okay?
"
10,2,Cartman,"Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! 
"
1,13,Cartman,"I am going to fucking kill you guys, seriously. 
"
1,10,Cartman,"YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GET ME THE RED MEGA MAN, EH! NOW I CAN'T MAKE THE ULTRA MEGA MEGA MAN, YOU DIRTY CHEAP-ASS PIECE OF CRAP! 
"
1,7,Mr. Garrison,"Thank you Miss Yothers.  Okay, the second place award for best costume goes to... Kenny, for his Edward James Olmos costume.  And the award for the very best costume goes to... Wendy, for her Chewbacca costume! 
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Yes, you certainly are. And for doing that, we have all decided to give you... a comedy award.
"
5,11,Kyle,"I don't know about this, guys. I think sleds are dangerous.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Cool!
"
12,7,Butters,"No! 
"
11,10,Kyle,"Dude! 
"
15,11,Randy,"She started in the car, and then it lasted the whole drive home, and then, she kept going for like another twenty minutes.
"
3,8,Randy,"You, you never have a homosexual fantasy? Not that I have.
"
10,11,Randy,"I'm a geologist! 
"
8,10,Cartman,"Oh, Holy Jesus, God...
"
1,2,Stan,"Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?
"
6,13,Stan,"I will take it!  I will walk to the video store.
"
15,9,Butters,"AAAAH!  I'll get over! 
"
3,11,Stan,"He's not done for, he's standing right there.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre.
"
4,2,Stan,"Damnit! And we thought we were so original!
"
1,3,Cartman,"They don't think Scuzzlebutt is scary huh? Let's see how they like it when they actually see Scuzzlebutt! I'll scare the hell out of them tomorrow!
"
11,6,Kyle,"Oh God, here we go again.
"
14,4,Stan,"""Edit profile. Basic... settings"" Jesus Christ!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall.  So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--
"
17,6,Kyle,"Hold on everybody. This thing isn't even a-
"
3,11,Kyle,"Oh, no, dude!
"
1,1,Kyle,"I'm in big trouble, you guys! We have to do something!
"
12,10,Stan,"Yeah dude, I'm- I'm starting to realize that it's like the easiest job in the world. You know, I mean, we could do that! 
"
4,12,Kyle,"Yeah. No more getting pushed around by fourth graders! 
"
2,5,Mr. Mackey,"Do we have to eat kosher stuff?
"
17,7,Butters,"Uh, sorry, I haven't watched it yet.
"
14,3,Cartman,"This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
"
6,6,Butters,"I am Professor Chaos! Bringer of destruction and maker of doom! Those who do not know me yet shall know me very soon, for the hour of Chaos ih-is at hand! 
"
2,14,Stan,"Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?
"
2,5,Kyle,"Yeah, you're from China.
"
9,2,Stan,"Yeah!
"
4,2,Stan,"U-uh, Chef.
"
9,8,Kyle,"How?
"
13,2,Cartman,"I can't tell you what happened 'cause it's about my super secret double life!
"
14,8,Cartman,"I'm back own the track.  What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!
"
12,8,Cartman,"Everyone get up and go over to that wall! Do it! Move!  We, are the American Liberation Front! And you are ALL going to pay for betraying your country to the Chinese!
"
11,4,Cartman,"You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Uh huh. 'Cause I thought I was messing with Butters, but I'm actually the one trapped in virtual reality.
"
10,12,Cartman,"Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! 
"
9,6,Butters,"Hey Eric! 
"
1,6,Randy,"Ha, ha, ha, that's our silly grampa.
"
17,10,Butters,"I'm sorry, Wendy, but I have a different standard when it comes to my women.  I want a woman who takes care of herself and knows how to look good, who's got perfect skin and no splotches on her legs, and perfect ehhverything.
"
14,8,Cartman,"It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
"
18,10,Randy,"Please. Do you know what's going on here? What are the producers trying to do?
"
7,3,Mr. Mackey,"We're gonna talk to you one at a time, boys, m'kay? Kenny, will you step into my office, please?
"
18,9,Cartman,"Adults so don't get what's cool anymore.
"
15,7,Stan,"'Night.  Haha.  Ugh.  What the hell? 
"
13,12,Jimmy,"I have had it with those loud, annoying, f-f-f f-faggots.
"
14,4,Kyle,"'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button...  and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm...  Okay, now I can read the sign you put up...
"
13,1,Stan,"Oh, boy.
"
5,9,Stan,"Go America.
"
9,1,Kyle,"But I feel like a basketball player. That's all I wanna do. 
"
18,5,Butters,"Okay, uh maybe that's enough. 
"
6,5,Stan,"Get all the stuff! 
"
7,9,Butters,"Eric, I-I'm pretty sure you shouldn't say the F-word about-uh Jesus.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Cartman, they killed Kenny!
"
15,12,Kyle,"We told him to grow up. So he got rid of his stuffed animals.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Well if you get grounded in virtual reality you get grounded in real life too! For EVER! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Good.
"
9,14,Randy,"Look, I, I really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again.
"
13,13,Wendy,"It's okay Dad, I'll take care of it.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are you?
"
3,2,Kyle,"Wow!
"
11,5,Cartman,"Bye, Easter bunny! 
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Oh, I don't think that'll be hard. I've been working on my rr... routine.
"
5,12,Stan,"Sure, dude, you're our friend.
"
7,5,Butters,"Holy geez wow! There's Ben Affleck, too!
"
9,11,Cartman,"I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I've called this meeting because, I don't know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we're thought of as somehow less important, and it's bullcrap!
"
1,11,Stan,"Yeah! We'll go to the mall tonight! 
"
15,12,Jimmy,"Yeah. It's not a bad idea. If all the students unite, we can work together to fight the f-f-fit.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Yeah, I guess now we'll have to call him Ben Assfleck.  Ben Assfleck, say that's funny.
"
2,8,Stan,"Whatever, dude.
"
18,9,Stan,"Oh no, what now?
"
6,13,Cartman,"And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
"
15,5,Cartman,"We made a thousand dollars in eleven days. 
"
4,2,Cartman,"That's right. Keep the change, my man.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Tell everyone you made the cow look like that!
"
7,11,Kyle,"I should have known better! You never cared about my birthday at all!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Then I shall bid you good morning, gentlemen, and see you on the battlefield. 
"
16,1,Jimmy,"Wow, that's weird.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Don't worry, dude. That little truck just runs on D batteries. It's gonna run out of juice soon. 
"
8,11,Cartman,"I-I did. I wrote something down.  Here it is! Uh, squiggly line, circle. 
"
10,8,Cartman,"Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?
"
3,17,Cartman,"Okay, how about this one, Kenny? 
"
18,10,Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah! Dude, check it out. Lady Gaga is singing Christmas songs. Isn't she a Jew?
"
4,3,Randy,"Um...  Everyone who has a grandma, step forward.  Uh, not so fast, girls. 
"
12,9,Wendy,"No you aren't!
"
17,9,Stan,"We're done with betrayal! It's time to put an end to this!
"
6,12,Stan,"I can't see. 
"
11,5,Stan,"So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
"
4,16,Kyle,"Mom! Dad!
"
10,8,Randy,"Okay. 
"
11,10,Cartman,"Yesss!
"
16,9,Cartman,"See what I mean? You can't even walk around a Wall-Mart anymore without getting run over by some fat dick on a Rascal.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Can't we just play hide and seek at home?
"
8,7,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
13,14,Cartman,"Well, I do just as much work.
"
14,9,Kyle,"I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!
"
10,3,Kyle,"Uhhh...
"
1,10,Cartman,"Don't mind him, Jesus, he's Jewish.
"
3,13,Cartman,"Eehh, shut up.  Ooohhh, yeasss.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Dumbass, if there's sixty percent of them to forty percent of us, then who's the minority?!
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, sorry. So I can keep it then?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Well, I'm a badass cowboy living in a cowboy's
Age wicky wicky scratch yo yo bang bang
Me and Artemus Clyde Frog go save
Salma Hayek from the big metal spider
Wicky wicky wick, wicky wicky wick, Fresh
Cowboy from the Westside-
"
1,9,Wendy,"UUuuhh-UUuuhh 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I know that, I was being f-f-f-fa...cetious! 
"
5,8,Stan,"...O-kay.
"
9,10,Stan,"What's up?! Oh, nothing except that you've been trying to impress Wendy all week long like a pathetic dickhole!
"
4,12,Kyle,"You know, I heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from Denver.
"
5,7,Stan,"Huh??
"
4,14,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! Okay, fine! Helen Keller can have TWO pet turkeys! 
"
5,8,Stan,"No no, it's okay, Mom. We c-we can't go to baseball practice 'cause Kyle has cancer.
"
11,4,Kyle,"Yeah.  What is that?
"
2,7,Stan,"Oh my God! Kenny- killed... death!
"
17,6,Butters,"Whoa, look at it!
"
2,3,Randy,"Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
"
4,2,Kyle,"Yeah. But you know, I've learned something today. You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Aww, suck-up, suck-up!  What?! That's an obvious suck-up move.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Thanks again, Tim-Tim.
"
2,17,Cartman,"Oh, so that's where all my underpants go.
"
17,6,Stan,"I don't think Kyle really loves Cartman's farts. There's something else going on.
"
16,9,Cartman,"You condone Rascal-tipping, Kyle?! Do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized?!
"
12,6,Stan,"Kyle, I need to use your Internet
"
6,16,Stan,"You know that thing that I kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that I've never told anybody about?  You know, the thing that I take out of the shoebox every night before I go to sleep?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Noooooo! 
"
6,5,Stan,"Wait a minute! Look!  ""The following preview has..."" This is it! This is it!
"
9,6,Butters,"Well, he's sittin' next to me right now.
"
11,4,Kyle,"Yeah, this guy.  Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.
"
13,6,Randy,"Alright,  that's 2.8 centimeters... should give us a drag of only.. 26 milliseconds. Hold the front here, Stan. 
"
6,4,Kyle,"You're getting in pretty deep, dude. 
"
16,9,Kyle,"What?
"
5,10,Kyle,"Alright. 
"
15,11,Randy,"You just don't get it, Stotch! I'm telling you, go see Wicked! It's the best time!
"
11,3,Cartman,"All right, now everyone back over there!  We'll start with what I already know. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"It's so unfair! How can my parents do that to me?!
"
9,3,Kyle,"Twenty dollars.
"
18,5,Cartman,"You wanna take it out for a spin?
"
2,15,Stan,"We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.
"
13,12,Kyle,"We aren't talking about gay people.
"
15,13,Kyle,"You might as well just say Pilgrims and Indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty!
"
11,14,Stan,"Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?
"
18,3,Cartman,"Oh, what are you?! A cissy too, Clyde?!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Alright Token, come on! This is ridiculous. I know you totally wanna kick my ass right now. You'd like to walk right up and punch me in the face, but what's that gonna solve? I've got a way better idea.  First bump?  Come on dude, fist bump. Bump that shit bro. Be the bigger person. 
"
1,3,Stan,"No!  I can do it Uncle Jimbo. I want to bag that animal!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Butters.
"
2,18,Stan,"I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!
"
12,7,Kyle,"Will you shut up!
"
13,10,Cartman,"Noo, let's save the ""girlfriend is a whore"" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again.
"
7,4,Kyle,"Oh no you don't, Cartman! Every time we get put in a study group, you sit on your ass while the rest of us do all the work!
"
6,7,Stan,"Okay. Goodnight, Cartman. 
"
11,14,Wendy,"Of course, Stan. 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Okay, that takes care of Token, Clyde, and Mr. Kitty. That's eveyone, I guess.  All that leaves is you, Butters. Butters, I'm sorry if I ever did anything to hurt you.
"
5,11,Kyle,"But I'll get snow on my gloves and then it will melt and I'll have wet hands.
"
12,2,Kyle,"You mean everyone has been wanting Britney Spears to kill herself?
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yeah!
"
14,6,Cartman,"Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!
"
11,13,Stan,"I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. 
"
14,14,Cartman,"Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!
"
6,5,Kyle,"Look, it's almost time.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Wow, that's... really great to hear.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Dude, who the hell is Mitch Connor?
"
11,6,Butters,"But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas.
"
11,14,Butters,"Hey ugly! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Not the next song, the next PERSON!  Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass day. 
"
7,14,Butters,"Okay. 
"
16,1,Jimmy,"A...a...a...a sue-ance?
"
11,9,Stan,"Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Sweet!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Dude, fuck you!)
"
7,14,Stan,"Maybe I should. At least they will understand me. Maybe I should hang with the Goth kids.
"
8,10,Stan,"You see, Mom, all the kids at school were told to bring a picture of their moms' breasts for anatomy class.
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"And be ready for a quiz tomorrow morning.
"
4,6,Cartman,"KIIICK ASS!
"
3,10,Stan,"Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. 
"
10,6,Cartman,"Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I...  habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! 
"
3,12,Kyle,"Oh, my God.  Hi, ...Grandma.
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Wow! Isn't that amazing Mr. Hat?
"
2,15,Stan,"Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! 
"
16,10,Cartman,"It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan. You should have respected my authoritay. 
"
16,8,Randy,"Huh?
"
13,13,Wendy,"Maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does, before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you! 
"
4,9,Randy,"The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. 
"
6,17,Kyle,"We don't know. They lost all contact with him.
"
15,2,Stan,"Yeah, look uh, I don't think I can make it, Jimmy.
"
13,8,Kyle,"Comoe back here! 
"
11,1,Stan,"Then stop being mad!
"
7,7,Randy,"It's cool on my tongue.
"
2,11,Kyle,"We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!
"
4,15,Kyle,"He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Who's this asshole?
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"But I never know what to write about.
"
17,2,Randy,"I've tried! It's not like other video games. I really don't get it. It was all retro and like Legos, but, then a bunch of kids online called me a griefer and kicked me off.
"
2,11,Kyle,"He got a full dose of the stars.
"
8,9,Stan,"H-Dad, come on! We've gotta get out!
"
6,3,Kyle,"Yeah, he sure is.
"
7,6,Mr. Garrison,"Right, but who was the fattest oldest skank on her period?!  That's what I thought! Now pay attention!  Okay, children, now, the biggest fatass was an old skank by the name of-
"
16,12,Randy,"Oh. Oh I get it!  Video stores are so old they have ghosts in them! Okay, thanks! I get it! But you're wrong!
"
18,9,Kyle,"Do you mind?!
"
1,11,Kenny,"(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"All right children, let's take our seats.
"
12,8,Cartman,"You can just deal with the Chinese invasion yourself if that's how you're gonna do it, Butters! I'm out, man.
"
12,1,Kyle,"I'm gonna kill you, Cartman!
"
8,7,Kyle,"Dude. 
"
7,14,Butters,"Hi! Is Lexus here?
"
8,9,Kyle,"I think I see the television department in the back!
"
3,12,Kyle,"That's not scary, fatass!
"
3,5,Cartman,"No way, dude! What would I wipe with?
"
10,13,Cartman,"Science-damnit!  Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"No! No, I... haven't... taught in over... eight... months. 
"
3,3,Kyle,"Look, we've just gotta get Chef alone. He won't listen to reason with that hooker around.
"
15,6,Butters,"Please, Billy, ah I'm just a kid too. I can't help you.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Oh yeah, boy. Take a look at this, ma'am.  See that? Hippies. 
"
3,2,Kyle,"No, I don't think so.
"
12,2,Stan,"Butters, do you want your share of the hundred thousand dollars or not?
"
9,5,Kyle,"Jesus Christ! They can bat themselves out!  Our whole summer, dude. We have to play this boring game all summer long.
"
13,8,Kyle,"Dude, asshole, you're keeping a lot of other celebrities in purgatory!
"
6,7,Cartman,"I got RIPPED OFF! 
"
12,9,Cartman,"Butters, get out of here!
"
6,6,Cartman,"Oh, thanks Jimmy
"
4,17,Kyle,"Jesus, this sucks! All they keep doin' is dancing around!
"
6,16,Stan,"AAAH! 
"
5,8,Kyle,"What? You mean Towelie? 
"
18,5,Butters,"No, Eric. I don't wanna d-
"
2,3,Kyle,"Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?
"
6,15,Stan,"No, it can't be.
"
9,12,Stan,"Really?
"
5,8,Cartman,"Hooray!
"
6,4,Cartman,"You're going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves.
"
2,14,Stan,"Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up.
"
9,10,Stan,"Well maybe I didn't want to have an egg with you, okay Bebe?!
"
9,1,Kyle,"You're right.  Jesus, that was fun...
"
10,3,Stan,"Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Check it out: Now we're going into the secret underground base.
"
5,1,Kyle,"It's okay. The curse has been lifted. 
"
1,4,Cartman,"No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.
"
2,18,Stan,"Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him.
"
7,15,Cartman,"I'm just saying, maybe Jesus is having a little revenge, that's all.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow. You know, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right. If you're pissing blood, you can shove a tampon up your peehole. You are very insightful. Please tell me more.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Cartman, stop! You don't know what you're doing!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Oh, hey Timmy. I'm glad you called, very much. I've been detecting some a-animosity towards me lately, and I was hoping we could bury the hatchet.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Aw, crap, there's more of them?
"
1,13,Kyle,"Yeah. He was doing their voices and pouring tea for them.
"
11,14,Kyle,"You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! 
"
7,6,Cartman,"Follow me to the bathroom. 
"
14,4,Stan,"Okay I'll be your friend.
"
5,2,Randy,"Yeah. Both Kenny's dad and I were in Scouts for years.
"
7,14,Butters,"Well, thanks for offerin' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I'd rather be a cryin' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. 
"
14,5,Randy,"Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes? 
"
10,8,Stan,"Come on, let's do this!
"
8,3,Kyle,"Yeah, I know, but I have to-
"
6,5,Stan,"Hurry! We can't miss the commercials!
"
3,11,Stan,"We brought Marvin and his people to live here, but these buttholes followed us.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too? 
"
6,1,Kyle,"Well, that's not really what you say in the commercial.
"
9,9,Kyle,"Now look, Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works. Once you know how to operate it, just grab it and get the hell out of there.
"
9,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well why the hell not?!
"
3,17,Kyle,"Shut up, fatass!
"
2,6,Stan,"Dude, he's okay. That frog wasn't even real!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward.  NASCAR! Yee-ah!
"
4,9,Cartman,"We... are Fingerbang!
"
6,3,Cartman,"Did he say ""the... largest putt-putt golf course in the world""?
"
12,6,Randy,"Stan! Stan, I gotta use your computer! 
"
4,16,Kyle,"My parents said I can't go.
"
1,12,Kyle,"We've got to get rid of them.  Nobody should have the kind of power Barbra Streisand wanted! 
"
6,12,Randy,"No, no. We shouldn't bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.
"
9,6,Butters,"Wow.
"
11,11,Cartman,"Kyle?
"
10,12,Butters,"Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?
"
8,9,Stan,"What?!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Oh on that side?
"
1,1,Kyle,"No.
"
17,8,Butters,"But you said they were on their way like three hours ago! 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Mackey, um... I can't go to Arkansas. Somebody's gonna have to fill in for me.
"
6,3,Butters,"But fellas, if I go on Maury Povish, with- with my balls on my chin, my parents are gonna get really mad.
"
6,10,Kyle,"No way! Tweek's cool!
"
9,8,Stan,"Nothing
"
3,8,Randy,"Okay. 
"
8,13,Cartman,"Okay, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day, let us go on to-
"
10,4,Kyle,"Thanks a lot for the ride.
"
6,12,Stan,"Kenny's parents must be laughing pretty hard about now! We're dumb enough to believe Kenny's body could be in a teapot!
"
6,7,Kyle,"Whoa. 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Hey! You son of a bitch!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Oh, my God, this guy again. 
"
8,10,Butters,"Uh... outside? No way! 
"
13,14,Butters,"Come on, Kyle!
"
18,3,Randy,"With what?  With what? 
"
18,10,Cartman,"Sorry guys, I gotta go. The world needs CartmanBrah. 
"
8,1,Cartman,"All right. Looks like I have to use my power of invisibility to get by.
"
1,5,Stan,"Yeah.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Oh there she is! There's my mom right now! 
"
10,10,Cartman,"All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ. 
"
4,6,Butters,"Huh-you mean to expect me to go out there and let all those... huhu-horny old men... have their way with my fragile person?? Well just what team is this anyway?!
"
2,10,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
8,5,Cartman,"...No way.
"
12,9,Wendy,"You don't understand. He said horrible things.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?
"
16,12,Cartman,"That's right!
"
8,3,Stan,"All right, let's get the hell out of here! 
"
18,6,Kyle,"Sure. Come on, guys. 
"
11,5,Randy,"We... need to talk, Stan.  Ih, it's okay guys.
"
12,12,Randy,"He's so awesome!  He's so perfect and awesome!
"
15,8,Cartman,"Gee, thanks Kyle!
"
3,11,Cartman,"No way, not Utah. Utah's nothin' but missionaries.
"
4,11,Cartman,"No, come back! You face everlasting damnation!  Wait! No! No!  I can't be cheated out of my ten million dollars again! God damnit!
"
15,8,Stan,"Uh, nooo nonono, we're not doing this!
"
5,13,Kenny,"(Stan??)
"
9,11,Kyle,"You are such a manipulative asshole, Cartman.
"
6,1,Butters,"You mean like Jared?
"
1,3,Randy,"What the heck is this?  Yeah, Frank, it's uh Randy, Uh huh, good, good. Yeah, listen, the uh, the little needle's moving. Yeah, it's going back and forth really fast-what does that mean? … Uh huh … Uh huh … Let me check  Yeah, it's smoking. Uh huh. Oh really? Really? Oh my God! A volcano! 
"
10,8,Kenny,"(I think Kyle has fake titties, hahahaha)
"
7,1,Stan,"That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
"
2,18,Stan,"'K.
"
17,2,Cartman,"You should come down to his house. His dad just killed his mom.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Huh.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Alright Mom, how much money do you make? Like gross yearly income after taxes?
"
10,10,Kyle,"""stick it inside her and pee""
"
2,10,Stan,"Yeah, it's pretty weird. 
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Sally Bands?
"
2,14,Stan,"It's easy, dude. Chef Aid.
"
1,11,Cartman,"We were learning about how Yasmine Bleeth is going out with that...Richard Greco guy that used to be on 21 Jump Street but then he got his own show for just a little while- 
"
9,3,Cartman,"That's four hundred for us! We did it! 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Maybe he put that videotape in here somewhere.
"
4,6,Kenny,"(AAAARRRRHHH!)
"
4,14,Butters,"They've got special effects! 
"
1,7,Cartman,"Boo! I'm a ghost.
"
5,9,Cartman,"There you are! Where have you been? We have another anti-American video to create! 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Hey, dick-whore. I guess you saw the commercial, too.
"
3,12,Stan,"Come on, fatass, we have to go!
"
14,4,Stan,"Has anybody seen my stupid profile?!
"
16,1,Cartman,"Dude, I'm telling you it was fucking hysterical. Clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down. He was so embarrassed, dude, I thought he was gonna die.
"
8,1,Stan,"Don't worry, Kyle. Craig's not gonna tell on us. Come, ninjas, let's go.  All right, this is it.
"
2,9,Wendy,"No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.
"
10,6,Stan,"Oh no!
"
5,14,Butters,"Well, I know lying's bad, Dad. Y-you told me so.
"
3,5,Kyle,"It's stupid.
"
16,5,Butters,"My Grandma?
"
10,7,Cartman,"Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!
"
5,11,Cartman,"He's faaahn.
"
12,6,Kyle,"Hey, wait a minute.  Is it possible that...
"
9,6,Stan,"All right. Then let's just ignore him. From now on, let's not talk to him, let's not even acknowledge him.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй.
"
11,8,Cartman,"No, I'm just gonna go- 
"
3,5,Randy,"No problem, Jakov.
"
8,7,Randy,"We're going back to the pile.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Look: we hve the whole rec room to ourselves. Can't we all just try having some fun together?
"
8,12,Butters,"Please! Ah I don't want to live with her! She snores real bad, and she has a huge nose, and a squishy thing that lives in her pants! Please! Please don't sell me to her! 
"
5,8,Stan,"There it is. The Okama GameSphere. 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Haaaaah.
"
10,1,Stan,"No! 
"
3,17,Kyle,"Well, we can still pre-tend like we know what it means.
"
9,6,Kyle,"She's here!
"
6,16,Butters,"You're the Parental Revenge Center of Western America??
"
8,4,Randy,"Uh, listen. Uh, it was my fault that Stanley served your boys the other day. Uh, I told him to do it and I... We- well look I, I just came down here to tell you... it-  it- it's not on.
"
16,13,Cartman,"Yep, it's done. You know I spent five bucks on that stupid thing?!
"
15,11,Randy,"Really? Oh my Gaw!  Take a break, guys. this could be it!
"
13,14,Cartman,"Haa-aa. Yes, thank you.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Yes! They were tryingn to systematically make men into wusses so they could take over the world!
"
10,8,Stan,"I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak.
"
8,2,Cartman,"Go on, Kyle.
"
4,7,Stan,"Hi, doctor. 
"
5,13,Kyle,"Alright, we don't know for sure why Cartman is ditching school, but it has something to do with abortion. That's all we know.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Nothing. 
"
1,8,Stan,"Just a second fat-ass!
"
18,8,Randy,"All right, Sharon. I'm practicing. Cock magic is making a comeback.
"
14,2,Butters,"Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!
"
8,3,Cartman,"I already brought it, bitch! I brought it, set it down on the table and opened it, bitch!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Well, all alright, Goddamnit! I'll open the park to two people each day! But remember: anybody else you see trespassing the park...
"
8,8,Cartman,"We were just wondering who you might be voting for, for the school's new mascot.
"
8,11,Stan,"Hey, look, Craig just walked in. 
"
16,12,Stan,"Yeah.
"
8,9,Jimmy,"Hello, Mrs. M-marsh. Can I help g- Can I help you get a sh- shopping cart today?
"
7,12,Stan,"No.
"
5,3,Stan,"A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
"
4,7,Stan,"...I'll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don't care.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes. 
"
18,5,Butters,"That poor lady. Her vagina is everywhere. Poor Craig.
"
12,9,Cartman,"That's not why I did it.
"
7,15,Stan,"Ah, we're just passing through to see the new Prime Minister.
"
15,1,Stan,"Yeah, but it's all a mistake. He actually didn't read the agreement.
"
1,7,Cartman,"God damn it, my mom is not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!!
"
3,8,Stan,"Tell them not to burn us down.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Kyle, this is a private conversation.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Stan, you can't keep doing this to yourself. You have to go live.
"
6,1,Butters,"Aaaa!! 
"
13,4,Cartman,"You wanna tell me what's funny about two women shooting air from their vagina into a man's face?! No! No! See, some of us were eating when you showed that!
"
6,14,Randy,"Ah, here's the Arab as a terrorist. 
"
8,14,Stan,"What time is it?!
"
12,7,Butters,"Oh my God, the police are looking for us!
"
10,6,Stan,"Help!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Yeah! Go home, you little dildo!
"
15,11,Randy,"Bro'dwaaay!
"
8,6,Stan,"Mr. Jefferson, I have to go to school tomorrow!
"
10,7,Butters,"Whoopie! G and R Railroad!
"
9,12,Stan,"Three million dollars?
"
17,10,Wendy,"NO. That has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against Photoshopped images!
"
3,3,Cartman,"Because my eyes suck. But that doctor likes to torture me and I have to go back tomorrow, and I don't know what I'm gonna do.
"
3,15,Kyle,"with dreidel I shall play.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Oh thank you Mrs. Valmer.  Now let's see... The setup could be... ""Do you like fishsticks?""
"
17,7,Cartman,"You have a strong influence over the rest of the men, Lady McCormick. All I'm saying is when the time comes, I might need you to... use that influence to have Kyle taken care of. Do we understand each other?
"
10,8,Cartman,"You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf.
"
8,12,Wendy,"You guys, don't buy this stuff! Why do you want to be like Paris Hilton?
"
13,6,Stan,"Dad. Dad, you know we can't make the car go as fast as before with only the approved Pinewood Derby kit.
"
2,13,Stan,"Wow, why'd you get so cool all of a sudden? 
"
1,6,Stan,"What are you doing grampa?
"
12,2,Randy,"Oh-oh boy, what's she done now?
"
12,9,Wendy,"I'm finished! 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Ohhh.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Kyle, you don't understand! Casa Bonita is my most favorite place  in the whole world. I'll just, I'll just die if you don't take me! Please! 
"
11,5,Stan,"All right Jesus!
"
17,5,Kyle,"No, I just don't think it's healthy.
"
18,7,Butters,"More of the school. 
"
18,6,Stan,"It's just something to kill some time. Like Jimmy said, it's a cool way to zone out.
"
6,1,Stan,"Alright, now it's time for phase 2.
"
15,9,Cartman,"You guys, the game is over! Clearly I won. Give it up.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Uh, it's okay. We know the owner.
"
9,6,Butters,"Oh hamburgers.
"
17,7,Kenny,"(But Stan and Kyle are best friends)
"
5,6,Cartman,"Ugh... Two people?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Hey, look.  Hello?
"
9,6,Cartman,"I ate a bunch of chicken skin and it blew out my insides.
"
5,11,Kyle,"...Oh, and I hope one day to be an investment banker.
"
7,1,Stan,"You all right?
"
17,2,Randy,"Watching informative murder porn?
"
10,3,Cartman,"Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?
"
6,2,Randy,"Yeah, and to be honest, we're just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal.
"
13,3,Mr. Garrison,"It's just crazy, you know? Ev-everyone's affected by it. It's like all the money just... vanished.
"
12,8,Stan,"Oh God!
"
15,13,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
6,10,Cartman,"Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you...
"
6,8,Randy,"Noho, it doesn't work that way, son.
"
13,3,Randy,"Then perhaps soon our Economy will return to us.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Hey, what are you doing? 
"
5,6,Kyle,"Satan talked to God?
"
3,14,Cartman,"Damnit! Damnit, I was so close! Damnit!
"
7,14,Butters,"Wuh-ell yeah, and I'm sad, but at the same time I'm really happy that somethin' could make me feel that sad. It's like,  it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feelin' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...
"
3,15,Kyle,"Sure!
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall- everybody!
"
17,2,Randy,"...Murder porn? Stan, this is just an investigative crime show.
"
6,3,Stan,"Hell no, dude. Then we couldn't watch you on TV.
"
1,7,Cartman,"Ok, let's go trick-or-treatin' now, come on!
"
2,17,Cartman,"Bad! 
"
15,7,Kenny,"(Hit the X button, Kyle!)
"
1,1,Kyle,"You can't talk to Stan, Wendy. He throws up when you do.
"
16,13,Cartman,"Oh don't even start, Kenny! Just because you guys didn't buy into the bracelets doesn't mean you're smarter than me, okay?!  What's wrong with him?
"
2,12,Kyle,"Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!
"
2,12,Cartman,"Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built.  Oh, man!
"
11,2,Kyle,"Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
"
8,6,Kyle,"What?!
"
16,12,Randy,"Hey, you kids lookin' to rent some DVDs?
"
8,5,Butters,"Yeah. And then this other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Ahhh, good. A hostage will bring a fine ransom.  Well well well well well!
"
15,11,Randy,"Think about it, brah. How hard can writing a musical be? We need some musicians, some actors. We can put on our own shows right here in town.
"
4,13,Stan,"He did it!
"
6,7,Cartman,"No! I was looking in this magazine, and I found an ad for little ocean creatures that you can buy and raise in your room!
"
18,6,Randy,"I had a problem, but I was able to stop. Now I only drink gluten-free beer and wine. But with Stan, I think there's some darkness inside him that... doesn't... allow him to stop.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Check it out, you guys. I'm calf-curling. 
"
9,6,Cartman,"All right, Butters, you leave me no choice. 
"
17,2,Randy,"Oh crap, who could that be-?! Oh it's, it's, probably fuckin' Stan! Ah, hang on a second bud.  Come on it.  Oh hey Stan, what's up? 
"
16,1,Cartman,"They're saying Clyde left the toilet seat up again.
"
7,5,Cartman,"I'm not going out in his car.
"
11,13,Cartman,"Come on guys. Let's get out of here. 
"
7,7,Randy,"We can stand here as long as it takes. 
"
17,10,Stan,"I do? 
"
12,9,Cartman,"Um, recess is almost over, I don't I don't know if there's really time.
"
15,8,Stan,"How?... When all the things that made you laugh, just make you sick. How do you go on when nothing makes you happy? 
"
17,10,Wendy,"Wendy.
"
6,5,Kyle,"Oh, dude, I don't know how I can take it.
"
4,7,Butters,"Huh, where are we goin'?
"
3,16,Cartman,"Now, the word is ""spirituality."" I believe that the goddess in me is my spirituality because she-
"
7,6,Stan,"The arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub. 
"
11,9,Randy,"Well he's gotta see this.
"
9,6,Kyle,"We didn't think that by pretending you didn't exist, you would really change, but you really have.
"
5,14,Butters,"Yeah. Boy, you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now.
"
18,1,Kyle,"Yes we do! We have a sweet name.  I was wrong, Cartman. ""Washington Redskins"" is the perfect name. I think maybe I was jealous that I didn't come up with it.
"
13,10,Kyle,"You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"Get lost, you little dirtball!
"
1,4,Stan,"Shut up dude!  Sparky, where'd you get that pink scarf?
"
2,6,Kyle,"Wait a sec. Where is your producer?
"
12,6,Randy,"Oh. Uhh. There was a, there was a ghost! A-a-and-this, this ectoplasm!  Did you see the ghost?  It ran through here; it sli-it slimed me!
"
13,3,Randy,"What?!
"
12,1,Cartman,"My God...
"
15,8,Stan,"What? You guys are aliens?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Why, sure.  Hey uh I think I can... get through that stuff pretty quick, mm...  Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan.
"
17,10,Stan,"She looks pretty hot here.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are!
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm still going to stick with you.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Token, you signed with us!
"
1,11,Cartman,"I am, too!
"
1,3,Stan,"Yeah, Cartman's pee.
"
4,1,Stan,"All right! Let's do this!
"
11,13,Stan,"I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
"
4,7,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, well, maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something you've always wanted to do.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Which one is the good Cartman?
"
10,6,Stan,"Help!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Gentlemen, I thank you.
"
2,6,Stan,"No. We have to do a stupid report on Vietnam. You and Ned are the only guys we know who were there.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Here, give me some money, Cartman!  Lend me money, fat boy!
"
2,9,Cartman,"Aw, man, let's get out of here!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Many of you knew Kenny McCormick. He was a playful school-going eight-year-old. And then yesterday, he was  smacked down by the Lord-uh!  God bitch-slapped him right to the fiery depths of hell! So when will you go? Tomorrow? Ten years? Does it mattah?! No! Because unless you give this life to the Lord, that life belongs to Satan-uh!  But we cannot worship God in that church where that priest of sin resides,  so we will build a new church-uh. With crystal walls, a ceiling 80 feet high, and a slide that connects this part hmya  to this part hmya.  Who will help us?
"
10,12,Cartman,"I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.
"
12,6,Randy,"Jesus. Everyone's gonna go to Starbucks now.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits.
"
15,4,Cartman,"You're damn right! One point two inches! I'll have you know that my penis is a respectable 1.4 inches! Maybe it's still the smallest in school, but it's .2 inches bogger than you said!!
"
4,8,Cartman,"Interesting. Aaand, what side are we on?
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Wait a minute. Where is Eric?
"
2,15,Stan,"You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman.
"
3,6,Cartman,"What?!
"
4,13,Kyle,"Yeah, that'd be faster.
"
5,7,Stan,"Red rocket. Red rocket, Sparky. Red rocket.
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"Eat me, pervert!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih Timmiihh! Timmehuh Timmih Timmiihh!
"
10,8,Stan,"H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Man, that's crap.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Planetariums suck!
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Buenos dias, Señor Presidente, ¿mbien? (Hello, El Presidente)
"
3,13,Stan,"Yeah, dude, but guys just do that. We rip on each other and stuff.
"
17,3,Butters,"Well, at least I'll bet Token's glad it's over with. Aren't you, Token? 
"
4,16,Butters,"But he's playing Spaceman right now. Huh. Hey, Craig! 
"
4,4,Timmy,"Sibilah Sibinlaahh! 
"
15,9,Butters,"Por favor, ehe, I have to get across the border. Mmis amigos, may a-, my amigos are waiting.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Stan, Kenny, can I talk to you guys for a second?  I think we have the counselor and the principal fooled, but we need to talk about Kyle.
"
3,14,Kyle,"Well, you have to hit it softer!
"
11,1,Randy,"Whoa! 
"
1,10,Stan,"A what?
"
6,15,Stan,"Heh hey wait a minute dude.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Hello? We're looking to buy a rooster that can play ""Magic: The Gathering""?
"
10,8,Cartman,"Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan.
"
6,13,Butters,"My movie!  My awesome cool movie. My... precious.
"
3,13,Kyle,"Well, that's a public school. And in it there are children,  just like us.
"
11,11,Butters,"How much further to Castle Sunshine?
"
7,1,Stan,"What is that?
"
11,5,Randy,"Nelson.  Nelson? Nelson, say something.
"
11,6,Stan,"Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that.
"
7,7,Cartman,"Yeah! When the Indians come to tear up our town, we kick 'em in the nuts!
"
8,10,Cartman,"A picture of your mom's boobs?
"
15,7,Stan,"What, oh I don't care, I'm cool with whatever.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Well, Token's really shy, so, I'm just here, sort of on his behalf 'cause, you know.
"
10,10,Stan,"Dude, I really don't see a problem.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Thank you, High Elf of Paragon.
"
4,17,Cartman,"Ey! Why the hell did you have me say that?!
"
6,15,Stan,"Okay, watch, Kyle. Uh, it's an older man, someone very close to you.
"
4,2,Cartman,"I know, huh?
"
5,3,Stan,"His a-miracles?
"
13,1,Kyle,"Aren't those the queermos on the Disney Channel?
"
13,3,Randy,"What's he doing?
"
10,13,Cartman,"Ugh, finally!
"
15,1,Stan,"Okay, the Geniuses will see us now.  Now remember: when you speak to the Geniuses keep your questions short and to the point. The Geniuses do not like those who waste their time. 
"
6,17,Cartman,"Wow!
"
8,9,Randy,"Mr. Garrison! Chef! Jimbo!  Now, come on people! What the hell is wrong with you?! Don't you see what you're all doing?!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! 
"
10,8,Cartman,"Okay, I'm back.
"
10,6,Cartman,"Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?
"
18,7,Butters,"It worked! I'm back in. All systems normal.
"
12,14,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, let's see, uh the right-click is the upper-right...  uhhh, but then what the hell is the...?  Okay kids, I'm gonna need to get some clarification on this. Uh, just keep entering the calculations; I'll be right back, m'kay.
"
1,11,Cartman,"I'm not kissing ass, you stupid slut! 
"
9,2,Kyle,"Yeah, we're pissed off.
"
9,1,Kyle,"Yeah?
"
8,1,Stan,"Just stay still, Butters.
"
13,10,Cartman,"That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!
"
3,5,Stan,"God-damn!
"
4,15,Kyle,"...Alright, that does it!  This has been bothering the hell out of me!  I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!
"
6,2,Stan,"Dude, I'm just happy this whole stupid thing is all over with. 
"
17,7,Stan,"The PS4 has a touchpad interface. You never listened. I told you I thought the PS4 was better, but you never wanted to listen to me, Kyle. You just had your head so set because...  because that's how XBox people are.
"
6,10,Stan,"Ahta. Ah, ahta!
"
8,2,Cartman,"Drrrrrrey drrrrrrrey.  Hey guys, what's going on? Drrrrr.
"
6,15,Stan,"I'm nine years old.
"
16,2,Stan,"I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. 
"
9,8,Stan,"Come on! We've gotta get to the roof! 
"
7,12,Randy,"Well, come on in and sit down, everybody.  You're here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.
"
12,8,Butters,"Huh, invasion pran.
"
1,11,Stan,"That's impossible!
"
5,12,Kyle,"Right.
"
14,9,Cartman,"He's from Jersey, you guys.  Let's just get away from him.
"
2,16,Stan,"What was that?
"
1,13,Kyle,"Woohoo!
"
8,9,Stan,"Dad, what are you doing?!
"
16,8,Cartman,"No, I just don't have the mojo you have, Butters.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Because I, maybe I don't have what it takes to win with-without them!
"
9,3,Kyle,"You think you own the entertainment business, but you don't! Give us back Wing, RIGHT NOW! 
"
9,12,Stan,"So how did I do?
"
14,14,Stan,"Hey no, no. All you people get out of here.
"
2,13,Stan,"Yeah, this line is way too long!
"
4,15,Cartman,"...65, 66, 67... 
"
7,3,Stan,"... Dude, we're not killing Kyle!
"
12,4,Kyle,"Guys, I'm really worried about my brother.
"
9,14,Randy,"Right here is good! Brake pedal! Left pedal!  Alright, get my wheelchair out of the back. 
"
6,12,Kyle,We're all gonna pitch in on an entry!
1,9,Kenny,"(Hunh?) 
"
14,8,Cartman,"I told you I'm serious, Butters.  This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Heh, yeah! That feels real nice! Thanks. 
"
18,10,Kyle,"They picked up my hash tag, Stan! I'm trending!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Dude!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were talkin' here, but I guess you're not talkin' to me. Goodbye.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Really??
"
1,9,Kyle,"...Sorry
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, okay, okay, that's fine.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Oh! Me me, me. Me! Me me! Me! Right here! Right here right here.
"
11,5,Kyle,"It kind of looks like... an egg.
"
6,7,Mr. Garrison,"...What the hell's wrong with him?
"
9,3,Kyle,"Jesus, we made it just in time! 
"
6,9,Kyle,"What??
"
1,9,Wendy,"You guys, look!  It's snowing! 
"
1,11,Stan,"Bluuuuch! 
"
8,3,Stan,"Oh, you've got to be shittin' me. 
"
3,16,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, wait! That doesn't count as our question, does it??
"
7,14,Stan,"I can't believe it. She's in love with somebody else.
"
7,14,Butters,"Waa... ahaaah... 
"
9,3,Stan,"It's a lousy business. I quit.
"
8,13,Cartman,"I'm a psychic and you are worse. I have super-awesome powers and you don't.
"
4,8,Butters,"Wwuhuh-o-kay! 
"
13,1,Cartman,"Your girlfriend's a slut, dude.
"
8,4,Butters,"Loo loo loo, I've got some apples. Loo loo loo, you've got some too. Loo loo loo, I've-
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Hey Shawna.
"
3,6,Kyle,"You bastards!  Hey! There he is! 
"
3,5,Stan,"I think his name is Junjun.
"
3,9,Kyle,"This part kinda sucks, Kenny, but don't screw it up. 
"
14,4,Kyle,"Café World.
"
12,3,Kyle,"Guys, have you seen Kenny?
"
11,10,Cartman,"Thanks for coming, everyone. The big moment is almost here, as soon as Kyle arrives.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster.  But you're my little monster.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Take off the ring? You can take off the ring??)  (Really?)
"
1,9,Cartman,"How do you know?
"
7,9,Butters,"Cheese!
"
6,4,Butters,"Good night, fellas!
"
14,3,Randy,"Yeah well I gotta get to the doctor. 
"
11,3,Stan,"You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
"
16,1,Kyle,"You hear that Clyde?
"
2,10,Kyle,"Do you know anybody with herpes?
"
2,18,Stan,"Wait, look! The helicopter! 
"
7,15,Stan,"No, you're both coming. Do you care about Christmas or not?
"
2,10,Stan,"Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
"
3,3,Stan,"All right. Kyle and I are gonna take our positions up front.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Dude, this is hella cool.
"
16,2,Stan,"It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Oh. O Fortune, how you mock me?
"
1,13,Cartman,"Naive American, Stan, and the bear is very important to my people. 
"
5,5,Stan,"Because, dude, it's Terrance and Phillip.
"
7,9,Cartman,"We're Faith Plus One, Token, there'll be plenty more money. Relax and enjoy, black asshole.  There's hors d'oeuvres and drinks by the Ferris wheel, everyone!  Oh Kyle, guys, so nice to see you!
"
6,16,Stan,"...You're gay?  It's fine if you're gay, Butters. I don't care.
"
10,1,Randy,"Oh, finally! 
"
13,7,Cartman,"Right, and wi-  Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.
"
15,1,Stan,"Come on, it's not that big a deal. Will you just stop resisting and join the rest of us in the future?
"
15,8,Stan,"I feel like total shit.
"
12,7,Butters,"Oh, that's cool.  Well come on, Eric, we need to catch up with everyone.
"
10,14,Stan,"S- hold it a while, okay?
"
2,2,Cartman,"Ooohhh, forget it! 
"
8,10,Stan,"Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.
"
3,3,Cartman,"What what what?
"
6,4,Stan,"What?
"
8,4,Stan,"All right, that's three!
"
14,9,Randy,"Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Okay, well if you have a better idea, then why am I here? 
"
2,4,Kyle,"I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad! 
"
1,5,Stan,"Hi Shelly.
"
15,13,Cartman,"NO!
"
11,13,Stan,"That's it?
"
6,1,Cartman,"Get a hold of yourself, man!
"
3,5,Cartman,"We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend.
"
9,12,Stan,"YOU told me it was a lie!
"
9,13,Butters,"Well, see ya, fella. Uh I've gotta get home before my parents wake up.
"
1,5,Kyle,"I thought you said the wonder of Mother Nature was a beautiful thing.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Alright, then. 
"
16,6,Stan,"Kyle, wake up! You've gotta wake up, Kyle! 
"
9,2,Kyle,"Ugh! Those dirty liars!
"
7,15,Cartman,"Which road?!
"
4,1,Cartman,"I hope I can adjust to life outside of the big house.
"
16,10,Kyle,"Ike found out last night. My mom's having sex with the UPS man.
"
2,14,Kyle,"He’s not dying, Cartman!
"
6,8,Cartman,"Yeah, isn't that the damnedest thing?
"
4,3,Kenny,"(con te io li rivivrт.)
"
11,4,Cartman,"He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
"
11,2,Kyle,"Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't.
"
14,2,Kyle,"Yeah, we wrote that!
"
13,1,Cartman,"I told him... A woman's mouth is the most germ-ridden place on earth, I said. Statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis, I said.
"
11,8,Mr. Mackey,"Uhit's okay, Eric. We understand your illness, m'kay?
"
12,11,Randy,"In there, in there!  Oh God, oh God I'm so startled. Are you startled, Sharon?
"
18,2,Kyle,"Jesus Christ, dude.
"
11,12,Butters,"Santa. Saaanta.
"
13,6,Randy,"Yeah, thanks Stan, I know that.
"
1,8,Kyle,"Wow! Those are some pissed off turkeys!
"
7,15,Kyle,"No.
"
13,14,Kyle,"That doesn't make me feel better! I wouldn't even be able to keep it down.
"
9,12,Stan,"L-look, is this a religion? Because my family is like, Catholic or something.
"
8,9,Cartman,"Hehe. You stupid fools have no idea  that I'm actually working for the Wall-Mart to stop you from succeeding!
"
4,9,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
5,7,Cartman,"Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won't have to resort to violence.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Then don't belittle my people you fuckin' fatass!
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Jimbo, you take some folk and build a big wooden lowercase ""t""! I'll take the rest and get some gas and torches ready!
"
7,8,Stan,"So, I'm watching the season premiere of Boy Meets Boy on television, and then Queer Eye for the Straight Guy comes on, right? So I fall asleep in front of the TV, and when I wake up, I see that I've spilled the Coke I was drinking all over my satin pajama top.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Wow, thanks Eric.
"
13,9,Butters,"So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih.  T-T-Timmih.
"
18,6,Cartman,"Yes.
"
11,12,Cartman,"So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. 
"
3,10,Kyle,"No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll.
"
4,14,Wendy,"Do you think we could make up a good Thanksgiving play in four days?
"
10,13,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people.
"
4,3,Cartman,"Damn, we might be screwed.
"
4,12,Cartman,"We didn't do our homework, Ms. Makesmesick! We didn't feel like it!
"
12,12,Kyle,"Ma'am, please, I think my little brother needs immediate help.
"
14,2,Cartman,"You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.
"
18,3,Wendy,"It's cool. I'll wait.
"
3,4,Cartman,"You just hit each other, smack each other around. 
"
1,8,Cartman,"What?!
"
12,6,Stan,"All right!
"
9,9,Stan,"So what do you suggest?
"
2,5,Mr. Mackey,"Th-the school could put out pamphlets, m'kay? And we could have seminars to educate, m'kay?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Hey, stop it!
"
1,11,Cartman,"Hey Wendy, seriously, you need to stop with this whole jealousy thing!
"
14,3,Cartman,"NO!  Oh God, oh God it's so good.
"
5,3,Stan,"That's it? That's how you did that trick?
"
10,14,Stan,"All right, fine, go ahead.
"
2,15,Stan,"Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care.
"
2,16,Randy,"Eh, it's fine with me.
"
10,9,Stan,"All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Is Kyle laughing out there!? This isn't a time for funny jokes, I'm gonna die!
"
16,12,Mr. Mackey,"Hokay everyone, it's time to start the costume contest. m'kay.
"
6,2,Stan,"All right dude, if I race you will you leave me alone?
"
9,14,Randy,"What seems to be the officer, problem?
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Aghh!)
"
13,11,Cartman,"Zzzzt zzzzsssht!  Dude, they won't rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out.
"
3,13,Kyle,"Uh, hi. Is, uh, is Rebecca home?
"
2,4,Cartman,"What the hell is gahekgafuga?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell is going on??
"
5,2,Randy,"Well, we'va all learned an important lesson. That just because somebody's gay doesn't mean they're gonna molest children. Straight people do that too.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Then I can give it to my dad. 
"
13,7,Cartman,"You guys cannot leave the pirate club now! How can you not want to stay in this paradise we've created?! In Somalia, people have no laws! They have no rules! And they never grow old!
"
6,5,Kyle,"Yeah, they want everyone to stick around and watch more of this retarded show.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Switching to secondary fuel line.  What's that?
"
4,12,Stan,"We got you covered, Timmy.
"
2,4,Kyle,"I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
"
8,10,Butters,"U-Ah, gee-whiz, Trent. Ah, I don't wanna get involved. Or else my parents will ground me.
"
5,10,Stan,"What?
"
4,2,Kyle,"Sometimes I think I can see time slowing down,  and my own existence fading.
"
4,14,Kyle,"It's a turkey.  His name is Gobbles.
"
1,8,Cartman,"Get out of the way mah! The Terrance and Phillip Thanksgiving Special is on.
"
4,2,Stan,"Jesus Christ, why did we pick the fat guy to lift up in there?
"
15,5,Cartman,"After you. 
"
11,7,Kyle,"Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!
"
4,6,Cartman,"Lardbut. Oh, that's so mature! Golly, I guess I was wrong about you guys, huh?!
"
13,3,Kyle,"Aww, come on!
"
15,10,Butters,"Biggest story about who?
"
6,8,Stan,"Um, cool.
"
6,16,Stan,"Dude!
"
11,5,Kyle,"You swore on the cross, fatso!
"
14,6,Cartman,"What?
"
1,12,Stan,"Ugh. I don't know how much more I can take, dude.
"
9,14,Randy,"I could die waiting in this line, Stan. Come on, let's go!  Heeey heh, Josh Garrett. How you doin'?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"But the talent show is tomorrow!  Ooo!
"
1,5,Cartman,"Gah, French people piss me off.
"
13,3,Jimmy,"Hey, what's the matter, Kyle? You seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Come on, brothers and sistersWe've all got to join togetherJoin together and give me moneySo I can buy more Chinpokomon!We've got to stop this fight and...
"
16,9,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm fat and I'm pissed!
"
2,18,Stan,"Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!
"
2,12,Stan,"Wow. Clubhouses are magical.
"
1,11,Wendy,"Oh. Hi, Stan.  I think it worked, Bebe.
"
18,10,Cartman,"These guys are such blumpkin catchers.
"
3,5,Kyle,"Cartman! Wait!
"
10,8,Stan,"Hurry dude!
"
1,4,Cartman,"Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.
"
9,5,Randy,"Well somebody had to put that knucklehead in his place.
"
2,13,Stan,"How's he doing?
"
8,3,Cartman,"If I knew where Mel Gibson was, I'd be down on the floor licking his balls at this very moment, sir. All I know is he lives somewhere in Malibu. Now stop wasting me and Mel Gibson's time, you little wussy prick.
"
8,4,Stan,"No.
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"Thank you, Mayor. I don't wanna sound like a dickhole, but I-
"
2,10,Cartman,"Ugh. Uunnh.  Ey, give me that!  Ahhhh...
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"Because it's Christmas???
"
2,17,Stan,"Dude, why are you taking Tweek's underpants?
"
3,3,Kyle,"Well, we've got something to tell you about Veronica, Chef!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Yeah. Yeah, I'm real excited. REAL excited... for some reason... Oh, Jesus! What's wrong with me?
"
4,12,Cartman,"Haha, Teacher, we're traveling back in time to third grade!-God-damnit you guys, you seriously said this time you'd snap into it with me.
"
13,10,Kyle,"Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?
"
2,13,Kyle,"You've gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?
"
12,2,Stan,"Butters, don't be such a pussy.
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)
"
2,11,Kyle,"Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing.
"
16,14,Kyle,"But... they were here. Ah I swear it. Stacks and stacks of ballots from states all over the country!
"
9,13,Kyle,"Yeah... He must be really sick.  Hang on Willzy-x. There's still hope. Stan and Craig might still luck with the space program down in Mexico.
"
1,9,Cartman,"I'm not fat, I'm festively plump.
"
7,3,Cartman,"My consciences just caught up with me.
"
9,11,Cartman,"We're fine, thanks.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Helloo thear! The name is Eric P Cartman. I'm a well-respected owner in the slave trade.
"
2,5,Stan,"Oh, yeah. Eeww.
"
8,3,Kenny,"(Goddamn.)
"
2,10,Kyle,"Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!
"
1,6,Randy,"How's it feel to be 102, paps?
"
10,7,Cartman,"Seriously! Mom-
"
5,4,Stan,"This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman.
"
12,13,Stan,"Aww!
"
1,7,Stan,"Oh.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Wing? Wing?
"
1,13,Cartman,"It was you all along. You were with my mother the night of the Drunken Barn Dance!
"
1,2,Cartman,"BEEFCAKE!
"
18,10,Kyle,"Bill Cosby.
"
9,10,Cartman,"I tried to cover it up, tried to put it back together with modeling glue, tried to seal it with a soldering gun, but, I give up. I can't hide it, I broke the egg.
"
1,12,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
3,5,Kyle,"Shut up!!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hello hello, are you still there?
"
18,8,Cartman,"This isn't even a fight. This is just... a slaughter.
"
16,12,Randy,"Shelly come on!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"See ya tomorrow at the bake sale, fellas.
"
14,4,Randy,"Oh cool! Okay. 
"
6,4,Stan,"I said that's far enough!  Don't be scared, little baby cow. We're here to set you loose.  There you go. You're free. Run away!  Go! They're gonna murder you.
"
7,3,Cartman,"I just thought we should find a private place to... talk.
"
2,10,Kyle,"We gave you guys herpes.
"
15,4,Cartman,"They're trying to stir up some big thing again, get all the girls all heated up - freaking out - over which boy has the biggest schlong! This has to be dealt with!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Happy holidays, everyone!  Enjoy the rest of your lives with CartmanBrah.
"
2,2,Cartman,"No! Don't!
"
13,11,Stan,"It seems like everyone has an attitude of ""that's just the way they are"" or ""that's just the way it is""! Nobody likes it, but everybody's too busy to do anything about it!
"
4,9,Cartman,"So?
"
15,9,Cartman,"He's trying a simple diversion tactic, thinks we're stupid.  Haha! You're gonna have to do better than that, Mexican!
"
8,5,Butters,"AWESOM-O, what are you doing? My friends are waiting for their beverages. Chop chop! 
"
8,8,Butters,"Uh hey, wait a minute! 
"
7,13,Stan,"Daaaad!
"
8,11,Cartman,"They call it cough syrup, cough medicine, cold and flu remedy. But behind closed doors at South Park Elementary it also has a street name. Coochie, wombat juice, tigger yum yum. Hello, I'm Rick Cartman. Today, the Sexy Action School News Team takes you inside the dark and lonely world... of cough medicine abuse.
"
2,13,Kyle,"You dumbass, Cartman!
"
6,4,Stan,"Ah, hold on.  It's some negotiator named Mike. What do I do?
"
11,9,Randy,"You're welcome.  And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning.
"
18,1,Kyle,"You okay, bro?
"
7,14,Butters,"This place is awesome!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Now, the next mouth.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Are you fucking serious? 
"
18,5,Cartman,"Okay okay okay. Come inside, there's drones out here. 
"
4,17,Kenny,"(Yeah, right! Awesome!)
"
5,7,Kyle,"""AAAAAAAH!"" 
"
3,2,Cartman,"Yes. And when I get down from here, I'm gonna kick you both right in the nuts.
"
5,3,Kyle,"You bastards! 
"
8,2,Jimmy,"S-s-seven!
"
1,11,Stan,"They don't have a fireplace here; we shouldn't be making love yet.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys. Look!  They do have an amazing fountain. 
"
5,1,Stan,"Yeah. We all gotta make sure it doesn't come back.
"
2,14,Stan,"Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich.
"
2,8,Cartman,"I don't wanna.
"
10,6,Kyle,"C-Cartman?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Kyle! Hey, Kyle!  I know what you're thinking, Kyle. That, like, this is some kind of fitting comeuppance.
"
16,5,Kyle,"Well, then you gotta ride it out, Butters.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Come on in, everybody. Lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside.  Great to see you all. What a terrific audience.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I'll just... be going up to bed now.  Gueh... guess maybe I won't even wear those boxers.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles, hahahahahaha.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"I got you, Nut Gobbler! 
"
5,8,Stan,"But Mom...
"
9,5,Kyle,"No more boring baseball until next year!
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"What the... 
"
8,10,Cartman,"Nononono, you gotta go  ""But Mo-o-o-om.""
"
3,13,Kyle,"I'm not completely sure.
"
9,3,Stan,"You guys, we're gonna lose our client. 
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh, Mr. Garrison?
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Uh--)
"
9,11,Stan,"The hell do they want? 
"
5,11,Kyle,"Hello, I'm Kyle's cousin Kyle.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
16,9,Kyle,"You got Randy Newman to do the theme song. You're not trying that hard. Token, you're a good kid. How can you sit there and collect money on a show that's about a, about a fat child killing himself?? Where's your sense of shame??
"
5,5,Stan,"Ah, well, we were thinking how cool it would be if you and Terrance got back together for a reunion and-
"
2,13,Cartman,"Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money.  Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!
"
4,15,Kenny,"(Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)
"
4,1,Kyle,"Yeah, why don't you go eat some more pork rinds or something, you fat fuck?! 
"
3,1,Kenny,"(This sounds fucking screwed.) 
"
7,11,Kyle,"Yes. Three friends. You're not my friend.
"
2,17,Stan,"Hey there, little guy.
"
2,9,Stan,"Dude!
"
2,13,Kyle,"But ih-
"
1,12,Kyle,"Aagh! For Christ's sake, Cartman, when was the last time you changed your socks?
"
6,9,Kyle,"Alright, fine!  You're the spokesman, Cartman! But you'd better not screw it up!
"
9,11,Kyle,"Huh. Whaaa?  Where are we? 
"
9,10,Stan,"Oh no, dude, he's gonna put me with Wendy.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Keep looking. Sometimes it takes your eyes a minute to adjust.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Oh no! It's that  super-sad Sarah McLachlan commercial! Look away!
"
13,14,Cartman,"You know, there's always like five or six minorities wearing their T-shirts in the wave pool, pisses me off.
"
9,12,Kyle,"Oh dude, check it out. I got a Jake Plummer.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Well what are you saying? That, that you don't really love Christ??
"
3,17,Stan,"Why?! Don't you know?!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Ey! Seriously!
"
5,9,Stan,"Oh... Well, I guess, maybe, someday, we can learn to... hate you too.
"
8,4,Stan,"Dude, my car sucks. I gotta get a new one. 
"
14,8,Butters,"I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Token, Token, got a question for you:  Token, do you like fishsticks?
"
18,2,Wendy,"Right, and when things change or things come up, you don't forget about everything you promised people!
"
3,7,Cartman,"This is bullcrap!  I can't reach the freezer!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"I just don't understand it, Dad. It's like, nobody cares about winning their comedy awards. The only people who showed up were me and Tyler Perry.
"
8,5,Butters,"Boy, Los Angeles is great, huh AWESOM-O? Can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas?
"
2,11,Stan,"That's a haiku?
"
17,10,Wendy,"Not lately, no.
"
4,2,Stan,"...Hey, you can't do that!
"
6,10,Kyle,"Dude, look at Bebe.  Something seems different about her.
"
16,9,Kyle,"I just don't know what to do. I mean, I hate Cartman with all my heart, but I can't stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him. But should I feel ashamed? Oh, whatever lowered the bar is not my fault. So if I kind of go with it, is it really unfair to Cartman?
"
1,13,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell are you talking about, Eric?
"
11,8,Kyle,"You sure you don't wanna back out?
"
10,2,Kyle,"So... what do you do for fun?
"
14,5,Randy,"Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.
"
17,10,Butters,"Well alright, but if you try to punch me, I'll scream! 
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Come on!) 
"
5,7,Cartman,"I'm milking the dog. They make dog milk.
"
2,14,Mr. Mackey,"Whooaa..!
"
5,9,Stan,"You've gotta listen to me! We're not spies! 
"
9,1,Kyle,"Well, do you also do other surgeries like that?
"
6,1,Stan,"Then City Wok could say their food makes them lose weight.
"
14,14,Randy,"You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan?
"
15,8,Kyle,"Yeah, it's fine.
"
1,3,Kyle,"Dude, I don't understand hunting at all.
"
5,5,Kyle,"I didn't see you complaining at the time, fat boy!
"
6,7,Butters,"Cartman?
"
14,1,Butters,"Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush.
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"Well, boys, it's obvious to me that you didn't do your work, and that you stayed up all night thinking up some ridiculous lie.
"
10,9,Jimmy,"Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Shhh. Willzy-x, don't say anything. We're gonna bust you out of here.
"
5,8,Stan,"Dude, we got GameSphere.
"
17,6,Cartman,"Oh, looks like most everyone's here. Um, wasn't there something you wanted to say, Kyle? Remember about the...?
"
17,6,Kyle,"I just do, Stan.
"
15,8,Stan,"What?
"
8,4,Stan,"But Dad, I don't know how to dance or nothin'.
"
6,9,Stan,"Don't watch the movie, you guys. It'll be terrible. Close your eyes! 
"
10,4,Kyle,"Ow. Quit it!
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Now here we can see the interior female anatomy. Things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside
"
9,14,Cartman,"You know, Stan, I'd say your dad racksa disciprine!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Yeah, pretty much.
"
6,5,Stan,"Shelly, we're watching that! Go back!
"
2,10,Cartman,"""I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool.""  Mom, answer that! ""They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool."" 
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, I'll click on family issues. What time did you want counseling?
"
2,16,Stan,"Hooray! Uh, I mean, wait. What?
"
7,13,Stan,"Hwat??
"
18,3,Mr. Garrison,"Cisgender. It's the politically correct name for people who aren't transgender. If you identify with the sex you were born with, then you're cis.
"
17,7,Randy,"Nobody else has thought of it, Sharon. I won't even be out in the crowd. I'll be on the inside when the doors open. While everyone is trying to run over each other, I'll turn around and run right into the stores. I'll be the first to get whatever I want!
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, guys. Let's all play a game of ""grab ass.""
"
4,15,Stan,"Oh, you guys!
"
1,8,Kyle,"Yeah, she's fatter than Cartman.
"
17,7,Kyle,"Larry and Brad Stoltsky
"
4,2,Kyle,"Right. You're Timmy.
"
1,1,Stan,"Bleech!
"
12,6,Randy,"Thank you Gerald. 
"
3,8,Stan,"Get a hold of yourself, man!
"
1,6,Cartman,"Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Kenny? Kenny?  Kenny?  Wanna look at Playboy?  Wanna, wanna get high sniffin' paint? Kenny?
"
4,9,Stan,"Dad!
"
1,1,Stan,"I think it's part of a Cheesy Poof. 
"
12,2,Kyle,"A hundred thousand for a picture of Britney peeing on a ladybug. Imagine what a photo of her crapping on a squirrel is worth!
"
4,16,Stan,"Come on, you guys! Our parents are gonna be back any minute!
"
6,13,Butters,"Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!
"
16,2,Cartman,"Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!
"
13,14,Kyle,"Oh who pees in the shower?
"
10,8,Stan,"Kyle, you have to keep playing.
"
8,11,Cartman,"All right, Butters, keep your eyes open.
"
13,14,Kyle,"All right, what do you guys wanna ride first?
"
6,10,Wendy,"Slut.
"
1,6,Stan,"Are you ready grampa?
"
4,1,Stan,"Cartman, why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime?! We're gonna lose to girls because of you!
"
6,9,Kyle,"No. NOO!!
"
7,6,Butters,"Well I don't have nothin' to confess. Honestly.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Good man. Any luck here?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Huh.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh-- What the hell is going on?!
"
14,14,Kyle,"Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
"
16,3,Kenny,"(I'm sorry guys. Faith Hilling is just a stupid fad, right?)
"
10,4,Cartman,"Well well well! 
"
18,5,Butters,"You know, those drone thingies. You can make it fly anywhere and shoot video and stuff.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you'll be!
"
4,1,Cartman,"I know. That's why I have to have them up my ass.  Shut up, you guys! It's not funny!
"
6,13,Cartman,"And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.
"
13,4,Cartman,"Let's get to my house!! 
"
7,10,Randy,"Well, Stan, it's a very fragile issue.
"
11,5,Randy,"No! Listen! We aren't rabbits!  Oof.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Hey! Hey, those Jonas Brothers are assholes!
"
11,13,Stan,"Nice to meet you!  I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday.
"
14,9,Stan,"You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
"
3,10,Kyle,"Shit!
"
2,15,Cartman,"He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.
"
10,6,Kyle,"You see anything, Kenny??
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, Mr. Garrison, Sr.?
"
11,10,Cartman,"O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?!  Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?
"
7,1,Kyle,"What?? Who cancelled us?
"
1,1,Wendy,"Eww!
"
9,9,Cartman,"God only knows the horrors that go on in girls' slumber parties. Let's just hope Butters can survive it.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Oohh, morning, hum, hmyeah. HWAA!  That son of a bitch!
"
3,12,Kenny,"(Awww.)
"
4,12,Stan,"Alright.  Hey, listen up everybody!  We need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves! Let's all do something radical! 
"
9,8,Randy,"That's not important right now, son. What's important is figuring out whose fault this is. 
"
2,14,Stan,"Boy, do we!
"
9,11,Cartman,"You're welcome, now leave us alone!!  Now! Let the extermination begin!  We will start... with the daywalker!
"
18,5,Butters,"When did you put Craig's mom's bush on the Internet?!
"
2,18,Kyle,"No, he sure doesn't.
"
12,3,Cartman,"Hiding cats?  Why, that would be illegal. 
"
18,9,Stan,"Dude, video games are meant to be played in a living room, not something to watch people comment on!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Welcome... to the special ed department's... first annual comedy awards.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Oh, we're just makin' a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg. We figure that way it'll be easier to keep safe so we can get an A.
"
11,13,Stan,"You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-
"
14,11,Stan,"Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.
"
4,11,Cartman,"For he is Lord, he is Lord... Bring up the next person!  This boy has been crippled with sin-uh. But I hear God saying that this boy will walk!
"
17,8,Cartman,"The men are just inexperience, Sir Kyle. They need more training.
"
6,8,Butters,"Compassionate.
"
12,8,Butters,"What?
"
11,12,Cartman,"Don't try to change the subject, Kyle.  You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Dude, screw this place! We've gotta go to Super Phun Thyme!
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Now, does anybody know what sexual harassment means?  Yes, Eric?
"
8,3,Cartman,"Thank you, thank you very much. Now, in order to do what we  all know needs to be done, we are first going to need more support. I think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see The Passion.
"
9,13,Stan,"What?
"
2,7,Kyle,"Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?
"
3,16,Kyle,"Dude, I don't think 8-year olds are supposed to take hormones.
"
12,12,Randy,"What are you? A McCain voter?
"
18,3,Cartman,"Yeah, just go with it, Wendy, cisginger bitch! Of course, being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me. I might have to approve certain aspects of this... solitary location.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Well it-... it's okay. there's no denying it all worked out for the best this time a-.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now.
"
16,3,Kyle,"How can we be passé? We're only in 4th grade.
"
13,12,Stan,"God damn it God damn it!
"
9,11,Kyle,"It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech! People aren't creeped out by gingers!
"
2,7,Kyle,"Worse than this?
"
3,3,Stan,"What the hell does that mean?
"
1,1,Kyle,"No, Ike, go home.
"
4,6,Kyle,"What?
"
3,3,Stan,"A demon from Hell sent to suck the life out of men!
"
1,13,Kyle,"Yeah, with butterscotch. 
"
1,11,Kyle,"Where's your present, Cartman?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!
"
18,9,Wendy,"And why do you think young people-?
"
10,9,Kyle,"You knew this whole time? Why?
"
11,10,Cartman,"You signed an agreement, Kyle!!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Hey, take it easy Colonel.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Hey, there you are! 
"
6,10,Cartman,"Well, I'm glad you guys all agree. And so, Kyle, I just wanna say that it's been really great, and we're gonna miss you.
"
12,14,Stan,"No, I'm on the Japanese side.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Very funny, Eric! Kenny's dead!
"
5,1,Cartman,"Oh-Ho, gross!
"
3,5,Stan,"No, he's annoying.
"
4,4,Cartman,"Did you guys see that?
"
6,10,Cartman,"Yes Mom?
"
16,5,Cartman,"I have balls.
"
9,9,Wendy,"I think we went too far with Marjorine.
"
8,11,Butters,"Nu-noo, not yet. I've been standin' out in front of the school for about ...two hours now and ah, and I haven't seen any celebrities. Uh, about thirty minutes ago I thought I saw Sigourney Weaver, but ih-ih-turn- it turns out it was a dead horse.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Aw dude, look, there's Craig! Heheh.  Craig's mom is taking off her clothes.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Haahahaha, we have the device now! The power belongs to us! 
"
7,3,Mr. Mackey,"Come on, Kenny, let's go, 'k? 
"
2,8,Kyle,"Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
"
8,4,Stan,"I, I don't know. He seems all right.
"
1,11,Wendy,"NO I'M NOT ACTING LIKE A FREEEAK!!! 
"
7,11,Butters,"How many survivors are there? You should all come down here.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Or a really sweet one. 
"
6,12,Randy,"What? 
"
12,7,Cartman,"You can let go now, Butters.
"
1,5,Stan,"…So remember, Shelly's the one with the big wire coming out of her mouth and a metal plate on her back.  When you see Shelly, kick her ass.  Shelly bad, Shelly very bad.
"
5,6,Cartman,"...Alright, so listen: All I want you to do is keep anybody out who tries to get in here. If you see anybody on my propertih, especially Stan and Kyle, you are to shoot on sight!
"
7,5,Stan,"Look, we're not going in there, so just-! Wait, why the hell am I talking to your hand?  Look, we're not going in there, so just knock it off!
"
10,11,Randy,"...Smalls.  No way!
"
18,2,Wendy,"You wanna dance? 
"
17,9,Kyle,"This would have never happened if you would have let Kenny be a princess in the first place!
"
7,9,Kyle,"Oh.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!
"
1,4,Cartman,"That's not fair!
"
1,7,Cartman,"You what?! Are you insane?!
"
3,6,Kyle,"No you're not, dude! You're a guy in a panda costume! 
"
13,12,Stan,"But then why are you acting like such fags? I don't understand.
"
2,5,Kyle,"No. No-it looked dead.
"
13,1,Stan,"Listen, Kenny, we need to talk about your new girlfriend.
"
7,8,Cartman,"That's right. Proud. You know what I think, guys? I think we should have a metrosexual pride parade.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Tango tango tango! We've got it! Let's get it to the containment center! Go! 
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, you sure? Because I'm here when you need me.
"
4,4,Stan,"He doesn't have to do homework?
"
14,4,Kyle,"I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. 
"
16,6,Kyle,"The stop drinking Double Dew, fatass!
"
5,8,Kyle,"Don't know, but it kicks ass.  Wow, dude, you're the luckiest kid in South Park.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Ruh really? Wow, you would help me even though I'm crippled. You are caring and not fat. 
"
7,12,Stan,"I'm not hanging around that kid anymore.
"
4,17,Kyle,"We wish- 
"
3,17,Cartman,"How about this one, Kenny? 
"
13,14,Butters,"Hawww, you lived?
"
13,7,Kyle,"They never grow old because they die before they're 30!
"
9,8,Stan,"No! I broke the fucking dam!
"
4,10,Kyle,"Mister Father!  We have to ask you something.
"
18,7,Butters,"HA! I can almost feel his balls on my fist!  Haha! How do you like that, Dad?!
"
2,2,Cartman,"--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard...
"
11,1,Stan,"Token! Hey, wait up.  I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that ""little person"" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word.
"
5,14,Butters,"Wuh comin', Dad! 
"
3,12,Stan,"W-we weren't scared!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Nothin', it's cool.
"
16,1,Cartman,"This is unbelievable. Stupid Toilet Safety Administration. You can't even take a crap at IHOP without a forty minute line!
"
2,8,Stan,"Oh gosh, killed Kenny!
"
6,14,Cartman,"Look, a covetous Jew!
"
1,12,Kyle,"Whoa, that was cool!
"
3,10,Cartman,"Uh... no, that's okay, Mom.
"
12,13,Stan,"Dude, what did I tell you?! You have to be tough and stand up for yourself!  Mr. Garrett, Mr. Garrett.  This kid wants to join the basketball team. He's really good.
"
15,11,Randy,"Oh, that is beautiful!
"
15,2,Kyle,"No problem, Funnybot.
"
4,17,Kenny,"(Nooo!!) 
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"...And Mr. Twig is at home; he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history.
"
12,11,Randy,"Jesus, they can't kill it!  What do you think about the Guineasaurus Rex, Shelly?  Oh that's good. There, there's Shelly with the Guineasaurus Rex in the background. Give, give a little peace sign, Shelly.  Oh I know, hold out your palm so it looks like you're holding the Guineasaurus Rex. Shelly?
"
15,10,Stan,"Please, can this wait? A big story is about to about to come out on Eavesdropper and we have the only way to stop it!
"
6,7,Cartman,"Takin' a look here.  Seems like quality stuff you got here, Frances. Yeah, good texture, nice consistency. Sea men must be alive and healthy in there. I'll take five.
"
7,9,Kyle,"This is the worst day of my life.
"
15,4,Kyle,"No they didn't.
"
18,5,Butters,"Let me see!
"
10,10,Cartman,"Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?
"
15,11,Randy,"Sup brah?!
"
2,9,Cartman,"All of us?
"
6,12,Stan,"What??
"
7,7,Kyle,"The odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one.  That means, with a ten thousand dollar bet, you win three hundred and fifty thousand.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Atone?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is s'posed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids, m'kay.
"
3,7,Cartman,"You're not allowed to have people over!
"
6,17,Cartman,"Oh, that's so lame of them. 
"
9,14,Kyle,"I think his pants are falling down.
"
5,5,Stan,"Uuuuhh.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Man, this is stupid.
"
2,7,Stan,"Dude, the road is always snowy.
"
10,12,Cartman,"Oh God!
"
4,16,Stan,"The police?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Butters, w-where is everybody?
"
5,9,Stan,"I told you: those Afghan kids just wanted to give us something back for giving them four dollars.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Doo-uhh.
"
10,11,Cartman,"How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
"
10,7,Cartman,"And what exactly keeps me on the stool?
"
8,5,Butters,"I love to brush my teeth! In the mornin' and at night!
To keep 'em white and healthy, I got to brush them all the time!
"
3,14,Randy,"We're out of s'more schnapps?
"
11,12,Butters,"What powers? Ah I don't understand.
"
13,2,Kyle,"...Dude, what?!
"
9,14,Kyle,"Dude, we've gotta hurry home! The final episode of Lost is on soon. 
"
3,10,Kyle,"Neither do I. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"My own amusement park, Mother. I'm sure.
"
9,4,Stan,"Yeah, the lawyer lost that page.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!!  Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! 
"
15,10,Cartman,"Yup, a few more laxatives on that one, a little more Arby's horsey sauce on there, mhm.
"
8,2,Cartman,"Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics.  Bull's eye!
"
6,2,Butters,"Wuh, that's my face, sir.
"
6,13,Butters,"The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.
"
14,14,Stan,"Can I have a Pop Tart?
"
16,12,Randy,"Last week, I saw it was up for sale. On a fluke I asked how much. $10,000! Can you believe it?! We have the entire business! And we can watch movies whenever we want! Come on, you guys wanna see it?
"
5,13,Butters,"Eh, just about.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Woohoo!!! 
"
7,12,Randy,"All right, that does it. From now on, our family is Mormon!
"
7,1,Kyle,"And then we won't have to show anybody the picture Kenny has of you guys sucking each other's jagons.
"
12,12,Kyle,"Hang in there, Ike. We're gonna get you help.
"
3,5,Cartman,"I like going to school now. Jakovasaurs are so cool. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Hurry up in there!
"
9,11,Stan,"You buying school lunch today?
"
7,10,Cartman,"My God, he's right.  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, even though I walk through the valley of death.  Guys, I don't know if I ever told you this, but, well, I love you guys.  Except for you, Kyle.
"
18,7,Cartman,"It's okay. Everything is cool. Don't let anyone mess with your head, and it's all going to be fine. You're cool, Eric. You're cool. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"What?
"
4,6,Kyle,"See? I told you, dude. Those are dialysis machines.  Old people have to hook themselves into it with a tube, and it sucks all their body fluids out.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!
"
6,9,Kyle,"No, dude. They only changed ""terrorist"" to ""hippie"" to make E.T. more P.C.
"
15,5,Cartman,"I'm volunteering.
"
7,10,Cartman,"Yeah, but like, eight of them were hippies. Mostly hippies go to farmer's markets. Mostly.
"
9,12,Stan,"Excuse me?
"
13,14,Randy,"Sharon, the water park had a pee meltdown! They think a lot of people have died.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? ""Big titties! Buttmunch!"" There's no walls anymore! ""Shit!"" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. ""I wet my bed last night."" 
"
6,13,Stan,"Good job, wizard.
"
8,4,Stan,"My friends, I think we have ourselves a dance troupe.
"
8,14,Stan,"Aw- awww!
"
7,14,Stan,"Hey, can I join in? 
"
18,3,Randy,"Sorry. Sorry, yeah. Coming. 
"
6,16,Stan,"Butters, part of being on an adventure is you go places you're not supposed to go. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Well, Kyle, maybe I was just trying to prove a p-
"
4,15,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, that's fantastic, m'kay?!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
2,12,Cartman,"What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?  Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?
"
15,13,Stan,"That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?
"
14,4,Cartman,"Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you.
"
1,7,Cartman,"Finish her dude, she's a zombie now!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, today we're going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku. A haiku is just like a normal American poem, except that it doesn't rhyme, and it's totally stupid. For example- Uh, where is Eric Cartman?
"
7,6,Cartman,"Yeah! This was our hot lead!
"
18,1,Kenny,"(Yahoo!) 
"
16,10,Kyle,"Nobody wants any of your stuff, you fat bitch!
"
4,3,Kenny,"(...partirт.)
"
11,3,Kyle,"All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test.
"
10,4,Kyle,"Sir! Mister television executive! Stop!
"
12,4,Kyle,"If they give you something small, will you end the strike?
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Dude, what does that mean?
"
13,7,Cartman,"Nobody's goin' anywhere!! I'm the captain of this outfit!  To arms!  Now, is there any question who's in charge? I have an enire pirate crew willing to do anything for me!
"
10,3,Cartman,"YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
"
9,4,Cartman,"Well... well then he's NOT alive.
"
15,8,Stan,"Just stop it! You people are so full of shit!
"
2,12,Cartman,"A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!
"
11,7,Stan,"That was a sweet idea, Kyle. 
"
7,8,Stan,"We're metrosexual!!
"
6,13,Randy,"The video sandwich?
"
5,7,Kyle,"Yeah. I've changed mine three times already 'cause it itches so much.
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh God! I hate cannibals!
"
10,3,Kyle,"Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!
"
10,13,Cartman,"Come on in, Bob.  All right, just let me use my tools... 
"
14,4,Stan,"Delete Profile! ""Are you totally sure? Yes or-"" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete!  Hey dad?  Dad?  Oh dude, what the fuck? 
"
1,9,Kyle,"Say something, Mr. Hankey! 
"
16,13,Kyle,"Did you do it?
"
2,8,Kyle,"Yup. 
"
2,18,Cartman,"Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar bop me in the face and see if it hurts. Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've got!  Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch! 
"
10,9,Kyle,"Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Yeah dude, there's lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.
"
3,1,Stan,"AAAAAAA! 
"
1,3,Stan,"You weren't in Vietnam, Cartman.
"
2,12,Wendy,"Yeah, Stan.
"
4,6,Kyle,"Dude. You have sex with children.
"
1,9,Kyle,"What's that?
"
10,9,Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Rocket ships?
"
2,9,Kyle,"Well, I'm sure it was him.
"
6,1,Stan,"Wait. Everyone hates Jared now?
"
2,10,Kyle,"Someone who wants a favor.
"
2,6,Stan,"Okay, when I yell ""action"", you start to walk this way,  then Kenny's going to pull the plastic frog in front of you, and you have to be scared.
"
4,1,Stan,"Yeah. You know, they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity.
"
17,9,Kyle,"No. They're not a part of your betrayal?
"
6,15,Stan,"Kyle! Kyle!
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"All right everyone, thank you all for comin' out to protest the war, m'kay? .
"
9,7,Jimmy,"She's apparently gotten real good with baking cakes with keys in them. 
"
7,9,Stan,"What??
"
8,9,Cartman,"Wait! Guys! Hold on! I wanna go with you and help out.
"
14,4,Stan,"Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
"
8,14,Kyle,"Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!
"
7,4,Randy,"He's right.  Boy, do I feel like a fool. 
"
15,10,Cartman,"You aren't listing to anythin-  Make it worth my while how?
"
13,3,Kyle,"I can't just hide my whole life, Butters. And besides, I have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"A what?
"
2,12,Stan,"Huh-I dunno.
"
12,3,Stan,"You guys! Check it out.  It's Kenny.  Isn't that great? He's just getting high on life.
"
11,14,Cartman,"I'm better-looking than you!  The girls think I'm better-looking than you, Kyle!
"
2,9,Stan,"What was that? 
"
1,4,Kyle,"Who's that?
"
10,6,Kyle,"They saw us on the tour.  Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?
"
4,8,Cartman,"Cool.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Student atholetes. Hoho, that is brilliant sahr. Now, when we sell their likeness for video games, how do we get around payin' for our slaves uh- ""student atheletes"" then?
"
6,1,Kyle,"Okay, it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip.
"
7,5,Kyle,"...And in conclusion, the Latino community has provided America, and indeed, the entire world with innovations that we would be lost without. And that is my presentation on the role of Hispanics in American technology. Thank you. 
"
18,10,Randy,"My daughter... She has no idea that I'm Lorde... I can't let her find out from the Internet. I have to tell her the truth before we all tell the world.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!
"
6,13,Stan,"Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!
"
18,2,Stan,"Huh? Why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says? 
"
8,11,Cartman,"What is that butthole doing now?!
"
8,13,Cartman,"No, please! I'm sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Go, Tweek. Kick his ass! Get him!
"
9,4,Kyle,"That dirty no-good sonofabitch!
"
16,8,Randy,"Get in the car, Stan! We're going home!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Yeah! 
"
2,13,Kyle,"No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!  Get up!  Get UP! 
"
5,4,Stan,"We don't wanna see them, Cartman! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Next!
"
9,9,Butters,"Hi Dad.
"
9,5,Cartman,"That was no strike, that was a terrible pitch! You need some Goddamned lasik surgery!
"
7,13,Kyle,"Oh no...
"
16,6,Cartman,"No, I didn't get herpes, I just had a cold sore.
"
9,13,Cartman,"Killer. 
"
14,2,Stan,"Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!
"
2,15,Kyle,"I don't know.  Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again.
"
6,12,Kenny,(Okay!) 
9,1,Kyle,"Coach! Coach, I'm all better. I'm ready to play.
"
16,3,Kyle,"What, you been living under a rock? This is the new meme, Cat Taylor Swift Reporting.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Okay Token, what are your feelings about that?
"
2,18,Stan,"I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
"
6,13,Kyle,"We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
"
7,7,Stan,"What can I do?
"
1,5,Kyle,"Couple of days?  But Terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Oh it's a relief, huh?! Well guess what, Butters! If I'm the one trapped in virtual reality, that means you're nothing but a computer program!
"
5,7,Cartman,"Butters, will you stop ff-fili-bustering?
"
10,8,Jimmy,"We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!
"
10,14,Stan,"I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
"
15,7,Stan,"Oh dude dude wait, I'm sorry.
"
6,16,Randy,"Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and ...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but... Well son, pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and... It's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or... being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at anything.
"
10,14,Stan,"Hey, can they do that??
"
18,9,Wendy,"...Why do you think young people are responding to this?  I'm asking you a question! 
"
10,9,Cartman,"For Show and Tell today I have brought...  ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!..  behind the 9/11 attacks! 
"
12,14,Butters,"Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing?  I- I'm Butters.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! 
"
6,5,Cartman,"Stan, okay. What's your name? 
"
5,9,Cartman,"Uh, whatever!
"
5,2,Randy,"What did you say?!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Shut your God-damned mouth!
"
1,5,Kyle,"Watch out Stan!  Genetic engineers are crazy. 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Weak. 
"
11,1,Randy,"Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"You little turds!! You've ruined my life for the last time!! 
"
4,8,Wendy,"What??
"
13,9,Butters,"Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.
"
18,5,Cartman,"I'm dying of boredom.
"
8,2,Cartman,"One thousand dollars, yeah!
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Yep, b-b-b-bail. 
"
9,3,Stan,"Hey yeah! We deserve that money just as much as he does.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Ssso it was all for nothing. The whole time I was... eating farts for nothing.
"
1,1,Stan,"Cartman, there's a 80-foot satellite dish sticking out of your ass!
"
16,6,Kyle,"IT WASN'T MY IDEA, IT WAS YOURS! YOU KILLED KENNY, YOU BASTARD!
"
17,10,Butters,"Well, m-no. I've got arms and legs; I've got everything.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Oh, my God! 
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Damn this beautiful face of mine! Damn it to hell!!  We have to get the surgery again, Mr. Hat. I want to be the old me again! 
"
13,11,Cartman,"Dude, you know what? Japanese people really do not like whales.  Uh oh.
"
15,2,Stan,"Oh man, really?
"
5,8,Stan,"Agh. Come on, they've gotta have our video game around here somewhere. 
"
7,3,Kyle,"Hold it!  Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mrs. Streible. We have something we need to tell you.
"
6,13,Kyle,"We have in our possession something of great power.  It is... The Lord of the Rings.
"
1,8,Kyle,"Yeah, I like him a lot more than Cartman.
"
6,16,Stan,"No, I actually have a way to be sure.  I'm going to cut off my hand. If he is my future self, then his hand will disappear.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Well, let's see. I'd like to start, if I may, back when I was two and a half. It was a cold April morning, and the dew on the grass was frozen, like tiny beads of glass...
"
5,10,Cartman,"So does that mean I'll never laugh again?
"
5,6,Cartman,"Alright folks, we've had another change in policy. I've had to hire a maintenance person, and to pay his salary I have to let in two more people a day.  However, the stupid maintenance worker demanded I have food and drinks inside the park, so now I've had to hire a beverage person, and a cotton-candy person, which means I now have to let eight people come in a day! BUT, you are to try your best not to ride any rides that I am on! Understood?  Alright, let's go. 
"
8,8,Cartman,"Aw, you're just saying that because I broke your cat's leg last week.
"
4,3,Cartman,"Huh?
"
6,8,Randy,"It couldn't hurt.
"
18,10,Cartman,"God damn it, who the hell do you think you are?! If you don't stop right now-!
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles!  Gobbles!  Up, heh. Uh!  Heeey, Gobbles!  Gobbles.  Gobbles! 
"
14,4,Stan,"Ah fuck.
"
3,1,Stan,"Aaah! Snake!
"
8,2,Kyle,"Oh no. Cartman, no!
"
13,1,Kyle,"Alright alright Kenny, calm down. You're too young to be getting BJs anyway. It's good you and Tammy are making a commitment to each other that isn't based on sex.
"
16,13,Butters,"Go Stan!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Not this time! They dropped their card. Now we know where CAA Talent Agency is! We're gonna march in there, and get our client back.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken.
"
1,1,Cartman,"Oh!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!
"
2,11,Cartman,"Shut your God-damned mouth
or else I'm... gonna... kick you
square in the balls... ass-hole
Aw, damn it! 
"
5,5,Stan,"But where's Phillip?
"
5,13,Kyle,"A trampoline?
"
12,10,Stan,"I'm outta here; see ya guys. 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Welcome back, dude.
"
3,2,Kyle,"How come you're not dead yet, Cartman?!
"
11,7,Cartman,"All right, here we go! Jimmy? 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Grrr. Jesus Christ I can't go on like this.  Butters, remember when you said you had a video of Eric Cartman dressed like Britney Spears?
"
7,6,Kyle,"But they said we can't charge the front door.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Jews can't be firemen.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"It's called a lock-in at the rec center. We can use all the rec center facilities. We can play basketball, go swimming, or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and ...p-puzzles.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Eric, I can't tell you why, but it's very important that I score to-night! Can you come on the date and help me? You're like a white... Hitch.
"
2,13,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
1,13,Kyle,"Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?
"
5,6,Stan,"What's that?
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Stop! There are some extremists! They are threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they are going to bomb us!
"
10,1,Kyle,"...Chef?? A-are you okay?
"
9,6,Cartman,"Just the good times.
"
7,13,Randy,"I don't have a son!
"
1,5,Kyle,"Is he bigger than a regular clone?
"
16,11,Butters,"Oh please, i-if it weren't for him I couldn't have come.
"
1,1,Kenny,"(Don't worry, I'm alright. Argh!) 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Now, I don't really have any pajamas—guess I'll just... sleep in my boxers or something.
"
4,9,Cartman,"No! He can't be dead!
"
2,15,Stan,"Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
"
6,13,Kyle,"I'm a Paladin, Cartman!
"
7,6,Kenny,"(Pakew! Pakew!)
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Eric, there's something I really need to know.
"
16,12,Randy,"No place like the video store, eh, my friend? Convenience at its peak.
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
"
16,12,Randy,"Nono, I need everybody tonight!  It's our big night!
"
4,16,Butters,"Oo-what the heck are you talkin' about?
"
18,5,Cartman,"Because, Butters-
"
13,13,Wendy,"And that is why... I'm stepping down. You were right all along, Cartman. And I am hereby making you the student body president.
"
13,12,Cartman,"No! That'll just make you bigger fags!
"
1,12,Cartman,"Be careful where you put that carrot. Kyle might steal it.
"
2,12,Stan,"Crap!
"
15,10,Mr. Garrison,"And now number 17 many of you got wrong as well. The correct answer was D, whales are mammals. 
"
11,14,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
4,12,Timmy,"Please help me. Please help me.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Yes I do!
"
13,8,Kyle,"So then why do you just ignore it using something as stupid as Chipotaway?
"
16,3,Cartman,"Alright, football night, what do you do?
Get out your camera and a boobie or two.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Fruttar sheshar.  What the hell is going on here? We've gotta sneak our back into the back Butters- uh huck!  There they are! Chinese people! There are Chinese people right over there!  Do you see them?
"
16,1,Cartman,"My potty? What are they going to do to it? 
"
7,9,Stan,"I thought albums win either gold or platinum.
"
3,6,Stan,"We want Sexual Harassment Panda.
"
4,16,Stan,"Parents can be pretty cruel sometimes, dude. They get off on it.
"
18,2,Cartman,"THERE'S NO SNACKS LEFT, KYLE! THEY TOOK ALL THE SNACKS AND THE PIZZA AND THE CAKE AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PARTY!
"
1,6,Kyle,"Yeah, stupid!
"
7,8,Cartman,"I'm like, a quarter-bi. My grandpa was bi, so that makes me quarter-bi.
"
1,1,Stan,"Cool.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Dude, we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Man, Vietnam was sweet!
"
6,1,Butters,"Well you guys have already got me in Dutch for gettin' fat, and then I got in double-Dutch for... havin' liposuction, and now you're askin' me to be in triple Dutch?!  Huh-uh! I'll never be that Dutch!
"
2,17,Stan,"Uh...
"
11,5,Kyle,"Happy Easter, Jesus. 
"
6,14,Cartman,"It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. 
"
13,4,Cartman,"Dumb?! Phillip farted in somebody's face super hard! But you don't know who until this week's episode!
"
16,3,Kyle,"Copy, Fox trot, let's fly in the goods Tango.
"
11,11,Kyle,"WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!
"
4,9,Cartman,"My... girrrrrrrl... 
"
10,14,Stan,"Why not?!
"
1,6,Cartman,"I don't know.
"
10,6,Stan,"There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. 
"
16,6,Cartman,"Fuck you Kyle!
"
3,6,Kyle,"It's... big.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin' weirdos, man!
"
1,5,Stan,"Wait, wait, the pig just gave birth.  It, it had a baby!
"
6,11,Randy,"Wait, that's it. A wall. We could build a huge city wall all around South Park so that we have complete control over who comes in.
"
2,8,Stan,"There, how does that look?
"
2,9,Wendy,"Eeewww!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Giya! Shut up, hippies! I'll kill you!  Iya!
"
11,6,Kyle,"Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. 
"
18,3,Randy,"Hi Carol.
"
3,5,Kyle,"Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby.
"
6,14,Cartman,"Yes sir!  Phew. 
"
3,12,Stan,"Oh, no! The pirate ghosts are back! 
"
15,11,Randy,"I mean, look guys, I know it's just the Dolphins, but Tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future. What do you think, Nelson?
"
15,2,Kyle,"Don't hurt anybody, sir. We could try and fix this.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Duhhh!
"
2,16,Cartman,"And another thing: it says that Mr. Hankey is also appearing at the Crossroads Mall!
"
10,14,Stan,"Jesus Christ. 
"
12,3,Cartman,"Oh oh no no, I cannot possibly take in another.
"
14,4,Wendy,"I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke?
"
16,5,Stan,"Butters, you're the star of the video!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Token, calm down.
"
1,13,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny.
"
1,10,Stan,"Nah, I saw it on Star Trek.
"
6,16,Randy,"How could he possibly know all that unless... he is our son from the future.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Nya nya nya nya nyaaa nya! We are comedy writers and you guys aren't! Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I've been thinking: We've got to patent the fishsticks joke.
"
13,3,Jimmy,"Kyle please! For fu-fu for for-fu-fuck's sake, don't do anything drastic.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Hey Kyle. What's up?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Huh?
"
15,10,Stan,"Whoa whoa wait, wait! 
"
12,14,Butters,"I'm so hungry, but just, just remembering how that blood tasted before ju- blood is all clammy and tomato-y. It makes me wanna... 
"
9,8,Cartman,"Hehe, I broke the dam. Hehe.
"
1,6,Cartman,"That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
"
3,2,Randy,"Whoa hoho, whoa!  Oh wow, oh, ah, I'm the best! Yeah! Yeah! Ah, it's just so amazing to be told that you're the best. I, I thought I was just a normal person like all of you, but... Yeah! Well, thank you for showing me otherwise! Yeah! I kick ass, yeah!
"
16,4,Kyle,"I looked on the known species webpage. There's no animal called a 'Jewpacabra' mentioned anywhere.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Sick, dude!
"
5,6,Stan,"Kyle, you gotta see!! 
"
5,2,Stan,"Dad, I was just tryin' tuh-
"
7,3,Stan,"Kyle's not gonna say anything, alright?
"
15,1,Cartman,"Toshiba Handibook??
"
1,5,Cartman,"That's why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig.  Cause its poop is small.
"
2,7,Stan,"Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.
"
5,10,Stan,"Wow, Cartman actually felt bad for somebody and couldn't laugh at them.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus! Uh, look, the haunted house ride broke down. I need you to fix it.
"
3,3,Kenny,"{Maybe he took a dump and got sick.} 
"
7,10,Stan,"Hey Dad, how come they let old people drive?
"
15,7,Kyle,"No.
"
18,9,Cartman,"God these guys are so annoying, aren't they? CartmaaanBrah!
"
13,8,Stan,"So he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl.
"
3,17,Kyle,"There is no brown noise, fat boy!
"
3,16,Kyle,"You got your period too, Kenny?
"
9,6,Butters,"AAAH!  Oh Jesus.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Oooaaagh.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Argh!
"
16,5,Stan,"Well then write the principal an anonymous letter.
"
2,8,Stan,"That's good. 
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"I can't go tomorrow, the Jizzfest is tonight!
"
2,12,Stan,"What's 'skylarkings'?
"
18,1,Kyle,"Yeah, that's why we wanna have a startup company.
"
1,5,Stan,"Mom and dad are home.  My house is a disaster, you guy- you guys have got to help me.
"
6,9,Kyle,"Yeah. We'll be the ""Save Films From Their Own Directors"" club
"
13,6,Randy,"No. I've got it all figured out, son. You have to kill the alien.
"
5,5,Kenny,"(OOOWWW!)
"
1,13,Kyle,"Man. Cartman's more screwed up than I thought.
"
6,10,Kyle,"Hoh hoh hoh!
"
14,1,Kyle,"Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?
"
4,17,Stan,"Okay, here's the script. But it doesn't have an ending.
"
17,7,Randy,"Winter is coming, Sharon, and I'm a sneaky little bee.  Bzzz bzzz. 
"
1,4,Kyle,"Oof. 
"
8,10,Cartman,"Whatever, that's like five years from now.
"
7,14,Butters,"Wuh it's me, Butters.
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, hurry up in there!  Jesus.  You're taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight!  You in there?!  Hey, where the hell did she go?  What the?  Haaa! Who? Who are you?
"
4,3,Stan,"Two hours.
"
12,1,Cartman,"I'm not just sure, Butters. I'm HIV-positive.
"
7,11,Stan,"Dude that's not funny. You shouldn't joke about that.
"
1,10,Kenny,"Quack-quack.
"
6,4,Cartman,"""Captain, this whole thing is ridiculous!""
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - uh, view - of Kathie Lee.
"
2,15,Stan,"Yeah!
"
13,8,Kyle,"What?! Are you serious?!
"
5,12,Cartman,"Oh, god dammit!
"
5,7,Kyle,"Well why not? You want us to get AIDS?
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Say fellas, Jimmy and I were wondering if maybe you would come and cheer for us next S-S-Saturday. We're both competing in the Special Olympics down in Denver.
"
9,5,Stan,"We did it! We did it!
"
12,5,Cartman,"Mr. Cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
"
3,13,Kyle,"Huh?
"
12,10,Stan,"Yeah, why not? We get some instruments and some costumes and then... make some crappy pan flute music CDs on my computer.
"
4,4,Wendy,"1776.
"
6,12,Stan,"Cartman, come on!
"
4,12,Timmy,"Tuh-timmih?
"
11,9,Randy,"Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?
"
18,5,Randy,"Oh yeah, this is gonna work great. 
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Stop them! They're crab people!
"
10,8,Randy,"Staaan! 
"
2,10,Stan,"Of course!
"
17,9,Stan,"And you swear you'll be okay with that? You won't talk about the XBox being better ever again?
"
1,5,Kyle,"Hey look!  It's working.
"
14,10,Stan,"Look, dude!  Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time.
"
4,2,Kyle,"I mean, what if I'm just part of my parents' reality?
"
7,8,Kyle,"What?
"
5,9,Kyle,"I'm confused.
"
11,11,Kyle,"Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Alright, now, Stan. For you I've put together a really nice design. I feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that. So what I wanna to is put a note on your parents' door, telling them I'm the counselor from the school.
"
2,12,Butters,"Pass this up.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Well, what do you mean?
"
3,2,Cartman,"Hey, wait! Where the hell are you going?! 
"
6,10,Kyle,"Dude! Bebe is really smart!
"
8,9,Stan,"Dad, how come Wall-Mart is able to sell everything so cheap?
"
13,10,Stan,"Dude.
"
7,1,Kyle,"No! 
"
15,13,Cartman,"Does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you? 
"
16,7,Cartman,"That's right, Cupid Me. People who are the same belong together.
"
10,12,Cartman,"Jesus Christ!
"
13,1,Cartman,"Would you look at that? It's just incredible, isn't it?
"
15,8,Kyle,"Oh shut up Cartman! You don't even know what you're talking about!
"
3,4,Stan,"No he's not dude. Craig is a wuss.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Kyle, are you on your computer?
"
2,7,Kyle,"Wait a minute. I though your father was your mother 'cause she had a penis.
"
3,5,Kyle,"What?
"
3,3,Stan,"Oh-hoho!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Yeah uh huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but I'm really a girl.
"
18,7,Butters,"I'm gonna beat her up and take her money!
"
1,10,Stan,"What?
"
3,4,Wendy,"I requested to be in shop class, but they sent me here.
"
3,1,Kyle,"My guess would be 'yes.'
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Dude, what the fuck are you doing?!)
"
1,1,Kyle,"What am I going to do? My little brother's been abducted by aliens.  You farted. 
"
4,1,Cartman,"Do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last Christmas?!
"
16,12,Stan,"Yeah, it's awesome! Thanks, Mom.
"
8,11,Butters,"Does... Does this mean we're still gonna get cancelled?
"
8,14,Kyle,"Oh God, what have I done?!  I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist.
"
13,10,Stan,"Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that.
"
8,1,Stan,"Dude, we're like the coolest kids in the whole state! 
"
12,11,Randy,"What is it?
"
15,4,Cartman,"I'm not fat! I'm big-boned!
"
14,3,Randy,"Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion  and give me some of that purplish stuff too!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Okay, that's does it! Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?! 
"
3,4,Cartman,"You know, you guys are totally wrong about Tweek. Craig is way worse than he is. 
"
9,4,Cartman,"Yes!
"
9,14,Randy,"They say her divine ass blood has miraculous healing power. She can cure my alcoholism! I'll be back soon!
"
18,1,Kyle,"When Kickstarter went down, many saw their startup projects die, but here at Washington Redskins, we saw opportunity. People still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects, and with the Redskins you can now go fund yourself.  And the idea is simple. You, the people, go out and raise all your own money, and give the Washington Redskins 5%.
"
14,6,Kyle,"Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!
"
4,2,Stan,"Come on, Kyle! 
"
6,9,Cartman,"Yeah, hippies and terrorists are the same thing.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Aw God, that movie pissed me off.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Right, but she's not, in real life. She's a hobbit.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Oh-HO, grohoss.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Did you notice the bow?  I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way. I have to take a shit.  Aaahhh!
"
17,2,Cartman,"You know, if I'd been caught lying about something, that's exactly what I would have said.
"
6,10,Butters,"Then we gotta work on your campaign.
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?!
"
11,12,Cartman,"...What?
"
7,1,Cartman,"Yeah! We'd never do that on Earth! 
"
2,14,Kyle,"We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
"
12,13,Cartman,"Fuck you, Kyle! 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Oh uh, you know, all over cancer.
"
6,16,Stan,"Yeah, it's like everything I do, he...  Wait a minute, what'd you say?
"
3,2,Cartman,"Hey you guys. Seriously. 
"
3,3,Stan,"God-damnit! You can't fall asleep.
"
2,9,Stan,"Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you.
"
12,6,Randy,"Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhh! 
"
8,9,Stan,"Come on, let's go to Main Street and support one of those stores. 
"
6,1,Butters,"Look, fellas, I can't do it! My mom and dad call in every hour from work to make sure I am here. If I don't answer the ph-phone, it'll know I'm- I'm up to no good!
"
4,12,Stan,"Dude, we gotta find some third-graders to beat up.  Hey, come here 
"
12,2,Butters,"Well this costume was supposed to be for the Easter musical, fellas, not for tryin' to make an easy buck! 
"
12,8,Cartman,"Dude...
"
16,3,Kenny,"(Hey, just accept Faith Hilling is out of style!)
"
9,10,Wendy,"Oh great. It's a pretty easy project. Kyle's really good with the egg. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Yeah. I think we get along okay.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Aw, Goddammit!
"
18,5,Butters,"I don't know, this bird nest is pretty neato.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Hello, ma'am. I'm working to clean up the neighborhood from parasites. Do you mind if I take a quick look around your house? I'm afraid you may have hippies.
"
12,14,Butters,"Oh Jeez...
"
9,12,Cartman,"Okay, be a Jew. We're gonna go play laser tag. 
"
6,12,Cartman,"How?
"
13,12,Kenny,"(Meee toooo.) 
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, Wendy plays volleyball. Did you know that? I don't think you knew that.
"
16,10,Randy,"Look, look, the thing is, do we tell Gerald, or do we just stay out of it?
"
10,3,Mr. Mackey,"Retaliation... Oh my God. M'kay?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Really?
"
3,13,Kyle,"Rebecca. You...
"
14,14,Kyle,"He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
"
9,6,Butters,"Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Well, I saved you all the chicken part. 
"
15,5,Kyle,"It's unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don't think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might've got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go.  No way!  This is it!
"
13,9,Butters,"Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today.
"
4,14,Kyle,"Revamp how? The rules are that the fourth grade class has to perform the Helen Keller Story.
"
2,2,Stan,"I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Stan, I have to go home!! I need my cream!! I need my creeheam!!
"
10,14,Stan,"Hey. Hey, you can't do this.  We've, we've been through all this stupid emotional crap!
"
14,4,Stan,"Oh...
"
3,12,Kyle,"I don't think my mom would want me doin' this.
"
1,9,Cartman,"O-ho. Weeeeeeeeeellll
Kyle's mom is a bitch, 
she's a big fat bitch, 
she's the biggest bitch in the whole wide world
She a stupid bitch, 
if there ever was a bitch, 
she's a bitch to all the boys and girls.
"
8,5,Butters,"Yep! Don't you know nothin' about robot? Come on, AWESOM-O! You can put my laundry away! 
"
5,3,Stan,"Wow, the Moses.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg.
"
1,11,Wendy,"When someone gets as old as you,  do they have to wear Depends undergarments? 
"
6,3,Butters,"Aw jeez, ah I didn't mean to almost kill Grandma. I promise I'll never go on TV with balls on my chin again.
"
7,1,Cartman,"SHUT UP, KYLE! SHUT YOUR GOD-DAMNED MOUTH! 
"
10,2,Randy,"Yeah. Good going, stupid!
"
9,6,Butters,"I'll miss you too, ghost pal.
"
1,6,Stan,"Can I eat my cake in the living room mom? Please, can I?
"
7,2,Mr. Garrison,"What an inspiration.
"
11,11,Kyle,"Stan?
"
6,1,Cartman,"Aw, man, if I was older, I would totally start jacking off right now.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Nice form, compadre. 
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, a student is trying to make an appointment to see the principal. M'kay?
"
3,8,Butters,"Wha-ah I don't know about this, uh. I think I'll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin' is the thing to do right now.  Waaah!  Gooh. 
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"No! No, Filmore! You can say ""I have to poop and shit,"" or ""Oh, shit, I have to poop,"" but not ""I have to shit."" Are we all clear?
"
18,3,Randy,"Yah, that's my cover.
"
3,8,Randy,"I love havin' a family and all. I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things.
"
16,6,Cartman,"Kenny, whose idea was it to go ziplining? Mine, or Kyle's?
"
1,1,Stan,"What the hell was that?
"
2,7,Cartman,"Really? Uh, I don't think I have to fart anymore tonight.
"
1,3,Stan,"But I just wanted you to be proud of me, like you were with Kenny.
"
9,6,Butters,"Yes! Uh yes sir! I believe you.
"
15,8,Stan,"Dude, I'm sorry. I've been a shitty friend. I miss my buddy. You were right: Adam Sandler is fuckin' hysterical!
"
14,7,Timmy,"Timmeh!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"What kind of shortcuts?
"
2,5,Cartman,"AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!
"
6,4,Cartman,"And Worf?
"
5,6,Stan,"Oh my God.
"
3,10,Stan,"Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah. Do you have any ""nurections""?
"
9,12,Stan,"Yeah?
"
12,9,Butters,"Huh.
"
7,11,Butters,"Waaaaaah!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Tweek, now Goddamnit, we picked you to be our new friend to replace Kenny because we thought you were a team player!
"
18,9,Kyle,"You're not gonna believe this.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Butters!
"
10,7,Cartman,"Yeah. I guess so.
"
18,7,Stan,"So now we are in th real world.
"
1,6,Mr. Garrison,"Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters.
"
13,12,Stan,"Today, we've made history.
"
3,8,Randy,"...Well it is a night for experimenting.
"
7,11,Stan,"What's Casa Bonita?
"
12,13,Kyle,"Some kids think I'm strange 'cause I like studying for an exam
But I don't let that bother me, because it's who I am. 
"
7,9,Cartman,"Okay, fine! Ready?! First one to have a platinum album wins! Go! 
"
1,9,Cartman,"Oh, boy!  Superbitch is at it again!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Don't worry, fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise: there's not gonna be any comedy awards next year!
"
5,2,Stan,"And best of all, we met this kid named Jimmy. He's disabled, but he doesn't let it ruin his life! He's awesome!
"
15,6,Butters,"What?
"
17,6,Stan,"What the fuck?
"
15,13,Kyle,"Would you please just open your wormhole?!
"
9,4,Kyle,"Kenny! You're alive!
"
6,16,Butters,"Oh! Are we out for an adventure? 
"
5,3,Cartman,"Bliegh!  Yugh. Uh, okay, try again. Hep .
"
9,4,Cartman,"Oh, Goddammit!  They'd better not sell out!
"
12,7,Wendy,"Thanks, Stan.
"
6,5,Butters,"Awww, they didn't play it. They didn't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer.
"
3,8,Stan,"Dad! Dad, they shot at us.
"
11,14,Kyle,"That should just about do it.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy. 
"
15,9,Cartman,"No Mexicans detected.  Huh, nothing.
"
14,2,Butters,"Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly.
"
14,4,Randy,"Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?
"
2,8,Cartman,"Huh?  Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..! 
"
11,1,Randy,"No.
"
16,6,Cartman,"Oh God!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Sir, you recently passed a new law allowing parents who have given their children up for adoption to change their minds. My little brother was-
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
8,11,Stan,"Gee, what a concidence.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Dude. NOW this is getting weird!
"
4,8,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, Tuesday morning's good.
"
6,15,Stan,"Dude, you don't believe that guy talked to your grandma, do you? 
"
3,11,Cartman,"T'heh, whatever. 
"
17,7,Cartman,"They don't salute in Game of Thrones, Butters.
"
8,1,Butters,"Wowee! Hey, can I play, ninjas with you?
"
15,6,Butters,"Pardon me?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"A what? Oh, you mean the fellas. Well sure. But I can't talk about the club on account of its sssuper secret, dawg.
"
13,7,Butters,"One box of Italian passports. One necklace, gold. Three crewmember watches.
"
8,4,Kyle,"...What the hell just happened?
"
2,18,Kyle,"Me, too. He sucks.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Mister!  No! Stop, Token, stop! My brains! Stop eating my brains! Brad Pitt!  Hey Token. What's up, bro?  Fist bump? 
"
1,2,Wendy,"I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.
"
9,9,Stan,"Oh my God, how does it know the answer?
"
12,2,Kyle,"Excuse us, we're trying to get a picture of Britney Spears!
"
14,8,Butters,"There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Are you guys having a meeting or something?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Come on. We have to take the bus to Five Points in Denver.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Hahnah Timmih.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Bohogh, egh. 
"
3,15,Kyle,"I made you out of clay.
"
2,13,Kyle,"That wasn't quite ten seconds.
"
7,15,Stan,"And... I'm not gonna have a Christmas adventure. 
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"That can't be.
"
10,1,Cartman,"I'm gonna miss him.  I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! 
"
1,8,Stan,"You mean, like Kenny?
"
11,4,Kyle,"Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Aaaah! Runrunruuun! 
"
14,1,Kyle,"What?!
"
15,12,Butters,"Uh but, then, why does his face look like that? 
"
10,4,Cartman,"I can't let you do that!
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
"
11,3,Cartman,"I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!
"
6,13,Kyle,"Dude, that video is making people act strange.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
2,9,Stan,"Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!  Blaach! 
"
8,4,Stan,"So you'll do it?
"
1,7,Kyle,"We can eat it at Cartman's house, and see more naughty pictures of his mom.
"
14,6,Kyle,"Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!
"
1,4,Stan,"I missed you old pal, you really had me scared.
"
1,9,Cartman,"Gross, Kyle!
"
2,6,Stan,"Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin'. 
"
2,12,Kyle,"Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?
"
1,4,Stan,"Sick, shut up dude. 
"
6,4,Butters,"I sure did. We'll have those poor baby cows in shape in no time!
"
9,12,Cartman,"Stan, I just want you to know that I still hate Kyle more than you. 
"
5,10,Cartman,"I just have to find my funny bone again! Just try and make me laugh.
"
3,1,Cartman,"I wasn't saying anything about their culture, I was just saying their city smells like ass.
"
3,2,Stan,"Then a crown of thorns was placed on Jesus's head, and Jesus was all like, ""Thanks.""
"
4,12,Stan,"It can't be that bad. People do it on TV all the time.
"
18,5,Cartman,"You're welcome. 
"
7,13,Kyle,"You guys, maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasn't the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke.
"
9,2,Randy,"What are you talking about?
"
11,2,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, Eric Cartman? We got an emergency message from your mother?  ""Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have it after all. Found it under your desk."" She said you'd know what that means, m'kay? 
"
1,10,Cartman,"Psych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder?  Byah. Oof! 
"
17,2,Jimmy,"There he is. Hey Kyle!  The parental lock isn't working. Our parents are still watching murder porn.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"You... yuh, you what?
"
12,8,Butters,"By, by my, by myself?
"
12,9,Cartman,"Stan, Stan! Dude, we need to talk.
"
2,2,Cartman,"What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?
"
9,5,Stan,"Aw Jesus, not again.
"
10,10,Cartman,"It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor.  This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.
"
1,2,Kyle,"You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!
"
13,11,Stan,"Those guys are always covered in dolphin and whale guts. They don't care if they stink. Come on, let's break their boat.
"
6,11,Randy,"Stan, our abduction problems are over. We got the new Child Tracker.
"
6,4,Stan,"Yeah, I wouldn't have.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Well? Now what are we going to do?
"
2,13,Stan,"What the hell was that?
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Is this still part of the show?
"
9,8,Mr. Mackey,"Quiet, children, quiet! We need to hear.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Hey, you scrawny-eyed shithead, what the fuck is wrong with you?! You must be some kind of fucking asshole to be able to ignore a crying child!
"
6,7,Cartman,"I see, very interesting. 
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Kyle Broflovski to the principal's office. Please. Umkay?
"
10,11,Butters,"Then do it, if you're not yellow! 
"
6,15,Stan,"There's nothing special about you, dude. Get over yourself.
"
1,2,Kyle,"What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?
"
4,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel.
"
10,11,Cartman,"How do you know??
"
1,12,Cartman,"What's that noise? 
"
15,2,Kyle,"Dude, an awards show just for comedy sounds like a bad idea.
"
1,11,Kyle,"Cartman, are you still trying to become a lesbian?!
"
16,6,Kyle,"I don't know, I-I just thought if we all drank the Mountain Dew, the caffeine and the sugar would help us stay awake. I told Cartman he has to share it.
"
2,11,Stan,"No.
"
17,3,Cartman,"You interrupt people when they talk.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Hey dudes.  What are those?
"
8,9,Randy,"Oh Jesus, a broken glass! Well, I don't see any choice now! We have to go to Wall-Mart!
"
9,5,Stan,"Come on, Dad! Get up!
"
6,6,Butters,"Join me?
"
12,9,Wendy,"That's right, I'm gonna kick your ass!
"
16,10,Kyle,"What?!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Goddamnit, what the fuck is going on?
"
14,1,Cartman,"Oh, you're going down, Elin!
"
5,4,Cartman,"I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
"
6,11,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay.
"
5,8,Stan,"Towelie!
"
16,14,Kyle,"Butters, you know something, don't you?!
"
3,2,Stan,"Uh, it... sucks ass.
"
6,10,Cartman,"That's fine! That's fine!! Fuck you, Kyle, and fuck you, Stan!  Fuck you, Tweek!  Bebe, you're still cool. 
"
14,4,Cartman,"Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy
"
5,12,Cartman,"Aw, that is such bullcrap!
"
17,6,Cartman,"No, Kyle, you were right. I see now that little lies can cause huge problems.
"
17,6,Kenny,"(That's okay, Kyle.)
"
1,1,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, do you need to sit in the corner until your flaming gas is under control?
"
14,3,Kyle,"Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(And not getting a blowjob...)
"
4,15,Kyle,"For what?
"
2,3,Cartman,"Poor people tend to live in clusters.
"
8,11,Butters,"Stupid news hair! 
"
18,6,Kyle,"You're saging these games do this on purpose?!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Rats.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm--  Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-damnit!  Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million dollars, don't you? That's it! 
"
17,1,Butters,"Yeah. Whattaya think President Obama means when he says that?
"
12,6,Randy,"Marsh.
"
6,7,Stan,"We're dead!
"
6,16,Stan,"Where is he now?
"
9,13,Stan,"Okay, where to next?
"
10,7,Cartman,"What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!
"
8,4,Stan,"All right Butters!
"
12,13,Stan,"Really?
"
4,8,Wendy,"Weird, um. Okay. Uh. Now, let's say that first we talk about the history of the flag.  We can show that the- 
"
1,7,Cartman,"Damn it! We'll never get any candy if Kenny keeps eating people!
"
3,6,Stan,"Yeah, Sexual Harassment Panda. He's the one that started all this. We have to find him!
"
2,15,Stan,"You're not gonna get away with this! 
"
18,9,Kyle,"Dude! Nobody wants to hear you commenting on things!
"
5,2,Randy,"Come on, Stan.
"
16,2,Kyle,"Dude, that's terrible!
"
13,3,Kyle,"I just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this.
"
13,9,Butters,"So what?!  So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
"
11,11,Cartman,"In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- 
"
3,12,Cartman,"Wow, cool!
"
17,3,Cartman,"It's okay. We have reason to believe it hasn't spread yet.
"
6,5,Kyle,"Get it back to normal, Chef!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hello? ...BHI records? ...Oh, it's for you, Ms. Lopez. 
"
2,4,Kyle,"I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"But--
"
8,4,Stan,"Hey, he- Is that the only song he'll dance to?
"
4,12,Cartman,"Yeah. Only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Jesus loves me this I know
'Cause Republicans tell me so
Little ones God will protect
'Cause letting kids be harmed is child neglect
Everything still clear out there?
"
2,9,Stan,"Sorry.
"
15,12,Kyle,"Four weeks we gotta do this?
"
10,7,Cartman,"Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?!  Jesus. What's happening to me?
"
9,9,Cartman,"Just do what you were sent to do, dickface! 
"
9,9,Butters,"Stand back! I had a... great time tonight, but I gotta do what I was sent here to do! 
"
3,3,Stan,"Chef, we have to talk to you!
"
17,5,Kyle,"I'm your big brother, Ike! 
"
6,4,Cartman,"What? What the hell are you guys doing??
"
18,9,Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. Before we get started, Kyle has asked to say a few words. Go ahead, Kyle.
"
7,3,Cartman,"I'm afraid I can't let that happen.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon.
"
1,7,Kyle,"What?! But she looks just like everybody else. Up yours, Tina Yothers! 
"
1,3,Mr. Garrison,"South Park is saved. 
"
15,1,Kyle,"(Oh, shit!)
"
16,6,Stan,"And finally, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I said ""Stop it!""
"
11,12,Kyle,"Stan! Dude, is that you?
"
18,6,Stan,"Yeah, I just wasn't feelin' the best.
"
7,4,Randy,"Come on up here, everybody! 
"
3,8,Randy,"Who who did you hear is, is gay?!
"
5,13,Cartman,"Just remember what I taught you and follow protocol. Next number to try is on the list.
"
4,12,Timmy,"Ah, please help!
"
7,10,Stan,"Hey Dad.
"
3,5,Stan,"Not here! Go further away!
"
2,15,Stan,"I haven't been sleeping well.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"It IS incredible, Mr. Hat. And what makes IT possible  is IT's patented gyroscope design.  Gentlemen, I give you, IT!
"
15,10,Stan,"Come on, guys! 
"
2,10,Kyle,"Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, that's okay. I've got a special kids' room down in the basement.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Oh my God! Selena Gomez! You  you actually got her to come! 
"
16,14,Cartman,"No way dude. No way.
"
16,12,Randy,"Streaming Halloween 4! Hahaha!
"
18,2,Cartman,"You know what we gotta do, guys?  We've gotta throw a big fuckin' party
"
2,17,Kyle,"I think it went really good. Those people really got into it.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Okay, that's fine.
"
3,3,Kyle,"We need you, Chef.
"
5,8,Stan,"What?
"
16,13,Cartman,"The big whoop isn't that you have one, the big whoop is that you're still wearing it!
"
3,14,Cartman,"No! What about the Confederasuh?! What about freedom?!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Don't be too hard on yourself, Butters. You can't help being a douchebag. Wait, Butters, look!  This is it! This is our chance! Swing over, Butters! Go!
"
7,9,Kyle,"From now on, MOOP isn't about money. MOOP is about music! We're not striking anymore! Who's with us?! 
"
3,5,Cartman,"What are we doing out here, you guys? I wanna see if Jakov wins that game show.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Aw, they wanna fight! They just don't know it yet! 
"
1,11,Kyle,"Down by the fire?
"
8,8,Kyle,"A giant douche.
"
7,10,Cartman,"They're not gonna stop until we're all dead!
"
15,7,Stan,"I just turned 10.
"
12,9,Wendy,"I'll smack the shit out of you!
"
12,9,Wendy,"You'd better shut up  or I'll make you shut up!
"
6,8,Kyle,"Well, Cartman?
"
5,1,Stan,"You know what it is?
"
5,3,Kyle,"Mass suicide?
"
18,3,Randy,"It started off so simple. There's a guy at work. Hanson. He would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up, you know? Not only that, but he was in there all the time! I finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman. I called myself Lorde. Have you ever been in a woman's bathroom, Stan? It's all clean and there's enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing. I started singing while I was in there, and then I- started writing things down.
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Oh I'm not the only one. There's lost of people doin' it.  Hey Butters. Stand ground.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Dude, this is awesome. I should've used the girls bathroom a long time ago.
"
10,10,Cartman,"Auth- authoritah?
"
17,8,Stan,"What I started? How dare you!
"
7,15,Cartman,"What?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone?  Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!
"
13,14,Butters,"Whoopie! 
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"Then you get an F, fail the third grade, and have to get a job cleaning septic tanks to support your drug habit.
"
2,7,Stan,"Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
"
1,10,Kyle,"You can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! 
"
4,2,Cartman,"Oh, what the hell is that little Pollack gonna do, huh? Come on, you guys. I say we create our own mob crime family!
"
2,2,Stan,"Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?
"
7,6,Cartman,"My God...
"
4,10,Stan,"Oh, there's Sister Anne! Come on, we've got to ask her about Timmy.  Sister Anne?
"
17,5,Kyle,"That's what I thought.
"
6,9,Cartman,"I told you guys: never underestimate the power of a free hat.
"
4,3,Cartman,"Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on! 
"
9,4,Kyle,"Cartman is NOT Kenny's BFF!
"
18,10,Stan,"Nnnothing, nothing.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Well, it sucks balls. Whattaya think?
"
6,6,Jimmy,"There's some chocolates and lih-licorice, and some games and peh- pencils inside.
"
4,2,Butters,"Well, uh, see ya, fellas. 
"
10,2,Kyle,"...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.
"
1,12,Stan,"Robert Smith, hit her nose. Use Robot Punch.
"
4,13,Cartman,"It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if--  There he is!
"
11,10,Kyle,"I...
"
17,1,Butters,"Oh my goodness! Your little cartoon has a girl on fire!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Guys! Guys! I've been workin' on it, and I think I have some answers.
"
7,11,Butters,"Hey, that's not very nice! This is my first society! I'm doin' my best!
"
1,7,Stan,"No, no, you're the ass master, there's a difference.
"
4,3,Randy,"You're from Cirque du Cheville. 
"
13,8,Kyle,"Ya see Ike? There's nothing. There's nothing for you to be afraid of.
"
16,10,Cartman,"God damn it I've had it with you people! When I signed up, I thought I was getting CSI guys protecting my ass, but all of you answering the phones are complete retards! Hello? 
"
2,3,Cartman,"Ey! 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Don't have a dad, Mike. That's not gonna work.
"
2,10,Stan,"Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. 
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles!  Hu-ugh, Gobbles! 
"
5,13,Kenny,"(Yes.)
"
7,9,Cartman,"It's just a matter of time, my friends. This weekend is Christfest. The single largest gathering of Christians in the Midwest. Each one of them a walking, praying wallet full of cash. And I'll be there selling my album.
"
3,2,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
9,7,Kyle,"Huh wuh, what's the matter?
"
1,5,Cartman,"Hey!  Why don't you go back to San Francisco with the rest of the Jews?!
"
17,8,Cartman,"Here's two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.
"
9,6,Cartman,"I don't know, but you're the only one who can.
"
13,10,Cartman,"You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!
"
12,8,Butters,"Uh, not exactly.
"
8,1,Kenny,"(Yeah, that'd be awesome!)
"
3,14,Stan,"Where the hell is Cartman? If he misses the orientation, they're not gonna let him in the reenactment. 
"
12,13,Stan,"What's High School Musical 1 and 2?
"
1,12,Cartman,"Come on, let me kick you in the nuts for it! 
"
6,9,Stan,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to do this ourselves.
"
1,7,Cartman,"Could I see that again? That was cool.
"
12,11,Mr. Garrison,"In the sewers? Can't be safe down there.
"
18,7,Kyle,"He said they're doing a Total Recall.
"
17,3,Cartman,"His name is Token.
"
5,12,Stan,"What's that?
"
3,2,Stan,"That's not your mom calling!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Well, why do I have to dress up like an old lady?
"
12,14,Stan,"Dude, what?
"
2,3,Randy,"Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.
"
3,8,Stan,"What do I have to do?
"
9,3,Stan,"Uh sure, here she is.  Okay, finarry everything rookin' up for me and my family.  Welcome to Shitty Wok, take your order prease?  Aw crap, Chinese Mafia!  Aaaaahh! 
"
2,7,Cartman,"I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Puh-I know, dude. Pete Melman crapped his pants. So freakin' funny! 
"
5,10,Cartman,"You guys, something's wrong.
"
2,10,Cartman,"I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.
"
2,14,Stan,"Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?
"
9,2,Randy,"Oh, Jesus, what has gotten into that kid?!
"
3,13,Cartman,"Uuh. Definition?
"
4,4,Cartman,"Oh, please, God, don't let him call on me. Father in heaven, I beg of you-
"
18,5,Stan,"Yeah, but seriously, it's like there's no real thing to hang on to, you know?
"
2,16,Cartman,"Uncle Stinky, can you drive us to the mall?
"
3,17,Kenny,"(Nuh-uh.)
"
11,2,Kyle,"I don't have it!
"
8,10,Butters,"Uh, Trent, now, listen to me. I'm sorry for the color-
"
5,11,Kyle,"Hold on. I see.  Oh, Jeezus, this sled is going faaaast.
"
4,6,Butters,"Well, uh I sure am, I guess.
"
1,6,Stan,"Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you.
"
5,1,Cartman,"Kyle, do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to The Lion King with you?! I mean, shit, dude, let it go.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Yeah, but Timmy can be really self-centered.
"
9,2,Stan,"All right.  'Scuse me.  Hello, we are selling magazine subscriptions for our community youth program. Would you like to help young people like us by purchasing a subscription of your choice?
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Con Te Partirт?) (...Su navi per mariche, io lo so,no, no, non esistono piщ.con te io li rivivrт. 'Con te...)
"
7,1,Kyle,"Oh my God, this is great!
"
8,3,Cartman,"But, I think it's best we don't talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps. 
"
3,1,Mr. Garrison,"Eric Cartman, you say ""excuse me""!
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Well, I like you-)
"
6,16,Cartman,"Poop comes in a lot of varieties, Butters. I wanna find the perfect one, tailored to your revenge on your parents.
"
2,13,Stan,"Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
"
3,16,Stan,"Dude, Cartman can't hit puberty before us.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Hegh. Oh! Here comes Space Mountain-oh-uugh.  Ogh! Wait-
"
16,8,Kyle,"But our big game with Lakewood is Saturday!
"
15,3,Kyle,"Where are you going?  Ike, where are you going?
"
13,9,Jimmy,"You're a man now! All right Butters good job!
"
1,12,Kyle,"You threw it away, Cartman! It's mine now.
"
3,3,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
"
3,10,Cartman,"God damnit, you're supposed to trade those, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!
"
4,2,Timmy,"Ha-a-ugh.
"
1,11,Stan,"You have to make love down by the fire, that's what Chef always says.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Where?
"
2,14,Stan,"We can't let him down, you guys.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes.
"
10,13,Cartman,"Me who?!
"
16,12,Stan,"Dad, nobody's gonna come.
"
4,15,Kenny,"(Ungh.) 
"
13,7,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! We can finally do it! We can finally leave this crappy town and live the life we've all dreamed of!
"
10,1,Stan,"Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. 
"
9,11,Cartman,"Better red than dead!
"
9,6,Cartman,"How stupid are you?! So help me GOD Butters, I'm gonna get you back for this! I'm going to  GET YOU BACK! 
"
2,16,Cartman,"Are you telling me that I drove nine hours through butt-fucking nowhere to get a god-damned shirt?! Mom, Grandma's gone senile! It's time to stick her in a home!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Dude, don't call my brother a dildo!
"
13,10,Stan,"Yeah?
"
12,8,Stan,"No, stop! Raape!
"
11,7,Stan,"No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!
"
4,4,Cartman,"Huh? Oh no! Agh!  Get off me! Get off me! Somebody help!! Please?? Somebody get it off of me!! Get it off of me.
"
14,1,Kyle,"Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool.
"
10,6,Stan,"Kenny! Here, take my hand!  Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!
"
12,2,Cartman,"We're professionals too, you fuckin' butthole! 
"
18,9,Kyle,"You know, you used to sit in the living room with your friends and family, and THEY were the ones commenting on whatever was on TV.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Well jumpin' Jesus, what are we wasting our time here for then? The talent show is happening right now! Let's get to r-r-rammin'! 
"
8,6,Kenny,"All right, but you guys owe me for this.
"
9,2,Cartman,"We drill.  I've designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd. They pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside.
"
1,8,Mr. Garrison,"Boys, you're too young to take care of a child! I'm afraid I'm going to have to call the Red Cross and have him returned.
"
7,14,Jimmy,"She's what?
"
4,1,Kyle,"If only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him.
"
10,12,Butters,"Quick, General Disarray! Kill those superheroes!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Shut up, fatass!
"
2,16,Stan,"Wake up, Cartman, we've got to get to the mall.
"
3,1,Cartman,"I was with my class, and we got all lost in the rainforest, and I need some food. I'm fading fast!
"
6,10,Kyle,"Hoh!  Anyways, you put a spin on it by holding it here and-
"
10,14,Stan,"No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!
"
12,9,Cartman,"She said it again. 
"
2,15,Stan,"AAAAAAAAH! 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Sure do.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Stop doing what?
"
13,6,Randy,"Stan, how do you think the Hollises beat us every year?  I'm sure they put lead in the wood or something; we're just leveling the playing field.  There.
"
15,6,Butters,"Huh?
"
4,9,Stan,"Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
"
12,4,Kyle,"We totally think you should have more money.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Please, Mr. Mackey, we'll be good. Don't send us to that ole kids' choir. Have mercy, Mr. Mackey.
"
2,6,Kyle,"We've got to get him back, dude.
"
14,14,Randy,"Channel blocked?  What the? The hell?  Sharon, what are you doing?
"
9,6,Butters,"Go away! You aren't real!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Jesus Christ! 
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Our students did average, maybe just below average.
"
15,7,Randy,"Get out of my room! I'm listening to my music! Gau!
"
5,6,Stan,"Come on, dude!
"
10,7,Cartman,"This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!
"
1,3,Cartman,"You guys, you guys, I was just kidding!
"
6,16,Stan,"That's weird, because I really didn't cut off my hand. It was fake.
"
12,13,Stan,"It is?
"
5,7,Stan,"...A what?
"
2,15,Cartman,"Aaah! Son of a bitch!
"
12,1,Butters,"Oh yeah, uh-well I guess that's true.
"
4,3,Kyle,"Hoh no, dude. If they get sent back to Romania, we'll never get our Cirque dei Ceville going.
"
1,7,Stan,"Oh yeah? Well, at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
"
10,8,Randy,"No time! Just take it! Here!  ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?
"
16,5,Stan,"Oh yeah.
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
4,2,Stan,"We all want double-desserts today!
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle?  Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
1,2,Cartman,"Dolphins, eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!
"
10,10,Stan,"Dude, what's the matter?
"
2,10,Stan,"I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
"
4,17,Cartman,"Heh-tchoo!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Ah.  Uh.  Yeeeesss!
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?
"
7,1,Cartman,"No, because the aliens erased my memory!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Wow! Casa Bonita?!
"
16,14,Jimmy,"He said ""at Ruh ruh rruh ruh Reh Red""
"
3,17,Kyle,"What's it mean?! What's it mean?!
"
1,9,Cartman,"'Cause.  He kept seeing this little brown piece of Christmas poo everywhere that he went.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Oh come on! We're not the only ones who wanted to look into this! You think, you think Kyle isn't on the computer right now tryin' to see who the poorest kid in school is?! Oh he is gonna have such a field day, that heartless Jew!  Well I won't give him the satisfaction!
"
17,2,Randy,"Yeah, I got lube right here.
"
16,14,Cartman,"No! But Obama wasn't really elected! Don't you people care?! 
"
7,8,Kyle,"Mrrh.  Mr. Garrison?
"
10,12,Cartman,"I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!
"
7,14,Kyle,"Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Aagh Ghyod, here she goes again!!
"
8,7,Stan,"I'm trying to order a double cheeseburger!
"
18,5,Kyle,"That's horrible. If that's true, I don't wanna see it.
"
12,13,Stan,"Yeah, I guess we'd better check that movie out...
"
7,1,Stan,"I'm sure you'll see that if you give our world time, it will become even more outrageous and violent.
"
8,1,Cartman,"I am Bulrog and I have lots and lots of powers.
"
1,11,Wendy,"I told her. Don't... fuck... with... Wendy... Testaburger! 
"
4,16,Butters,"No, uh Craig's here, too.
"
12,7,Butters,"We're not telling anybody! I don't wanna get in trouble! And I didn't have a super fun time anyways.
"
15,5,Cartman,"It's the easiest thing in the world! How could you guys have screwed this up?! All I asked you to do was to get Slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at Cedars-Sinai NCU!
"
1,1,Stan,"Hey Wendy, what's a dildo? 
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
12,13,Kyle,"Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
"
5,8,Kenny,"(Nooo!) 
"
12,5,Cartman,"No no. If you cheat and fail, you're a cheater. If you cheat and succeed, you're savvyyy.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, Mr. Hat! Would you stop drooling over Enrique Iglesias and... wait a minute. What did you say?
"
2,14,Kyle,"He singing some new hit song.
"
18,10,Cartman,"What?
"
6,4,Stan,"Come on, you stupid baby cows!  You have to get out of here. 
"
15,7,Randy,"No, you just don't understand Tween Wave 'cause you're old! 
"
17,6,Cartman,"Oh, Mr. Mackey, could I-Oh, uhhh. Hey, sorry, am I interrupting?
"
6,5,Stan,"Come on, let's just go! We'll kill Butters later! 
"
12,5,Cartman,"Today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat: getting material ahead of time.  When Bill Beelichick cheated for the Patriots, what did he do? He videotaped the opposing team's defense. Think of the defense as your test. When taking a test you must also videotape the defense. Learn what's on the test before they give it to you. And that way you can- 
"
12,11,Kyle,"Dude, it's a Peruvian flute band.
"
16,6,Stan,"""Really? You're gonna make us all listen to it again 'cause you couldn't understand? Really?""
"
2,15,Cartman,"Who's ""we""? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!
"
11,5,Stan,"Jesus, you did answer my prayer! 
"
10,6,Kyle,"That doesn't make any sense.
"
9,11,Kyle,"Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.
"
10,6,Stan,"Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.
"
5,7,Wendy,"Oh, we wanna hear it, Ms. Choksondik. We're excited.
"
11,5,Stan,"Right, so, why do we color eggs? 
"
12,12,Mr. Garrison,"Does that mean... maybe we overreacted?
"
2,16,Stan,"Mr. Hankey? 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! 
"
10,1,Randy,"Good-bye, Chef! Have a great time with the Super Adventure Club!
"
10,3,Kyle,"We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Lucky. 
"
14,3,Randy,"Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay. 
"
15,4,Cartman,"I don't care if Obama IS President! You don't go around putting little boys on blast, telling the whole world the length of their DICKS!
"
6,3,Cartman,"Yeah. God, I wish Kenny was still alive. He'd put balls on his chin. He was such an awesome friend.
"
16,12,Randy,"Haarrrr! 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Hooray! 
"
4,14,Cartman,"No, that's right. Only Timmy knows the part.
"
9,11,Stan,"You guys... need... anything? 
"
15,10,Cartman,"No thanks. Okay, proceed.
"
18,10,Stan,"I'm still really confused, dude. I have no idea what that was about.
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"You know. We just run around in circles and try to grab each others' asses.
"
13,4,Randy,"Yeah okay? Let's just try to have a nice dinner, okay?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Yeah, yeah, it should be a real blast, heh. I just hope Jewpacabra doesn't show up, that's all.
"
14,10,Randy,"Damn your incongruities!  I'm goin' in after my son!
"
3,8,Butters,"Nope. No way out. Buh, but there ain't nothin' upstairs but an old, stupid party anyways. It's better down here in the kids' room.  Uh, this here is Dougie. He's not too old, but he sure is a hoot to hang with. Uhuh, he's in first grade, I think.
"
5,12,Stan,"I'll kick you in the nuts, Cartman! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"I know, Kyle. I'll see ya later. 
"
10,8,Cartman,"Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!
"
6,9,Kyle,"We're just gonna fly to California and break into George Lucas's house. What's stressful about that?
"
18,6,Cartman,"That makes sense.
"
5,1,Cartman,"Hah, I love you guys.
"
16,8,Kyle,"We don't have kickoffs anymore. 
"
5,10,Kyle,"Crap. 
"
18,7,Kyle,"Fuck you!
"
6,6,Stan,"Butters, you just don't really fit in with us here. We think it's best for all of us if you for friendship opportunities elsewhere.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Really? 
"
9,6,Kyle,"All right, let's eat Colonel! 
"
3,14,Cartman,"Yes. This year, I've decided to fight for the glorious South. Screw you guys, home. And may I say that we're going to whup your ass this time.
"
4,6,Stan,"Sweet.
"
9,3,Cartman,"We represent Token.  Give us a call, we'll work out a deal.
"
10,12,Cartman,"HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!
"
7,11,Kyle,"That isn't it, Cartman.
"
16,11,Butters,"I've never done this before. 
"
18,9,Randy,"Well that's not a world Lorde ever wanted to be a part of.
"
10,6,Stan,"I know.
"
12,9,Wendy,"I'm gonna kick your ass! That's what I'm gonna do!
"
3,12,Cartman,"Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.
"
11,5,Kyle,"...I'm kind of finger painting right now.
"
2,3,Stan,"Come on, dude, it's not that hard!
"
1,9,Stan,"We committed him.
"
12,8,Stan,"Indy! 
"
4,17,Kyle,"Alright, Butters. Let's see what you've got.
"
5,5,Kyle,"They told us that ""Phillip. He's the one with talent. Just get him for Earth Day.""
"
7,3,Cartman,"We can't let her get away with this!  I think tonight we need to do something drastic.
"
7,6,Stan,"Dude, we just can't tell on them.
"
3,13,Butters,"Oowhy yu- you best do what he says, uh home-school kid. Why, this is our part of the playground, see? And uh, a-and if you don't follow our rules, whyuh, why we're gonna duct-tape ya to the bench.
"
11,12,Kyle,"The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.
"
4,8,Kyle,"Oh. Sweet, dude. I don't think we have to do this stupid debate now.  Stan?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Okay, except maybe for that one time.
"
2,12,Stan,"Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
"
8,2,Cartman,"Moooommmm?
"
11,14,Stan,"Dude, Butters, calm down.
"
17,2,Stan,"You guys are watchin' murder porn?
"
2,17,Stan,"Aooooo!
"
8,12,Cartman,"Oh, uh-uh Kelly. Kelly invited me.
"
4,4,Stan,"Wait a minute! Phil Collins sucks ass!
"
16,1,Cartman,"Exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one. It's time for us to stand together, and say, we want the government out of our bathrooms.
"
6,17,Kyle,"What's it?
"
6,17,Stan,"Jesus, Santa's sleigh was shot down over Iraq!
"
17,7,Cartman,"True, but we can't let Kyle come in the way of what's rightfully ours.  Let's face it, Lady McCormick, this is really about you and me getting XBox Ones. The others are simply there to... help us get inside those doors.
"
4,11,Cartman,"He is gonna take that ugly face and make you reasonable to look at!  Bah!
"
2,9,Cartman,"Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95! 
"
6,13,Cartman,"This sounds like a really important quest.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Come on, guys! This is the cure de gars of Butters' torture!
"
15,2,Butters,"Not again.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Wait, wait wait wait. This doesn't make sense. This whole thing doesn't make any sense. I must be-
"
12,12,Stan,"Yes, I'd like to make a noise complaint. 
"
1,6,Kenny,"(Oh my God!) 
"
15,10,Stan,"Don't let him get away!
"
7,14,Stan,"All right, you guys, it's first down. I'll hike the ball on the third ""set hut!"" Kyle and Cartman, go deep post out. Kenny, run a slant down the middle. Butters, be ready for the screen.
"
5,9,Cartman,"HA! I'm not giving a dollar to those towelheads!
"
18,1,Cartman,"Dude! There's already brand name awareness and it's instantly recognizable!
"
2,12,Cartman,"All right. You go find chicks, Kenny.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Uh if... we could just get you to sign right here? 
"
16,6,Stan,"That's when I realized nobody remembered. Nobody remembered it was me who came up with the idea to go ziplining. Me.
"
10,3,Randy,"We're alive?? We're alive! 
"
6,4,Stan,"No, this is exactly what we wanted.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Yeah?
"
8,3,Cartman,"Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we're so close to completing my final solution!
"
13,4,Randy,"HA! Read it and weep, Sharon! No more queefing!
"
18,1,Stan,"No, we don't wanna do anything.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Jakov, please don't go.  You make everything in South Park fun.  You brought life to this whole town. It would suck without you.
"
7,6,Stan,"We're gonna have to just start bringing in people for questioning.
"
12,2,Stan,"Dude, they're never gonna let us through.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy.  Tiiimmih Timmih.
"
9,6,Jimmy,"Yeah. S-see ya, Eric. 
"
6,16,Butters,"Hooray!
"
17,7,Butters,"Oh don't even get me started! I keep watchin' that show and I'm waitin' for the darn dragon to show up and, and kick everyone's butt! But all I get is wiener, wiener, wiener. It's not all gay wiener, but when they DO show a straight guy's wiener, it's all soft and floppy. Even though he just got done humpin' a pretty girl! Why is that? Because a soft wiener isn't threatening, just like a gay wiener. 
"
6,3,Butters,"Well it's just that my parents are... I can't picket!
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah. I could prance around in little tights and sing opera too, for that kind of cash.
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, partner with Butters.
"
12,4,Kyle,"Hello? Will you just give this guy something, please?!
"
7,11,Butters,"You're not a cannibal, are you?
"
15,4,Cartman,"Wait! According to that scale, I still have a small wiener!
"
11,13,Kyle,"Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. 
"
16,6,Stan,"I had no idea ziplining would be so boring.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Butters, come on!
"
16,11,Butters,"Can't you see I'm in horrible pain?! Do you have any idea what-?!
"
10,1,Stan,"Come on, let's go. 
"
7,6,Stan,"We just wanna be junior detectives.
"
13,12,Stan,"...That makes perfect sense, Butters.
"
3,16,Stan,"...So what you're saying is, this person shouldn't be bummed because everybody has their period at a different time.
"
11,7,Randy,"Harrrh!
"
4,9,Kyle,"Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!
"
16,3,Cartman,"Don't give up on Faith Hilling, Kenny. Don't you give up on her.
"
18,7,Cartman,"With what?
"
4,14,Cartman,"No, just the same old crap I always see when I close my eyes.
"
15,10,Stan,"Dude, check it out! Eavesdropper found an e-mail from Jenny Simon's boyfriend calling her ""soft-serve Simon.""
"
8,3,Kyle,"Both you guys, stop! Please. You're gonna make people hate us more!
"
2,15,Stan,"Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next! 
"
3,17,Cartman,"That's not true, Mr. Garrison: Kyle was working on his fingering with his mom all night long.
"
7,13,Cartman,"You guys have to help me!
"
8,1,Cartman,"All right, dickhole! Time for you to pay!  Oh no! I have no powers! Kyle took them away from me! Quick, Kyle, give me back my powers so I can fight this evil villain!
"
3,3,Cartman,"Uh, one.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Uh-oh.)  (Help me, Kyle! What are we gonna do?)
"
17,2,Randy,"Jaden Smith lets his parents do whatever they want. You know what? The guys at work, they took a bet on who would win in a fight, you or Jaden Smith, and they all said Jaden Smith could kick your ass! He does movies and he can sing, and he's totally cool to his parents!
"
10,3,Randy,"Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!
"
10,2,Randy,"There, like that! Stop that!
"
4,4,Stan,"Uh, Mr. Garrison, haven't you figured it out? Timmys' retarded.
"
1,11,Kyle,"How is it that Ms. Ellen was suddenly arrested for being an Iraq-
"
10,14,Randy,"OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again.
"
8,14,Kyle,"Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there.
"
15,4,Butters,"I'm hung like a horse!
"
7,3,Kenny,"(Yeah! Fuck you!)
"
8,6,Cartman,"What the hell is going on?! Are you having Mr. Jefferson over for dinner?!
"
14,2,Stan,"Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. 
"
3,12,Kyle,"The what?
"
14,2,Stan,"Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television.
"
10,8,Kyle,"We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times.
"
5,8,Randy,"What?
"
18,10,Kyle,"Really? That's what you guys would do?
"
9,9,Kyle,"Wait! I don't wanna know that!
"
2,9,Cartman,"Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that  isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!
"
1,2,Cartman,"Oooh, Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree...
"
10,13,Cartman,"I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.
"
7,9,Kyle,"Um, sir-
"
3,2,Cartman,"You guys, I mean, seriously! Get me down!
"
15,11,Randy,"Oh, yeah, it's not really what I expected.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all.
"
9,9,Wendy,"You're not ugly, Marjorine.
"
13,1,Stan,"Yeah, dude, that's gross.
"
7,11,Butters,"Are you sure?
"
1,13,Stan,"Dude, I thought you said you were Native American.
"
1,9,Stan,"Hey come on guys.  We have to go to the mall and tell Santa Claus what we want for Christmas.
"
4,6,Stan,"Dude, I don't understand this game at all.
"
18,6,Stan,"I'm sorry. I didn't really I spent that much.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I'm a dick and I'm gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!
"
3,10,Cartman,"I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...
"
11,11,Cartman,"Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!
"
6,11,Kyle,"Yeah, it was like four days ago!
"
13,6,Randy,"Ahhh actually I- I happen to be on the phone with all the world leaders- I- I can ask. Uh yeah, listen, these, uh, police aliens are here, and they're wondering if anyone's seen an alien named Baby Fark McGee-zax.
"
13,4,Cartman,"Yes, that's good.
"
15,8,Kyle,"Alright, look. I honestly don't know the secret, dude. Only Cartman does, and that's how it's gonna work for us.
"
13,8,Cartman,"Good job Ike! 
"
2,7,Cartman,"You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here forever.
"
11,8,Kyle,"I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov.
"
1,11,Kyle,"Wendy! You didn't!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Yeah dude! You'll be just like Jared!
"
3,15,Kyle,"Dad.
"
16,9,Cartman,"I ain't done with you, bitch!
"
15,4,Cartman,"What?
"
16,14,Stan,"Huh?
"
11,11,Stan,"KYLE!! 
"
6,6,Cartman,"Yes. Well, Butters, it's just not working out.
"
5,14,Butters,"Da-ad? Da-ad??  Are you wrestlin' in here?  Dad?
"
15,14,Cartman,"Mom, how are you going to start bringing more money into this household?
"
4,14,Wendy,"...Helen! 
I think our baby's deaf and blind. Oh no!
"
13,12,Stan,"Isn't this awesome, you guys? I haven't seen a Harley for like three days.
"
12,11,Cartman,"Well do you mind tellin' us what you're doing on an ancient Incan wall, Craig?
"
9,3,Stan,"So unfair... so unfair.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Today this Jewish boy and all sinners are going to be saved-uh! Kyle, do you believe in God-uh?
"
11,6,Butters,"You have to be careful with scissors.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Yes, but you can live if you give me your Jew gold! The decision is yours, Kyle!
"
17,9,Cartman,"Well, clearly she wouldn't be marrying Tom Hanks at Red Robin if she was.
"
3,9,Kyle,"What is that?
"
12,14,Butters,"Hey Dad. 
"
7,8,Stan,"Dude, I can't wait for Wendy to see how gay I look!
"
5,8,Kyle,"What terrifying secret?
"
4,12,Cartman,"What??
"
14,10,Stan,"Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yummy yummy thank you Cartman. 
"
1,10,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, I think I left your oven on, too.
"
5,9,Stan,"Well alright. 
"
7,8,Randy,"You're looking ultra-fabulous.
"
11,10,Cartman,"No! No, he has to suck my balls!  NO! KYYYYLE! 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Unfortunate accident? You mean, like Geena Davis getting her own TV show?  Oh.
"
5,6,Stan,"You'll see! We'll get in! 
"
1,5,Stan,"Hey Kyle, what's that elephant doing?
"
14,2,Butters,"Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did.
"
4,6,Kenny,"(What?)
"
5,3,Cartman,"This is for your own good, Brother Kyle.
"
11,12,Stan,"Hello?  Hello? Anybody? 
"
11,7,Kyle,"Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!
"
4,9,Cartman,"I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you...  pretend to use your finger like a gun or something.
"
6,16,Stan,"Hide and go seek, huh?!
"
12,6,Randy,"Well at least that part's like the Internet.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Sure you will, Cartman. Sure you will.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Now go! Go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes! We will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in! Now I am not gonna live my life as a Goddamned minority! Are you with me?!
"
4,4,Kyle,"Come, see him with us.
"
16,4,Cartman,"We were wrong! I'm sorry God I'll be Jewish I promise! Please don't kill me! Don't kill me! Doooo...! 
"
11,9,Stan,"Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours.
"
16,3,Stan,"Okay, that's good, a little higher.
"
17,3,Cartman,"No! My wife, Token! Token, that's my wife!
"
12,7,Stan,"I don't know. 
"
8,5,Butters,"Ah, hey fellas! Ah, I see you met my robot.
"
10,9,Mr. Mackey,"Huh?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Well, look. Those perverts aren't going to rest until they've made love to one of us. Right? So,... somebody's just gonna have to go out there and... take one for the team.  And I think, in all fairness, it should be Butters. 
"
12,14,Butters,"Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.
"
6,15,Stan,"I'm not here for a reading, I just need to ask him something real quick.
"
13,14,Kyle,"So what?
"
17,2,Kyle,"Look everybody, I know we all feel our hands are tied, but the fact is, we can do something about this. There's an app which can actually allow kids to block things that their parents watch on television. And it is password-protected with a security code that only a child would know.
"
8,2,Cartman,"Naaaa! Daaaaa!
"
4,14,Cartman,"I don't know.  I don't know, you guys! Alright, maybe I tried to have Timmy's turkey crushed by a stage light, but I didn't do anything else. I'm not an asshole.
"
18,7,Butters,"Yeah.
"
17,1,Kyle,"Will you please take your rally conversation somewhere else?
"
9,14,Randy,"Oh. Well, tell you what: let's leave the car here, walk home, and watch the game. Like to have another beer or two.
"
6,7,Cartman,"H'you guys! Come quick!  You won't believe it!
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"I can live with that.
"
13,8,Stan,"Mr. Jackson, you can't do this! This is not your body!
"
18,7,Kyle,"Alright, here it goes. Cartman, you aren't really here.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Thank you very uh- wah? Myrrh album?
"
15,6,Butters,"This... is Butters. It's Wednesday night at 9 p.m. From what I understand, there are people living inside my head and they want to kill me. It must be true, because now every night I wet the bed. So tonight I'm gonna leave the camera on to see what exactly I become while I am sleeping.
"
12,7,Kyle,"What's that?
"
2,6,Cartman,"Yeah. I didn't wanna do it, Jesus. They made me do that.
"
8,10,Stan,"What?!
"
1,9,Kyle,"I can see its head!
"
4,7,Stan,"There's nothing more I can do, Kenny. I've tried everything to save Kyle. Holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend!
"
4,11,Stan,"What?
"
9,12,Cartman,"Stan, don't you know the first law of physics? Anything that's fun costs at least eight dollars.
"
9,6,Butters,"Huh but I thought you were one!
"
2,17,Cartman,"What?!
"
3,6,Kyle,"That people shouldn't sue each other all the time.
"
6,3,Butters,"Eh now gosh darnit, fellas, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead.
"
5,13,Stan,"The principal? Aw, come on!
"
9,12,Randy,"Stanley, do you have any concept of money at all? Money doesn't grow on trees, you know?
"
9,10,Kyle,"Keep running! 
"
14,9,Kyle,"It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing.
"
8,5,Butters,"AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin' some kind of malfunction.  AWESOM-O? Hey, where'd ya go? 
"
4,2,Kenny,"(You guys! You guys, over here! ...Hey!)
"
16,13,Randy,"Oh I feel like such an idiot.
"
11,3,Kyle,"I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it.
"
15,13,Kyle,"Um... so...  So dual citizenship, wow, uh... You know that I, I never knew anyone that had that.
"
17,2,Cartman,"Butters' dad killed his mom. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"You sons of bitches! 
"
8,11,Kyle,"Maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or they'll die.
"
8,10,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus. You told him that?! 
"
6,6,Butters,"Heeyyy, what are you doin'?  Aaaah! You may have won this time! But I will be back!
"
2,12,Wendy,"You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.
"
2,18,Stan,"He's alive!
"
9,6,Butters,"Well, well, you know, the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace, sometimes, you have to atone for something bad you did.
"
16,11,Cartman,"Butters just got on a bus with his backpack and said he's going to Hawaii.
"
5,3,Kyle,"""David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic."" Dude, we gotta go.
"
18,8,Kyle,"Yeah, maybe that just kind of what they do naturally.
"
5,4,Cartman,"A little penis-biting, perhaps?
"
10,9,Kyle,"Uh, Mr. President, my name is-
"
7,10,Randy,"That's our Grandpa. 
"
18,7,Butters,"Huh. But...  you guys can't be here.
"
11,9,Randy,"Yeah, I'm...  I'm good!  Feel a lot better.
"
7,12,Kyle,"Yeah. Did you make out with him, too?
"
2,3,Cartman,"God, shut up, dude.
"
5,4,Kyle,"One please.
"
6,9,Kyle,"You yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films. You understand why films shouldn't be changed.
"
9,2,Cartman,"The college know-it-all hippies.
"
11,14,Stan,"Just for a minute. Over here. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Yes, yes, what a beautiful night! It is Saturday the 12th at 10:45, and my mother is away at a party right now.
"
17,6,Cartman,"But it's not true. Kyle, I'm being serious. I really think I have to tell the truth! I I don't know how I can live with this. I don't think I can unless eh, unless I don't know mm-maybe you c-called your mom a fat skank?  Maybe if you'd said that to your mom and... told her that her tits belonged in a morgue, then, maybe somehow I could live with this lie.
"
1,12,Cartman,"Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it. I'll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as you can...
"
8,11,Stan,"Come on, doesn't anybody have any show ideas?
"
13,11,Stan,"Well, 'cause then we're just douchebags, dude. Come on, they're right here. Let, let's get hardcore!
"
10,1,Kyle,"Just what the hell is that thing?!
"
3,8,Stan,"Oh no, we're out of time!  Are you sure you can do this, Butters?
"
10,8,Stan,"Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time.
"
18,5,Butters,"What the heck are you doing?!
"
14,9,Kyle,"What are you talking about?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Jewpaca- look, it's nothing. Forget I said anything.
"
3,15,Stan,"to make it spin.
"
10,3,Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?
"
2,9,Stan,"She's not my girlfriend.
"
1,10,Stan,"You did, Jesus. 
"
11,10,Stan,"Come on, guys. 
"
2,18,Stan,"Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
"
3,3,Stan,"And a chef hat.
"
4,9,Kenny,"(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)
"
7,13,Stan,"Yeah, what's the problem?
"
13,8,Kyle,"It's all just in your head, Ike.
"
8,1,Stan,"We might pass him off as our pet.
"
7,3,Kyle,"I'm confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality test?
"
18,1,Butters,"We finally did it!
"
9,13,Cartman,"Uh oh.
"
4,1,Kyle,"On the sled, fatass!
"
1,7,Cartman,"Then, there won't be anyone to give us candy!  Aaah!
"
1,8,Cartman,"Hey! Hey seriously! Hey, you're pissing me off, Starvin' Marvin! 
"
7,12,Stan,"It's just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.
"
7,14,Mr. Garrison,"All right, kids! Out on the gym floor for P.E. class. 
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh, that'd be awesome! 
"
1,1,Cartman,"Oh!! Whoa, I sure am hungry.
"
11,13,Stan,"Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!
"
1,9,Cartman,"Yeah.  We'll see you later, Kyle.  Guess there's no reason for you to come, since you don't get Christmas presents.
"
2,15,Kyle,"You said you could get us money, Cartman!
"
14,4,Cartman,"Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas.  Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?
"
6,5,Butters,"Oh boy, uh, Oh Jeez, Oh Jeez
"
15,7,Stan,"Sounds like shit.
"
12,11,Randy,"Oh God, what are we gonna dooo?
"
9,14,Stan,"Because, I don't want everyone knowing, okay? Could we please just keep this to ourselves?
"
2,8,Stan,"Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked out of town for doing drugs.
"
13,8,Kyle,"Aw dide, this is hopeless!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Kyle, what are you doing?
"
3,10,Kyle,"Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. 
"
16,7,Butters,"Yes, they will.
"
8,8,Jimmy,"Gee, th-they're both screamingly funny, fellas. Better give it another ten seconds. All right, now we'll see which one really has staying power. Number one?
"
3,12,Stan,"What are you guys doing out here?
"
17,10,Butters,"See ya, Lisa! 
"
1,13,Cartman,"Hi guys.
"
13,7,Butters,"Have a good day! 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Goddamnit, stop! I'm real! I'm real!
"
12,13,Cartman,"Shut up, Scott Malkinson. ""I'm Scott Malkinson. I've got a lisp and I've got diabetes.""
"
8,3,Cartman,"Mel Gibson's The Passion Fan Club.
"
15,5,Cartman,"I ain't arguin'. If they got paid, then how did we make all owr money, right?
"
8,4,Stan,"Hey guys. Uh- You guys know how to dance, right?
"
6,6,Cartman,"Five times one is of course...
"
3,12,Stan,"Alright, let's just set her over here behind these boxes. 
"
3,2,Cartman,"What?!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Yeah, you guys are real hard core.
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Yeah, I know, dude.)
"
9,2,Cartman,"Put them in my laptop! 
"
6,6,Butters,"Yes. Look around for your precious eraser. You won't find it. That eraser's in my back yard, buried three feet below the surface of the earth.  And do you even suspect me?? No! Now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser.  And information, it just keeps pilin' up and pilin' up, until your minuscule brains can take it no longer! 
"
4,12,Cartman,"Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, do we really need all this potty talk in the classroom?
"
5,13,Stan,"Why would God let Kenny die, Chef? Why? Kenny's my fr-f-f-friend. Why can't God take someone else's f-f-friend?
"
2,10,Kyle,"Chef, we wanna know about herpes.
"
9,4,Cartman,"You see your honor, I was the only one that Kenny McCormick told his wishes to. And Kenny told me specifically that he would never want to be kept alive on a machine. What they're doing to him ...is not right.
"
10,4,Cartman,"Wha?  What are they?
"
14,1,Kyle,"I guess it... feels great. Thanks. 
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late.  You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss.
"
4,1,Cartman,"You will?
"
2,10,Kyle,"We're sorry.
"
4,15,Stan,"Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?
"
2,3,Stan,"I can't see, dude!
"
13,2,Cartman,"And of course the most common question asked is, just who is he?  Is he a hero or a menace?  While we can all admit that the Coon is obviously really cool, we should also be asking each other... ""Why does he care so much for the people of this town? Why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime? And does he really have the right?"" What we all need now-  Clyde? Clyde, could you wake up please? This is important.  What we all need now is PROOF... that the Coon exists. I believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 5:45 the Coon is going to be on the roof of Walgreens. I know I'll be there with my camera. And I'm sure... many of you will, too.
"
15,6,Butters,"What? Why would I do that?
"
18,10,Kyle,"We?
"
6,9,Cartman,"Yeah, we want our money back!
"
2,2,Cartman,"What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?
"
14,4,Kyle,"You don't get sucked into it! You don't get sucked in at all! Plehehehehehehehese!
"
16,10,Randy,"Yeah, I'm thinking maybe Gerald's house is nicer than mine is.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Give me that!  Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
"
6,16,Cartman,"¡La caca de moreno no es aquí! ¡Aquí es verde, señor! ¡Es verde! ¡Arriba arriba!
"
5,8,Stan,"Yeah. Hey Mom, Cartman found a bloody cotton thing in the bathroom.
"
18,6,Cartman,"Jimmy told me about this game.
"
7,12,Stan,"But that's just you and your friends.
"
14,2,Kyle,"Yes!
"
17,2,Randy,"We heard that... you're willing to teach Minecraft to adults?
"
1,5,Cartman,"I'm just saying you're just a little wuss, that's all.
"
13,10,Cartman,"All right!
"
18,6,Cartman,"How do you get people addicted to crack? You give it away for free. You give away a little taste and then... and then some people... can't stop themselves.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Alright guys, we're gonna need some video cameras. We gotta go out at night and try to get proof of this thing.
"
12,7,Butters,"No! 
"
2,12,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman!
"
9,1,Stan,"Jesus Christ, dude!
"
1,4,Stan,"Sparky! Sparky!
"
12,9,Kyle,"No, really. We've always thought you suck.
"
7,11,Butters,"Wha...? Where is there a bomb shelter??
"
7,7,Randy,"We have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture.
"
3,8,Mr. Garrison,"Great party, Mr. Mackey. Mr. Hat just grabbed Principal Victoria's ass.  No! Mr. Hat, you get back here! 
"
11,5,Kyle,"I don't believe it.
"
12,3,Stan,"Do you feel anything?
"
4,10,Cartman,"A- And as long as we get this Communion thing, we're safe?
"
6,5,Butters,"Hey fellas. I got the tampons. Uh, I didn't miss it, did I?
"
15,13,Kyle,"No, ah I don't.
"
2,8,Stan,"Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves.
"
1,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uhuh. That's a good start, why else?
"
10,14,Stan,"All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie.
"
6,14,Randy,"Ah, here's a good one.  It's the stereotypical ""sleepy Mexican."" 
"
12,6,Kyle,"I have to get online before school.
"
2,4,Cartman,"Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman.
"
7,6,Kyle,"We were happy playing Laundromat Owners.
"
4,4,Stan,"I feel... different.
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Aaaaaa!) 
"
9,6,Butters,"Hurry. Go, go! 
"
6,10,Butters,"Cool!  That was the most perfect throw I've ever seen.
"
10,8,Kyle,"Okay, right behind Stan.
"
7,10,Kyle,"Ech, even if it could work, how would we go about shutting it down?
"
14,3,Stan,"The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat.
"
6,1,Cartman,"That's right Stan.  It's a cash cow, I tell you.
"
8,9,Cartman,"Nuh-uh.
"
2,16,Randy,"Sure. We'll punish you after the holidays.
"
10,2,Stan,"What is that?
"
9,5,Kyle,"What?
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Oh no!)
"
6,4,Cartman,"Stan, could you hurry it up? I'm freezing my ass off.
"
6,10,Kyle,"Right.
"
8,6,Cartman,"Yeah?
"
7,6,Stan,"That's right.  But they didn't say anything about going in the back.
"
8,8,Cartman,"It's the best choice, and me and Butters are sticking with it.
"
8,10,Stan,"Shelly  Somebody is going to kill me, and I can't go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you're kind of the only person I have... left. 
"
18,9,Randy,"I was told to!
"
4,2,Stan,"How much do we get if we work for you?
"
3,5,Cartman,"I have to go number two.
"
12,3,Cartman,"All right, this should keep my cat in place while he spreads the urine.  Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? 
"
8,6,Cartman,"Oh, kick ass! Dude, why isn't my house like this?!
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
6,1,Kyle,"Them?
"
14,6,Cartman,"Gingers? No!
"
17,6,Cartman,"You what??
"
16,6,Stan,"No, we're not leaving you here, Kyle!
"
7,12,Stan,"Wow, you made this?
"
7,3,Cartman,"Hm.
"
7,1,Kenny,"(Gaaahaha, he got you again!)
"
5,1,Kyle,"Cartman, this is serious!!!
"
13,11,Randy,"Hey pal.  Sorry your birthday got a little ruined by the Japanese.
"
1,10,Stan,"Dude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.
"
8,9,Randy,"I came because I wanted to make sure nobody was shopping here.
"
10,8,Kyle,"Cast on him again.
"
2,10,Kyle,"But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
"
2,2,Mr. Garrison,"Mephesto's been shot. 
"
1,11,Stan,"Bluuuch 
"
2,11,Cartman,"This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it?  Hey, where is your regional champsionship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?  Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?  Apparently, only I do.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Ey!
"
11,7,Kenny,"(Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)
"
4,13,Cartman,"Alright, alright.  Kyle...
"
1,5,Stan,"No!  Shelly bad, you good.  He's tearing up the house, stop him!  Come on Kyle, Cartman. 
"
5,1,Cartman,"Guess.
"
17,2,Stan,"What's up dude?
"
1,7,Stan,"You know, I've really learned something today. Halloween isn't about costumes, or candy. It's about being good to one another, and giving and loving.
"
13,14,Kyle,"All right,  check it out, I-  Butters, BUTTERS. What the fuck?! Are you peeing in the pool?!
"
11,14,Stan,"It didn't sparkle with all the girls. We have the real list. 
"
9,8,Randy,"Stan, you're alive!
"
5,9,Cartman,"Uh oh! Mmm-mm! 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Shh!  I just need to uh make Butters think I'm a robot for a little while longer.
"
13,11,Cartman,"We always have.
"
9,6,Butters,"Lu lu lu, I've got some apples. Lu lu lu, you've got some too-
"
3,1,Stan,"Wow!
"
10,2,Kyle,"...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... 
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Wow, what a terrific audience. Isn't this great.  Can I get another wuhwuh wha wha what what?  And now it's time to give out the award for the least funny people in the world. And the nominees are: 
"
6,5,Cartman,"God, I hate old people!
"
12,10,Stan,"One of our friends was raped in Peru. It was very traumatic. 
"
8,3,Kyle,"Naw uh!
"
5,5,Kyle,"Uuuh, we didn't get them.
"
12,1,Cartman,"NO! NOOOOOOOO!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Look, Stan, you want me to just take care of this egg?
"
6,6,Jimmy,"Yeah well, I guess I'll be seeing you, you friends later. 
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Mmkay.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom. 
"
15,7,Stan,"Do you have anything on the menu that doesn't taste like shit?
"
1,3,Stan,"Where's my Uncle Jimbo and Ned?
"
2,6,Kyle,"Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!
"
16,7,Kyle,"You are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we aren't a couple!
"
6,14,Randy,"We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?
"
2,15,Stan,"Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people.
"
8,8,Stan,"But, Mr. Garrison, if we change our mascot, that means the eco-terrorists win!
"
15,4,Wendy,"Thank God.
"
1,6,Randy,"Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won.
"
8,8,Cartman,"You see, what Turd Sandwich brings to our school, Clyde, is a complete package. The turd and the bread. And the lettuce, and the olives.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Damnit! Her boyfriend's here! Don't you believe me?!
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Me too.)
"
18,10,Randy,"I guess... one step at a time.
"
1,13,Cartman,"No, Kitty, that's a bad kitty!!
"
10,8,Cartman,"All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh...
"
8,3,Cartman,"Es ist Zeit fër Rache!
"
5,9,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
18,9,Cartman,"Shooting for a D in a game of Horsedick.
"
11,11,Cartman,"Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle.  It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls.
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"You're still aren't entertaining ideas of raping me in this prison cell, are you, Chef?
"
14,1,Kyle,"Hello?
"
2,12,Randy,"Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.
"
7,9,Kyle,"Christian rock?!
"
8,11,Kyle,"Ah!
"
11,2,Butters,"Whoa boy! Camp!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Wow! He looks great!
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uh but, but Wendy, Kim Kardashian is considered to be extremely beautiful, mkay?
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Here you go.  Here you  go. Don't forget to...  vote, everyone.  Here you go, fellas. Be sure to get these handed in tomorrow.
"
9,12,Randy,"Yeah, well just like the rest of us, you have to make choices with your money. Do you want a bike, or do you not want to be depressed?
"
7,6,Stan,"Hello, ma'am, we're detectives with the South Park Crime Unit. Do you have any crimes you need to be solved, for a dollar?
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Um... okay. How about this:  Adam Sandler is like, in love with some girl, but then it turns out that the girl is actually a... golden retriever, or something.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Which is why we have to fake that boy's death. It's simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.
"
16,5,Butters,"Naw, I don't want kids calling me a Cliché Conflict Resolution Kevin.
"
14,4,Cartman,"Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?
"
12,9,Cartman,"Wendy, you need to calm down. You're gonna get your boobs all angry and they're gonna start killing everyone.  Dude, I'm on fire today!
"
1,9,Kyle,"Shut up, fat boy!
"
4,4,Stan,"Sure was, Dad.
"
1,10,Cartman,"YOU SON OF A BITCH! 
"
3,16,Kyle,"How do know that?
"
17,6,Stan,"You like... how they smell? How they taste?
"
9,1,Kyle,"Yeah! 
"
5,8,Kyle,"I don't care! You'd better remember where your base is!
"
3,6,Kenny,"(You guys, come get this fucking magnet noooowwww!)  (Argh--!)
"
2,10,Stan,"Well, you sure seem happy about it!
"
4,9,Cartman,"I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', ""Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!""
"
17,9,Cartman,"No. Whose betrayal is this? 
"
4,1,Kyle,"Me too.
"
6,9,Stan,"Oh, cool. A preview. 
"
6,12,Randy,"No, it's... alright, Sheila. The boys were just... building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend, Kenny.
"
11,10,Kyle,"All right I've had enough! Leprechauns are imaginary!
"
16,2,Stan,"Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work.
"
17,2,Cartman,"That's more like it.
"
18,5,Butters,"Now everyone is gonna know what we were doing!
"
10,2,Randy,"You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!
"
4,17,Stan,"Dude, change the channel. This is too depressing. 
"
17,6,Kenny,"(Huh? Like what?)
"
12,7,Butters,"No.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Uh, that's Gobbles, the physically challenged turkey. 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Answer it! 
"
6,13,Cartman,"Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. 
"
1,6,Stan,"Aw, dammit!
"
1,9,Kyle,"Hello, everybodyyy.
"
6,13,Stan,"This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
"
6,1,Butters,"Mom. Dad.
"
2,5,Cartman,"I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll! 
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Now Eric, whatever it is you and Token are going through, you need to talk through it, m'kay? The problems you two are havin' have become a distraction for everybody else. Agreed?
"
12,8,Butters,"Uhwhat?
"
8,10,Stan,"We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn't think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn't think and now he's gonna kill us!
"
5,13,Stan,"This whole time, you were just using Kenny's illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses?
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, well excuse me, Kyle! Why don't you just forget what Barnaby Jones has to say?! Why don't you not pay attention to Barnaby Jones and then let's see how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones knew the poison was in the milk?
"
3,4,Stan,"Well, I mean, that's what was on the news.
"
5,12,Cartman,"I'll make you eat your parents!
"
14,2,Butters,"Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?
"
1,1,Wendy,"Hey, what's that?
"
5,3,Stan,"This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they're miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he's totally awesome!
"
12,8,Cartman,"They're taking over our country, Butters! This is life or death now! Help! Me!
"
12,1,Kyle,"Don't. Touch me.
"
15,9,Butters,"So then, so then the fireman says ""That won't even fit in my scrotum!""  Yeah!
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"UUUUUuuuuuugh
"
4,9,Stan,"Come on, nobody's gonna notice.
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"Damnit, this is not Japan!!
"
5,14,Butters,"Hello? Eh-anybody in here?
"
4,13,Cartman,"Agh--! 
"
8,11,Stan,"Dude, I think we can do a little better than crab people.
"
2,12,Stan,"Better than yours, fat boy.
"
16,6,Stan,"The boat went really slow and it just went round and round.
"
12,11,Kyle,"Yeah. Stuff just happens.
"
5,6,Stan,"Dude, just forget about it. We can't let him get to us, or he wins.
"
13,14,Stan,"After this, you guys wanna hit the hurricane slides?
"
18,3,Cartman,"Alright, that does it!  I'm sick of this shit and I'm not gonna be  taking it any longer!  You all pushed me to this! 
"
2,8,Cartman,"Ugh... Whatever. 
"
2,15,Cartman,"Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!
"
12,3,Kenny,"(All set.)
"
14,2,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?
"
6,9,Stan,"Well what's wrong with it?
"
13,7,Cartman,"Quiet, you sons of biscuit eaters! This boat is now pirate propertih! Now get ye to your lifeboat, lest you wanna be shark bait!
"
6,10,Stan,"Hey, that's what I wrote about!
"
13,11,Stan,"What the hell is that? 
"
13,14,Cartman,"Wave pool! Wave pool! Waaave pooool!  Oh, what the hell?! 
"
2,17,Kyle,"I don't like big corporations.
"
12,8,Stan,"I don't need this now.  I just want things to be the way they were! 
"
18,9,Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah! CartmanBrah! Be sure to subscribe to my channel, brahs.
"
10,3,Kyle,"Nooooo! 
"
3,2,Cartman,"What?
"
18,8,Cartman,"Ten darra?! 
"
1,5,Kyle,"Does it look like a pig, or an elephant?
"
7,5,Stan,"Dude, do you really he would go through all this just to make us feel dumb?
"
5,2,Timmy,"Aaaaaaah! 
"
4,2,Stan,"We can't do that, dude. Loogie will kick our asses.
"
16,6,Cartman,"Yeah. 
"
6,3,Cartman,"The present.
"
9,14,Stan,"No, Dad, people will see!
"
1,3,Kenny,"(Maybe she'll suck my dick)
"
7,12,Stan,"So, how'd it go, Clubber Lange? You kicked Mr. Harrison's ass?
"
3,1,Cartman,"Mister! You've gotta help me! I'm starving to death!
"
3,8,Stan,"Oh, dude, you've gotta be kidding me.
"
11,12,Cartman,"No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!
"
14,9,Kyle,"I can hide it!  Nobody ever has to know!  I can't ever let anybody know!
"
17,10,Wendy,"You guys stop it! Okay Lisa, that's great. But you need to have more confidence, okay?
"
18,6,Kyle,"Hey dude.
"
7,4,Cartman,"And I am the official messenger boy, I am.
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"What did he say?!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Man, that new version must have sucked balls.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike, there's been a mistake. You don't understand.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Aaah! Ten dollar!  Ten dollar, soldier boy!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Hand me the modeling glue. We need more fur over here. 
"
16,5,Kyle,"Fine! But when you're naked and jackin' it in San Diego, don't ask me for help! 
"
12,9,Cartman,"I'll eat my underwear, Wendy.  And then you'll be satisfied. We can put this whole thing behind us.
"
3,8,Stan,"Whoa, cool!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Don't fight it, Kyle, it will only take longer. Just slip into sweet unconsciousness. 
"
13,3,Stan,"Well can't I just return it and get the money my dad put in back?
"
13,9,Butters,"Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him.
"
11,8,Kyle,"Grrhh, whatever. 
"
15,6,Butters,"It's okay, Billy, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
"
16,6,Cartman,"Zipliiine. 
"
18,9,Mr. Mackey,"Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office, please? Eric Cartman's commenter window to the principal's office!
"
5,10,Stan,"I didn't smile. 
"
15,4,Kyle,"Thirteen point seven inches?
"
17,10,Stan,"Oh, hey Wendy. Clyde sent me these. Don't be jel.
"
11,8,Cartman,"I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! 
"
10,13,Cartman,"Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! 
"
14,1,Kenny,"(Who fuckin' cares?)
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Sure, if you like the sound of a peacock getting its neck broken.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Yeah, maybe starting a detective club isn't such a bright idea.
"
11,12,Butters,"GAA HAA!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Uh, yes?
"
4,9,Cartman,"The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! 
"
2,7,Stan,"The bus is going over!
"
11,11,Stan,"The Imagination song?
"
13,10,Kyle,"Oh my God... Oh my God...
"
10,4,Cartman,"I I said ""thank you."" Thank you for listening. 
"
7,6,Cartman,"Your story is full of holes and I'm gonna beat your ass if you don't start tellin' the truth! 
"
8,5,Butters,"All right AWESOM-O, time for us to get some sleep.  Hey, you want me to teach you some bedtime songs? If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me. Ooo-oo-oooo-oo-oo...
"
5,9,Cartman,"That's right!
"
8,9,Cartman,"You heard what?
"
11,6,Cartman,"¿Que paso? ¿Que paso? Looking for work? Sí? Trabajo?
"
13,10,Kyle,"This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. 
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Hat is just a puppet.
"
18,2,Randy,"Are you crazy?
"
2,3,Stan,"What's it say? What's it say?
"
17,10,Stan,"Wendy, why is it such a big deal?
"
16,1,Randy,"So ridiculous.
"
7,3,Kyle,"I don't know what to do.  Part of me feels like I wanna end it all now.  Tell people what heppened. You know, I never knew how beautiful this pond was before.  So cold. The world can feel like that.  So calm on the outside, as if nothing bad ever happens.  Ow.  What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
"
17,9,Stan,"Yes?
"
14,3,Randy,"What do we want?
"
16,6,Cartman,"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
9,3,Stan,"You do? 
"
10,14,Randy,"What are we goin' to do, Sharon??
"
5,14,Butters,"""Fisting Firemen 9""  I've never seen 1 through 8.
"
18,2,Randy,"Stan! ...Hey! ...How's my boy? Daddy's gonna be all right. Okay?
"
4,7,Stan,"Sshhh!
"
6,7,Kyle,"See? We're just watching cartoons, like always. Nothing's changed.
"
18,6,Cartman,"Everyone we know says they heard about it from you!
"
8,11,Butters,"Woo. We aren't havin' a party.
"
15,11,Randy,"Subliminal messages?
"
6,6,Cartman,"If you were our friend, how would you keep us entertained?
"
4,11,Cartman,"He walks-uh!
"
12,13,Jimmy,"School again.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Where do we go? 
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh hey Randy.
"
12,7,Stan,"If'n you all was to have such a giant safe, what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck?
"
7,8,Kyle,"No Mr. President!! Don't do it!  Help!
"
8,5,Butters,"Yeah. One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Timmaay! 
"
1,5,Stan,"Yes…
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Pu-put it on!!
"
7,15,Cartman,"Kyle, I just want you to know, if it were any other time of the year, I still wouldn't help you. 
"
4,7,Stan,"That's alright. If you'll all help, I think I have a plan.
"
2,13,Stan,"We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go. 
"
4,2,Stan,"Yeah, but, it's okay! We can still get our Sega Dreamcast!
"
1,3,Kyle,"Look!
"
2,11,Cartman,"Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric.
"
2,6,Stan,"Whoa!
"
3,2,Kyle,"Hey! My dad's pretty cool, too.
"
5,8,Kenny,"(I don't know. Where could it be?)
"
14,6,Cartman,"Them who?!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Hey Kenny! You got herpes, dude! Ah I almost touched him.  Zi-  Oh, sick Kenny! No! Gross.
"
6,2,Stan,"Mr. Ski Instructor, I need a lot of training, fast. I'm gonna race down the K-13.
"
1,5,Stan,"I bet he weighs four hundred pounds.
"
5,8,Stan,"Oh God, don't care, don't care.
"
10,1,Kyle,"Here! 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
6,3,Butters,"Ho-old on a minute, guys, I've changed my mind. I don't wanna go.
"
8,7,Stan,"Timecist?
"
2,15,Stan,"Do I have to?
"
2,12,Stan,"Who?
"
2,15,Kenny,"(Uh huh!)
"
6,5,Kyle,"Just don't mess with it, Cartman.
"
15,6,Butters,"But you said to uh, but I got to uh, and then, you told me tuh...
"
4,2,Cartman,"Yeah! This is so tits!
"
7,6,Cartman,"You did?
"
9,2,Cartman,"Come on, come on!
"
2,11,Cartman,"I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!
"
1,1,Stan,"Uh, Chef.
"
4,13,Kenny,"(Awww..!)  (Argh--!) 
"
17,9,Stan,"What? 
"
2,9,Cartman,"This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?
"
5,8,Cartman,"We're never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?
"
12,8,Kyle,"NOO!  Noo. No. Awwh.  Aw no...
"
10,12,Butters,"Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!
"
18,7,Butters,"Suppornity window dropped. 
"
2,4,Cartman,"Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"""But teacher, I don't want to do my math problems.""
"
9,11,Stan,"More ginger kids. Um, meh-maybe we should just go home.
"
9,4,Kenny,"(Yes! Woohoo! I did it! I reached level s-!) 
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Well, your brother is Canadian. Perhaps Canadian puberty is a little different. Why don't you educate yourself about Canadian puberty and it could be somethin' yeeyou and your brother can actually do together. M'kay?  You know, this is the first time I've been able to do counseling aaand go to the bathroom at the same time. IntelliLink is amazing.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Whassat?
"
18,8,Cartman,"Yeah so, sorry you're not getting any spectators, but there's hardcore dude shit to watch.
"
10,6,Stan,"Who?
"
14,9,Kyle,"All right, all right. 
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Con te...)
"
1,7,Kyle,"Oh, good. Kenny's back to normal.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hello? Soldier boy. Me so horny. Me love you long time.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Ironic how?
"
4,2,Cartman,"What? That your parents lied to you, too?
"
5,13,Kyle,"Stan?  Stan, where are you going?
"
6,16,Cartman,"That is so awesome!! Thank you God!  Oh praise God!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Nah, I'll lose it for sure. You keep track of it, Kyle.
"
3,10,Stan,"Oh... Wait.  Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes.
"
3,13,Randy,"Mr. Cotswolds, we can't completely control what our kids do socially. That's..., you know, that's for them to figure out on their own.
"
17,7,Butters,"Yeah, I know. Winter is comin' and there's dragons and zombies on the way. I'm pretty excited for that. Just could do with a little less gay wiener is all.
"
15,10,Kyle,"If it's on the school network we can track the IP address.  This way. In here.  Whoever it is using the computer in the music room.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Ike, you're okay. 
"
6,2,Stan,"Well I'm... catchin' on pretty fast, I guess.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Some hadka fish, some gafagga...
"
10,2,Butters,"Well he is.
"
13,10,Stan,"Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?
"
4,9,Kyle,"Since Abraham, fatass!
"
13,11,Stan,"Whoa, wait wait, we don't wanna just lie about stuff.
"
6,15,Stan,"I'm saying this to you, John Edward, you are a liar, you are a fake, and you are the biggest douche ever!
"
17,6,Cartman,"Thank you, Butters! 
"
12,8,Butters,"Herro, prease.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Shit! Asshole!  'Scuse me. 
"
14,14,Randy,"WAH! Sharon!
"
8,14,Kyle,"Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus.
"
14,1,Cartman,"Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! 
"
6,3,Butters,"Uh, it sure is!
"
14,4,Stan,"Fine! 
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"No war, m'kay?! No war, m'kay?! Oh uh, here you go, boys.  These will help you protest. It's good to see that you care about peace, boys, m'kay? No war, m'kay?!
"
18,7,Butters,"I'm sorry, Eric, but there's just one thing I gotta do real quick. 
"
2,7,Stan,"Sure. I definitely don't wanna sleep anymore. See you later. 
"
6,4,Kyle,"What??
"
7,15,Kyle,"Wull yeah, but ah-I got my brother back.
"
13,6,Randy,"Hey ah ah, any of you other countries see any space cash?
"
1,12,Mr. Garrison,"We're doomed! Good-bye, Mr. Hat.
"
9,12,Stan,"But then, why me? Why do you need me to write something so badly?
"
7,13,Cartman,"Uh what... what does that mean, ""I'll be dead""? Hey, uh what, what was that ""dead"" part?
"
17,10,Wendy,"But Lisa, that's great! Have you told Butters that you like him?
"
11,4,Kyle,"God damn it Cartman!
"
9,2,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
"
11,3,Cartman,"Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who!  It was Kenny, wasn't it?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hello, fren! Hello!
"
12,10,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
3,12,Kyle,"Are you insane?!
"
1,12,Cartman,"Yeah, and I've learned something, too. Robert Smith kicks ass!  Oh no! She's back!
"
2,6,Kyle,"Yeah. And we're sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.
"
12,9,Wendy,"You really think that's gonna work on me?!
"
5,7,Timmy,"Timmehah!
"
3,4,Stan,"Damn it!
"
5,5,Stan,"Phillip? That's not Phillip.
"
4,17,Stan,"Nobody's paying any attention. 
"
3,3,Stan,"Yeah, we gotta talk to Chef after school and get him to come back.
"
16,10,Kyle,"Wait a minute, Dad was the UPS man?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!
"
9,4,Stan,"Well, what does it say?
"
12,1,Cartman,"He was a basketball player.
"
10,1,Mr. Mackey,"So long!
"
3,13,Cartman,"Uh- chair. C H A R E  God damnit, how come I get the hard ones?!  Get over here, you son of a bitch Fonics Monkey!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Okay.
"
6,8,Stan,"What would the priest ...possibly want to put in our butts? 
"
10,9,Cartman,"They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again.
"
11,12,Stan,"Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!
"
11,12,Kyle,"Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!
"
5,13,Kyle,"Stan, you can't leave!
"
6,2,Kyle,"Go on, Ike.
"
2,5,Stan,"Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup! 
"
3,2,Randy,"Mr. Garrison, help me!
"
13,1,Butters,"Oh, no. Oh, geez!
"
6,4,Cartman,"No, it has to be Kyle. 
"
6,16,Cartman,"Ohhh. Wait. Stan becomes this douchebag?
"
16,3,Cartman,"Guys, remember when we heard about that pollack with one testicle in the revolutionary war? What was his name?
"
7,9,Kyle,"We d-didn't think it was that big a deal.
"
5,10,Butters,"I tried to make a good picture. Honest.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Dude, not now! 
"
18,9,Kyle,"Come on! 
"
9,11,Cartman,"Red Power! 
"
7,7,Stan,"Dad, what are you doing?! Don't take their dirty money!
"
8,8,Stan,"""Vote or Die""?  What the hell does that even mean?!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Beefcaake!
"
11,4,Stan,"Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!
"
2,12,Cartman,"Ahaw, that's weak.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Don't worry, you guys. He forgot about Kenny. Kenny will help us.
"
7,15,Cartman,"But if you don't mind, we're in a rush to see the new Prime Minister.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Egh. God damn it!  Well, I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your guinea pig.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Almost. You ready, Timmy?
"
5,9,Kyle,"Well what are we supposed to do with it?
"
17,10,Wendy,"Cheer Squad roll call! 
"
9,11,Cartman,"Red Power!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Don't forget, a third of that four million dollars is mine! 
"
5,8,Kenny,"(Aw, Goddamnit!)
"
17,7,Kyle,"Those XBox Ones are as good as ours!
"
18,8,Stan,"Wendy, did you hear about last night?
"
12,14,Butters,"Dahhh.  I know now what I have to do!  Myah!
"
6,5,Stan,"Well, screw it! We'll watch it in your house even if it is being fumigated!
"
16,5,Kyle,"Look Butters, why don't you just talk to your family about it? You said your Grandma's visiting this week. Why don't you try talking to her?
"
2,5,Cartman,"Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumbass European hippie piece of crap. 
"
11,9,Randy,"Oh God, here it comes!  Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot!  Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot 
"
17,1,Butters,"The government watches everything we do?
"
3,8,Randy,"...Yeah.
"
14,5,Randy,"Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says ""Fred's Fudge and Candies""... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again. 
"
7,10,Cartman,"Well, right, or we could always do that.
"
13,13,Cartman,"I can't do jack! I went to my first student council meeting; all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid Sadie Hawkins dance! Student council's retarded! 
"
9,3,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
6,3,Butters,"Yes ma'am. 
"
9,12,Kyle,"Dude, L. Ron Hubbard was a science-fiction writer. He lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times.
"
16,1,Randy,"Now it's time for us to take responsibility for ourselves.
"
18,6,Stan,"It's not your fault. It's something to do with my family. It's like a curse.
"
12,5,Kyle,"You're not an awesome teacher!
"
16,10,Kyle,"Please? I need you to come sit down for a second.  So... Here we all are. Mom, do you want to tell Dad something?  Mom?
"
5,6,Cartman,"God! She didn't take this long to die.
"
13,1,Kyle,"Hold tight, buddy. We're gonna find a cure for you. 
"
6,12,Kyle,"Cartman? Cartman?!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Heheh! Look at Kenny. He's so poor, huh you guys? His family's so poor they couldn't pay the three ninety nine for the gym outfit. 
"
1,4,Stan,"Come on, let's go home. I can still make it in time for the game.  We can work on making you not gay together.  Sparky?
"
18,1,Cartman,"Whoa, whoa! What?
"
1,9,Kyle,"There's no such thing as Mr. Hankey.
"
10,4,Kyle,"I'll do everything I can.
"
7,8,Stan,"Yeah. Wait, what?
"
1,9,Kyle,"I can sing the Mr. Hankey song...
"
4,8,Wendy,"No.  You go ahead.
"
6,6,Cartman,"I think Towelie is awesome.
"
3,6,Stan,"Uh, no! I hate that toy!
"
12,9,Wendy,"What? No!
"
6,12,Kyle,"Do you see anything?
"
18,2,Cartman,"Oooo, trippy...
"
5,10,Kyle,"Well, looks like everything turned out alright for them.
"
17,5,Butters,"Heheh, yeah. 
"
1,4,Kyle,"Wow! Cool!
"
4,13,Kyle,"Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!
"
1,1,Stan,"Wow, poor Kenny.
"
8,14,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?
"
17,1,Stan,"Wow.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Down like a clown, Charlie Br... Down like a clown, Charlie B-broooowww... Down like a clown, Charlie Browh... Bro-uh-own. Down like a clown, Charlie Br-Brown. 
"
1,2,Stan,"Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly.
"
1,6,Cartman,"Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?
"
13,3,Stan,"Uh, what?
"
9,11,Cartman,"Red Power!
"
2,7,Kenny,"(Hey, that freakin' bike-!) 
"
2,3,Cartman,"I got reports that the suspect is in this area!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Man, I can't believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Dude! How are we gonna move twenty three calves to your house?
"
5,10,Butters,"Um-me?? Huh but I didn't do nothin'.
"
16,4,Kyle,"Yes. It's because the Pharaoh won't give the Hebrews what we want! God is angry.
"
18,1,Cartman,"You broke Kickstarter!
"
9,12,Stan,"No, I found a self-help program that can cure me.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Now look, ah I could be wrong. I ...pray that I'm wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think.  Do you see anything?
"
1,1,Wendy,"And what is that?
"
6,13,Butters,"Playing Lord of the Rings.  Ugh, wegh, oh yeah.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Aw, come on, dude! All you've done for the last four days is mope around! You might as well hang out with those Goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time!
"
1,6,Kyle,"What are we gonna do?
"
8,5,Cartman,"AWESOM-O must rest! His CPU system overloading.
"
12,10,Randy,"Hey, I'm worried about him too, Sharon.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Oh, that's alright.)
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"I can't kill her Mr. Hat. You're gonna have to do it. 
"
1,2,Kyle,"Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's. 
"
14,6,Kyle,"Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!
"
4,1,Stan,"Nothing else is gonna work.  We have to face the fact that without Cartman we're gonna lose to a bunch o' girls.
"
6,16,Stan,"But we have to teach our parents a lesson, Butters! We're running away! Help me find the perfect place to run away to! 
"
6,5,Butters,"No! I really don't have a babysitter. That's why I'm stayin' at Stan's.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Hey Stan.  Oh Goddammit you told Kyle, didn't you?!
"
8,8,Stan,"It was ridiculous. We have to have a new school mascot and we're supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
"
6,14,Cartman,"No, it was Kenny!
"
10,10,Kyle,"Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom.
"
1,6,Randy,"Me.
"
8,9,Randy,"No, I'm just... really, really tired. I... was shopping at Wall-Mart all night.
"
15,14,Cartman,"You're my new mom?
"
18,5,Cartman,"That's stupid.
"
5,10,Butters,"But, buut, but but what hey! Wait a minute! 
"
16,14,Kyle,"Protect it?
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"Your sister?!  Oh for Pete's sake, don't be such a little wuss.  Stop wasting Mr. Hat's time with pansy little foo-foo problems, and, give me back my cocoa!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Yeah, let's watch Yo Gabba Gabba, like old times.
"
10,2,Cartman,"Ah, that's better. 
"
18,10,Kyle,"Why would he do this?!
"
1,7,Stan,"No buts, Wendy! I wish you were dead! 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?
"
4,12,Kyle,"Wouldn't it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?
"
16,3,Cartman,"Faith Hilling. Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
"
6,6,Kyle,"Token.  Clyde.  Craig  Timmy
"
12,1,Butters,"How ya doin', Eric? You know, I think you're a real special little guy, and even though you have AIDS, I ain't gonna act any different towards you. 
"
6,1,Butters,"But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.
"
5,9,Stan,"...That doesn't make sense. You guys are just buttholes!
"
14,9,Randy,"What does that mean?!
"
6,5,Kyle,"They didn't play the Terrance & Phillip trailer again!
"
5,10,Kyle,"...Okay Cartman, what do you want this time?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Dude, at least flush the toilet!  Aww, it's cute, it's little chocolate hearts.
"
14,9,Cartman,"You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!
"
5,12,Kyle,"I'll kick you in the nuts, Stan! 
"
15,12,Butters,"Ehe, and so then, Skeletor told Terminator he wanted a divorce, and apparently it's all gonna be finalized soon.
"
9,8,Stan,"Dude! Dude, did you see the news last night?
"
10,8,Cartman,"That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Fuck!
"
6,5,Butters,"Oh boy, we gotta hurry, guys!  ...Come on! 
"
7,4,Cartman,"Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
3,7,Cartman,"That was sooo cool! I wish we could've seen his face!
"
5,3,Kyle,"He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass.
"
18,6,Stan,"I don't know how you can say that when you're standing here chugging beer!
"
4,17,Kyle,"You wish-
"
12,3,Stan,"What the hell kind of flowers are those?
"
12,6,Kyle,"Ih it's not working.
"
15,7,Stan,"That sounds like shit!
"
7,11,Kyle,"Oh please! All you ever do is call me names and rip on me for being Jewish!
"
5,2,Cartman,"Awww!
"
9,5,Kyle,"Dude, what are we gonna do? We can't win this game.
"
11,14,Kyle,"Who said that?
"
10,4,Cartman,"Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow...
"
14,4,Stan,"Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?
"
2,5,Cartman,"I love you guys.  Ah, screw you guys(!)
"
6,4,Kyle,"He might be right, dude.
"
15,13,Stan,"It's cool dude, we understand.
"
3,10,Kenny,"(No! This is mine!)
"
6,4,Butters,"Really?
"
3,15,Cartman,"Sure. 
Here's a little dreidel that's small and made of clay.
But I'm not gonna play with it, 'cause dreidel's freakin' gay.
"
6,13,Stan,"No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Aaaargh!)
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Thank you.
"
10,8,Stan,"Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad! 
"
8,5,Butters,"There he is! AWESOM-O, this is my Aunt Nellie. 
"
7,14,Stan,"You guys have no idea how this feels. It's like, you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think it's just a figure of speech? But it's true. My chest hurts. I feel this like, sinking feeling where my heart is. It's broken...
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? 
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"No, I'm asking why Eric Cartman isn't at school.
"
16,1,Randy,"Oh, come on, don't give me a ticket!
"
10,8,Stan,"That's übercool.
"
11,4,Kyle,"Over a hundred.
"
12,6,Stan,"I'm getting on it first.
"
11,7,Cartman,"Cool.
"
13,13,Butters,"Ohhh, he's got her now!
"
18,2,Mr. Mackey,"Sorry I'm late. I had to stop and get my own breakfast because I figured y'all would be having doughnuts, but I'm actually gluten-free, so I can't have doughnuts, m'kay?
"
16,6,Kyle,"You fat piece of shit!
"
1,11,Wendy,"Stan? We're still Valentines, right?
"
4,11,Stan,"Dude, I an so disillusioned right now.
"
15,9,Kyle,"Look guys, all we need to do is split up and apply some good diversion tactics. We'll use the Texans' emotions against them.
"
7,9,Stan,"I don't wanna be in a stupid Christian rock band!
"
5,14,Butters,"...No.
"
5,10,Kyle,"I don't know. Let's go see. 
"
15,13,Kyle,"Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don't you come and help?!
"
13,7,Cartman,"What?!
"
15,11,Randy,"Okay, I'll be right back.  'Scuse me, sorry. 
"
6,5,Cartman,"Huh. Ohmigod! Huh.
"
13,13,Kyle,"Oh God, no! 
"
1,5,Kyle,"Shut up Terrance, we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want.
"
6,15,Stan,"Huh?
"
7,3,Stan,"What is it, Cartmam? 
"
14,2,Kenny,"(Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)
"
18,8,Cartman,"That was goddamned manly! I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular ""Magic: The Gathering"" look like girls volleyball.
"
12,13,Stan,"Yeah, look, I I know you think the kids in school like you, but, actually they're all getting really annoyed.
"
1,2,Wendy,"Oh my God.
"
4,12,Stan,"Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!
"
18,1,Stan,"Boy, this is the life, huh guys?
"
4,8,Cartman,"Oh, huh. Yeah. Yeah, totally huh.
"
7,10,Randy,"Get up the stairs! Up the stairs! Come on! Come on!! 
"
8,7,Kyle,"Aw, dude. 
"
9,5,Kyle,"Oh my God... their pitcher was able to hit him right on the bat.
"
6,2,Butters,"Goooood mornin', fellas! All set to go skiin'?!  A-huh, u-uh, uh what's so funny?
"
10,7,Cartman,"No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!
"
8,9,Stan,"You?
"
9,9,Cartman,"Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image!  Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.
"
4,17,Kyle,"-And I'll stand. 
"
9,8,Stan,"Dude, I don't think your uncle'd want us driving it.
"
16,5,Butters,"Oh uh, nothin'.
"
6,5,Kyle,"Just just leave it alone.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!
"
8,9,Kyle,"Dude, our town is going to be better without the-  What the?
"
5,6,Cartman,"Ogh! God-damnit..!
"
8,11,Stan,"No, Jimmy, the school is already dumb. We're just giving them what they want.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Are you okay, Salma Hayek?
"
4,8,Wendy,"You mean, I should kiss him? 
"
9,14,Cartman,"Yeah, let's go.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Go away!
"
2,9,Kenny,"(Yeah, that's because you vomit on her all the time.) 
"
12,11,Cartman,"That's right.
"
3,14,Stan,"That would suck so much ass.
"
14,14,Randy,"Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche.  Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Du-dude! You're doing it all wrong! Let me handle this.  Alright ya scalliwags! Surrender your plunder and let me send my shot across your bow!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow! Thanks, Eric.
"
2,17,Stan,"Yeah.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Sleep!
"
6,8,Kyle,"No! Because you'll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Bye bye Billy.  Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good.
"
7,9,Kyle,"No! Didn't you guys learn anything? Look, if we make an album, all that's gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the Internet. We won't make a dime!
"
13,11,Stan,"You're not?
"
4,11,Kyle,"Ask him what hell is like.
"
2,12,Randy,"Oh, brother. 
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yes, let's. 
"
17,9,Cartman,"Kyle thought of it.  Stan, dude, hold on! XBox One is fuckin' sweet, dude!  You're a fuckin' asshole!
"
8,3,Kenny,"(I don't know!)
"
18,3,Randy,"In my jeans?
"
8,2,Stan,"Yeah sure, we'll come cheer you and Timmy on.
"
7,14,Stan,"All right, so how do I join you?
"
15,8,Stan,"...K, coming. 
"
17,3,Cartman,"The outbreak's starting! Fly the plane now! 
"
18,9,Kyle,"Ike, we could go play the game downstairs. Isn't that better than watching some guy on YouTube playing it?
"
14,5,Randy,"Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you.
"
14,4,Wendy,"Am I a joke to you?
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Hmmm, I haven't heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m'kay?
"
8,13,Kyle,"All right, here we go.  Since the days of Copernicus, man has dreamed of flight. On this historic day we remem- aw, screw it! 
"
3,2,Mr. Garrison,"I, I do not know you, sir.
"
4,9,Randy,"The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.
"
7,5,Mr. Garrison,"Well what are we waiting for? Let's get outside! 
"
9,1,Kyle,"All right!  Ow. Hm. 
"
14,3,Cartman,"Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!
"
14,2,Cartman,"Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned.
"
15,2,Timmy,"Timmy Timmy Timmy!  Timmih! Timmih Timmih! Timmiiih!
"
9,5,Randy,"Wha-what do you mean?
"
8,8,Jimmy,"That's a... fantastic idea fellas. Uh, the key to successful humor is s-staying power. Uh, tell me the first mascot idea.
"
1,6,Stan,"No grampa, I'll get in trouble.
"
15,13,Stan,"Aw, I think he's just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing.
"
5,9,Cartman,"That dollar buys me a chocolate milk for lunch! What, do you want me to just get a regular milk for ten cents?  Now look, it isn't our fault that terrorists hate us. We're just kids. We're not the ones bombing them now, we're- we're just kids.  There's a lot of crazy stuff goin' on in the world, but, we're caught in the middle. It's not our fault.
"
16,3,Cartman,"I can hear Kyle, just tell me when to go.
"
5,4,Cartman,"A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here
"
9,5,Randy,"Whattaya wanna do, huh? Whattaya wanna do?
"
8,11,Cartman,"God, I wish we had a Pizza Hut in South Park.
"
4,16,Cartman,"Eheh, I'm afraid you'll find all the phones... quite out of service.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Oho kick fucking ass, dude! 
"
1,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey.
"
11,1,Randy,"Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you! 
"
1,7,Kyle,"Check.
"
12,13,Wendy,"Stan, that's ridiculous.
"
6,5,Cartman,"There, you got it, you got it!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Hyaaaa! 
"
2,7,Stan,"Oh my God, it's killing Kenny!
"
4,9,Randy,"No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it.
"
13,14,Stan,"I don't know. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Somebody had to intervene, Kyle! You were standing in the way of Token and Nichole! They belong together!
"
2,7,Stan,"He can't hold it in forever.
"
16,7,Kyle,"Oh, thanks.  Dude, that new girl's into me!
"
6,5,Butters,"How far away is June?
"
12,7,Butters,"Been a hoot all right!
"
10,8,Cartman,"Stan, what the hell are you doing?! 
"
7,11,Butters,"""Dried food rations. Add water to feed flavored square...""  Hello?  Hello??
"
14,6,Stan,"Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!
"
12,9,Cartman,"I ate my underwear!  What the hell do you want from me?!  Weh-
"
4,17,Cartman,"Heheh. Look, he made Stan all fat.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow, what a what a great audience. So apparently Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you have you heard about this, have you seen this? She's very excited to get started on her new show, ""Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic ankle bracelet.""  So it looks like the Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope. Have you seen this, have you heard about this?  A-a-apparently they're going to call him New Pope, a-and refer to John Paul as P-Pope Classic.  Uh,.. so it so it looks like Michael Jackson is having back problem in court.  You know... huh... you uh you know what they say about b-b-b-b-back problems.  Uh, uh gee, what a terrific audience.  What a fantastic audience.
"
13,12,Stan,"Gay people?
"
2,12,Cartman,"That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!  What?
"
6,3,Butters,"Uh, sure.
"
13,6,Stan,"What does it want?
"
11,7,Kyle,"Holy shit, dude! 
"
3,12,Stan,"Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.
"
9,14,Stan,"All right!
"
14,4,Stan,"I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"But you work for the-  uh, God-damnit!!
"
3,6,Stan,"Have you seen any panda bears?
"
3,3,Kyle,"He's a big guy, with a beard.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Es ist Zeit für Rache! 
"
11,13,Stan,"Dude, this is awesome.
"
2,11,Stan,"Yeah. What's a discharge?
"
2,4,Cartman,"What the hell is that supposed to be?
"
4,1,Kyle,"Well, we got some cigarettes, but we don't think you should be smoking. Each year, over a million people die of smo-
"
13,14,Cartman,"Because it's important! A fifty percent rise each year means that in three years the world will be only... minorities. That's 2012! The Mayans predicted this!
"
6,6,Cartman,"Very nice. 
"
11,5,Randy,"You know so little! 
"
6,11,Stan,"Dude, this is worse than Child Tracker.
"
11,1,Butters,"All right, Eric, come on, Eric.
"
4,9,Kyle,"Dude, what's wrong with your leg?
"
7,9,Cartman,"Oh Lord you are my Savior! You know I miss you so much when you are gone.
"
9,8,Cartman,"We're not moving.
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"What?! How dare you say that?!
"
3,6,Stan,"'Scuse me. We'd like to speak with Sexual Harassment Panda, please.
"
10,10,Kyle,"I'm dead to you?
"
12,7,Wendy,"They must be negotiating.
"
15,8,Wendy,"Hey Kyle?  Have you heard anything at all from Stan?
"
9,14,Randy,"Uh, kay, here we go. 
"
17,6,Kyle,"I'm not a dick, I'm like Gandhi!
"
10,1,Randy,"Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?
"
2,9,Cartman,"Whoa!
"
9,14,Randy,"The guy behind him is blind! There he goes! C'mon! C'mon! Go go go! 
"
10,7,Cartman,"I'm not fat!
"
1,11,Wendy,"It's over. I give up. 
"
8,10,Butters,"Tru... Tr-Trent Boyett! Haaaa!  Dad! Mom! I'm don- I'm done playin' now!  Aaaaah! Let me in, Dad!  Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door! 
"
12,2,Butters,"It ain't right to take advantage of somebody no matter who they are! 
"
12,5,Cartman,"Who wants to argue on a nice day like theees? How about a little pickup game?  Hey paisanoo, can you keep score for us? 
"
9,7,Cartman,"Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, apparently you wrote that Wendy's private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through, m'kay?
"
2,13,Cartman,"I'd like to see you do better!
"
2,12,Stan,"Wow!
"
16,7,Kyle,"Sooo, theoretically, if someone was to step in, it would beee, okayyy?
"
2,8,Cartman,"Stan?
"
10,6,Stan,"Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.
"
3,14,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
5,10,Butters,"My mom?  Oh, sweet Jesus!
"
2,2,Kenny,"(I'll stick 'em together)
"
5,10,Cartman,"Dude, dude! Check it out! This is the sweetest thing I've ever done!
"
7,4,Mr. Garrison,"Well that's just jingles! Because I'm assigning all you little flag-burners a full report on seventeen seventy-siyix, and the Founding Fathers!
"
1,13,Cartman,"What?! Who the hell did that to my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance?!
"
7,3,Cartman,"They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.
"
1,2,Cartman,"I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!
"
3,16,Cartman,"Wow, Stan, you really got some nice titties there.
"
5,3,Kyle,"Great!
"
10,4,Cartman,"Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out.  Time in!  I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"That's a pretty weird bone disease.
"
6,10,Cartman,"...No, our teacher's dead. Remember?
"
18,7,Butters,"Hahaha, I'm in the bad part of town! I just hit a lamp post! Ah, ah-I'm back on my feet. Oh, oh that's cool. There's a prostitute out here.
"
2,13,Stan,"Really?
"
18,2,Randy,"Wuh sure! 
"
5,8,Stan,"'Scuse me, can we have our Okama GameSphere back? We just wanna play video games.
"
10,6,Stan,"Hello?
"
12,7,Cartman,"Fine, then you're comin' with me!
"
13,2,Cartman,"It's not a cool costume! He just wears his underwear over his buttfucking pants! Now, come on, which one of you guys is it?!
"
12,4,Kyle,"Sir, we're doing everything we can.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"The... B-Bloods?
"
11,2,Butters,"Well sure, I guess.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Ooooooo, somebody's a sore loser! Clyde, I believe I said, ""get the fudge out!"" Which means, kiss mah fudgin' ass, go fudge yourself, fudge ya, get the fudge out, Clyde!
"
9,8,Kyle,"George Bush?
"
6,6,Cartman,"Yeah. Do we really need another one?
"
1,9,Mr. Mackey,"Mad enough to kill, Kyle??? 
"
5,8,Stan,"Do you have our Okama GameSphere?
"
1,2,Cartman,"Hey!
"
4,2,Butters,"Oh. Heh, I got a loose tooth right here. 
"
13,14,Cartman,"Guys? Guys!  Oh it's true! You all did survive!
"
10,14,Stan,"What?? 
"
10,6,Kyle,"Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??
"
1,11,Cartman,"Oh, hi, Chef.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Jennifer Lopez?
"
6,8,Kyle,"I don't need to. It wouldn't work.
"
5,8,Stan,"Hello? Hello, anybody here? 
"
6,5,Stan,"Well, only one of us has to go to the store. The others can watch.
"
5,4,Kyle,"What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! 
"
8,8,Stan,"Ahh, no thanks, that's okay.
"
2,12,Stan,"And I say, ""Dare!""
"
7,9,Kyle,"I think out band better buy a whole bunch of music CDs to listen to for inspiration.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oh, yehes. Uh-heh. He has ah, blond hair, aha-and, ah, and a brown eye.  Brown eye! 
"
11,6,Cartman,"That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
"
8,1,Stan,"Uh, we'd love to hang out guys, but we have important secret work to do. 
"
12,1,Kyle,"He purposely infected me with his HIV virus!
"
1,1,Kyle,"...and now I have to go home without him and my parents are going to have me killed.
"
16,2,Cartman,"Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!
"
11,14,Wendy,"Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one.
"
2,17,Stan,"Uh... Hooray.
"
18,2,Stan,"For someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on!
"
8,8,Jimmy,"Heh, huh okay, that's pretty funny. Now, what's the second?
"
8,10,Cartman,"Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.
"
15,10,Kyle,"I'm not looking at that!
"
6,13,Kyle,"Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. 
"
16,5,Butters,"...Yeah. 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Oh my God, this can't be happening!  Mom? Mom's crying? Oh God, it is true!  Oh, it's not fair!  Why??? Why??? 
"
9,6,Butters,"He says, he love you. 
"
15,12,Cartman,"What do you mean, Peter Panda?
"
3,8,Randy,"Yeah! Yeah, it's true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can't deal with your accusing stares!  We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I'm not proud of it, but there it is!
"
1,6,Stan,"Let me out grampa!  I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time. 
"
14,2,Stan,"What? Hey! 
"
13,10,Jimmy,"So is that when I t- tell you that your girlfriend is a whore?
"
1,8,Stan,"I think he said his name is Marvin.
"
13,9,Butters,"I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud.
"
16,2,Stan,"Yes, Grandpa.
"
5,1,Kyle,"Haven't you noticed everyone getting sick? It all started when they said ""shit"" on television.
"
14,8,Butters,"There you go. You're back on the track.
"
4,11,Timmy,"Timmiiiy!
"
10,11,Cartman,"See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face. 
"
6,5,Butters,"I never gave Shelly her tampons. She's been this whole time without them. 
"
6,12,Cartman,"Shut up!
"
9,14,Stan,"No! You don't need another beer!
"
8,3,Cartman,"How do you know?! I've seen The Passion thirty-four times now, Kyle! You haven't seen it once! There's even one part where the Jews have a chance to save Jesus, and you know what they do? They let Barabbas, a serial killer, go free instead and laugh about it.
"
3,8,Stan,"Hey you guys! We've got a big problem!  The ATF is outside and they think you're all a religious cult. You've gotta go talk to them. 
"
8,11,Stan,"Apparently it doesn't matter how hard you work.
"
1,11,Wendy,"Thanks for coming over, Bebe.
"
15,12,Cartman,"There's one problem.  You say I have to grow up, to get rid of all my dolls. You forget one crucial thing, Polly Prissypants. That nobody would possibly blame Token for all this because in today's day and age you can't blame a black person for anything.
"
8,2,Cartman,"Enter. 
"
9,3,Cartman,"Four thousand dollars? 
"
16,13,Stan,"Thanks a lot.  Jesus, did you take HGH to do your miracles?
"
11,7,Cartman,"All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes.
"
4,7,Butters,"Ho, I don't wanna!
"
17,2,Kyle,"Alright, alright, let's calm down! I know we're all concerned here!
"
11,4,Kyle,"Good thinking
"
14,2,Kyle,"Ah... Oh Butters,  it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning.
"
1,13,Kyle,"Did you send the videotape to America's Stupidest Home Videos?
"
6,8,Randy,"With everything that's been in the news, I think it's best to keep our kids... far away from the priests.
"
17,1,Butters,"Hello. How would you like to know the Truth?
"
8,6,Cartman,"Oh, you know what?! This makes perfect sense! A guy moves into South Park with a FERRIS wheel in his back yard, and KYLE has to see a problem with it!  Mr. Jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time, and if you miss this up, so help me god, I will rip your balls off with my bare hands! With my bare hands, Goddamn you! 
"
10,14,Randy,"Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle.
"
3,17,Stan,"Okay, let's get back to the room. 
"
16,8,Butters,"Wuh wuuuhhh wuh!  Wha? Wha? Oh.  Ohhh... Daaad! It happened again.  More of my creamy goo came out. 
"
12,4,Cartman,"Wait. I've got it.
"
1,13,Cartman,"More tea, Rumpertumskin?
"
12,3,Kyle,"I can't. My dad grounded me. Wait a minute, where is my dad?
"
16,8,Stan,"We're not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says ""Competitiveness can be compassionate,"" he's being completely sincere?
"
16,12,Butters,"Oh hey Eric and Kenny. You guys don't have costumes?
"
14,2,Kyle,"Butters wrote a second book!
"
14,7,Butters,"You're not the towel you used to be.  Where, as you used to be fluffy and absorbent, ye-you now are crusty and.... and unable to absorb the smallest amount of water. Will you get help today?
"
16,8,Randy,"...Yeah... 
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Uh thanks so much for letting me come over, Ms. Choksondik.
"
2,10,Stan,"Dude, you've got herpes on your face!
"
4,2,Kyle,"What if this is all just somebody's dream?
"
3,3,Stan,"...Yeah, screw that bitch.
"
8,11,Stan,"They're doing it in the hallways!  Behind the school! 
"
4,8,Wendy,"I know.
"
13,10,Stan,"Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!
"
17,10,Stan,"Hey, Wendy uh, can I ask you a big favor?
"
16,1,Cartman,"Hey, how about you people speed it up in here? I'm about to crap my pants and I demand access to the toilet right now!
"
14,2,Stan,"Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!
"
1,2,Cartman,"Hey dudes.
"
18,1,Cartman,"We don't stand for anything. Remember our company plan, guys!  Start up, cash in, sell out, bro down.
"
4,17,Stan,"What, dude?
"
8,2,Jimmy,"You too, Francis. 
"
9,10,Cartman,"Yes teacher.
"
4,17,Stan,"How come everyone in cartoons has such big heads?
"
15,13,Kyle,"We're not basing research for our report on this crap!
"
14,11,Randy,"What the hell is that?  Who put that there?
"
8,9,Stan,"Dude, come on!
"
5,14,Butters,"Well, sure, that makes sense, I suppose, yeah. Hey, did you seen my mittens anywhere?  It's cold out here.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Argh! 
"
14,3,Randy,"One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!
"
17,1,Cartman,"Yes, I'm here to apply for the NSA job?
"
17,9,Randy,"Stan! You're alive! I saved you!  It's okay, Beyoncé! The fight's over! You can still shop! 
"
3,14,Randy,"Alright men, fire! 
"
4,11,Cartman,"Let us get back to our work at the church.  Yea. I shall answer the phone, hyah.  Hello?
"
7,14,Cartman,"Come on, Stan, it's first down still. 
"
2,11,Cartman,"Psych!
"
5,7,Stan,"I was doing ""red rocket"" to make the dog's milk come out.
"
16,14,Butters,"Red Lobster!
"
4,2,Timmy,"Timmih-
"
4,1,Stan,"Come on, let's get it a try. 
"
9,9,Cartman,"You aren't there to have fun, you black asshole! You were supposed to be getting the future-telling device.
"
3,2,Kenny,"(Ach) 
"
6,8,Randy,"No it doesn't.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Uuuh, Chef, you haven't seen Butters around, have you?
"
3,14,Cartman,"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-  -AAAH!
"
9,12,Stan,"Okay, I'll try. I just wish I could write in my room, but Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
"
13,4,Butters,"Well it's on, it's on, itsonitsonitson!
"
3,1,Kyle,"Whoa, dude!
"
2,14,Kyle,"Chef Aid?
"
18,8,Cartman,"We're going again on Friday, right?
"
13,8,Stan,"It's gonna be alright, Kyle.
"
2,18,Kyle,"It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see?  Everybody looks like you do.  Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you. 
"
6,5,Cartman,"Kyle. What's your name? 
"
1,6,Stan,"Cool!
"
16,2,Stan,"Fifteen bucks?!
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"Well up yours, rednecks!
"
15,7,Kyle,"Look, Stam, we-we just wanted to be able to go to the movies and enjoy ourselves, you know? I'm sorry but... you're a bummer to be around. Everything is ""that looks like shit"" and, and ""this is shitty!""
"
3,14,Cartman,"NOOO!!
"
10,2,Stan,"What?
"
12,1,Butters,"Poor Kyle. He's really taking it hard.
"
16,12,Randy,"You were thinking it. But you're wrong. The average person still wants to rent movies they can hold in their hands. We're gonna have customers up our ass Sharon, UP OUR ASS.
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"It's called The Catcher In The Rye, and it has some very... risqué parts... 
"
2,7,Cartman,"What?! Eeyy, you son of a bitch! I'll kick you in the nuts! 
"
4,7,Timmy,"Timmiihh.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!
"
6,11,Cartman,"Tawya mea pleda cleah bleah.
"
4,15,Kenny,"(Sure!)
"
12,3,Kyle,"You guys are wasting your time.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Hey, that's it. Oh, my God, that's totally it!  It's so simple!
"
4,8,Kyle,"Pretty good, I guess.
"
9,2,Cartman,"You just SOLD OUT OUR TOWN! 
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"What do you mean?
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"How am I supposed to do a play, okay, teaching students about the importance of dental hygiene without Tooth Decay?! We have two more days of tape, and then previews start on Monday! What am I supposed to do, Kyle?! You tell me!
"
4,11,Butters,"Huh-Hallelujah!
"
3,6,Cartman,"Oh my God! You guys have to do something!
"
3,5,Kenny,"(Here you go.)  (No way!) 
"
17,3,Cartman,"Don't worry, nobody can see us wearing black.
"
14,4,Cartman,"Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle!  Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there.
"
4,16,Cartman,"Okay, see, I am the mayor of Smiley Town, and so I will ask the questions around hyah!
"
3,7,Cartman,"If you want, I could help you.
"
5,6,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)  (Heeheehee!!) 
"
17,1,Butters,"It's time to let go, Eric. Don't you see there's no other way? Just let the government into your heart.
"
1,5,Cartman,"God Damnit, would you shut the hell up?!  Nobody gives a rat's ass.
"
9,14,Randy,"Hey, see you Nelson.
"
17,8,Kyle,"All these people are going to be gaming on XBox. You really wanna just game with Craig the rest of your life?
"
10,2,Cartman,"Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?
"
7,11,Kyle,"And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can't go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Don't worry about it.
"
3,10,Stan,"Kore wa watashi no uchi desu. 
"
13,13,Wendy,"Luckily with the money I made selling the movie rights to my book, I'll be okay.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Uh-ho-ho, man, that's hella funny! 
"
4,1,Stan,"Come on! We've gotta catch up to them! 
"
9,11,Kenny,"(Hehe, yeah. Hehe)
"
18,8,Cartman,"Thank you so very much.
"
14,14,Randy,"How's it goin'? 
"
15,9,Cartman,"Nobody's fuckin' screaming, Craig! Wake the fuck up! 
"
13,13,Butters,"That you hate Smurfs?
"
1,5,Stan,"Wait, wait.  We still need a pig.
"
1,11,Wendy,"No. I just have to apologize for the way I've been acting.
"
4,14,Timmy,"T-tim-mih.
"
10,10,Cartman,"You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. 
"
8,7,Stan,"No, it's not a chicken sandwich!  I want a Goddamned cheeseburger and some Goddamned fries you fucking goobacks!
"
11,1,Randy,"Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how hard I try, people just say ""Hey! There goes that 'nigger' guy.""  Everywhere I go, it's always the same. I can't get away from that terrible name! ""Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy!"" Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. Someone just beat you to it. But my dream will not die: To be thought of as more... than just ""Nigger Guy"".  Respect. 
"
15,11,Stan,"Come on, Feegan, either jump or get off! 
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Wow, what a great audience... How about this classic? Knock-knock.
"
2,11,Stan,"This is stupid.
"
13,1,Kyle,"Yeah, this all happened the day after he went to that concert!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Kick the baby. 
"
15,4,Randy,"Yeeaahh!
"
6,13,Stan,"We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
"
3,10,Stan,"Totally gay.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Bitch?! Don't call me bitch! I'll pop your fuckin' head open!
"
3,13,Kenny,"(Heheh, yeah. You're a faggot, dude. Fuck, yeah. Hehe-eheh.)
"
15,4,Randy,"Vou DAMN N MONTAIRE 
"
10,4,Cartman,"...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism.
"
2,10,Cartman,"In the ghetto
On a cold and gray Chicago morn 
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto... In the ghetto
"
11,5,Stan,"Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
"
13,10,Jimmy,"Lies! These are all a bunch of lies!  Now you listen here, El, Pollo Loco! It doesn't matter if your wife was killed, you cannot keep Irene's aborted baby!
"
17,1,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
18,9,Cartman,"Uh oh, it looks like Kyle is taking issue with something again. Kyle's got a pro-blem. CartmanBrah!
"
15,10,Mr. Garrison,"Well okay.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Take that, Jimmy!  And that! And don't you ever talk bad about Kyle again!  Kyle is my friend! And if you say you had sex with his mom one more time, I'm gonna really let you have it! You hear me?!  Oh, Kyle. Hey.
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha) 
"
16,6,Kyle,"We've definitely not done that before!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Hey,  that house looks perfect. There's obviously kids living there. 
"
6,7,Butters,"Wokay, how about this, Dougie?  I-I'm going' to pose as a real-estate agent and con everyone in town into buyin' a monorail. And then skip town with all their money.  No?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Oh, uh, wawawhat is this?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Excuse me, sir.  we're looking for a group of people called the Crips.
"
10,10,Kyle,"Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. 
"
7,14,Jimmy,"Should I try telling him a fa-fantastic joke?
"
16,8,Stan,"I'm sorry. My dad is taking professional sarcastaball really seriously.
"
10,2,Stan,"Yeah? 
"
2,5,Stan,"Aw, do we have to?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"No, we never have. Are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like Christopher Reeve?
"
18,2,Kenny,"(Right. What the fuck is going on?)
"
6,7,Stan,"Yeah, and they've been on the air for like, thirteen years. Of course they've done everything.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Who are you?
"
13,12,Kyle,"I don't either.
"
6,11,Randy,"If anybody takes you, we'll be able to locate your exact location within two meters.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Neat, huh Kenny?
"
2,16,Cartman,"Amen. 
"
10,6,Stan,"How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere.
"
5,1,Stan,"Dude, we need help from the British!
"
1,4,Kyle,"Chef!
"
6,9,Kyle,"This looks like the right room.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Hold on, I'm checking for robot guards.  Wewewewewewe...
"
14,8,Butters,"Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid.
"
13,2,Kyle,"...Yeah, and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway.
"
9,12,Stan,"Tom Cruise locked himself in my closet and he won't come out. 
"
14,2,Stan,"Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!
"
10,6,Butters,"Bill Clinton.
"
6,2,Randy,"Oh, Jesus.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, can I go with the guys to see the Raging Pussies?
"
8,2,Timmy,"Haaaaaaaaaah!
"
2,16,Stan,"Oh, hey Kenny.
"
18,9,Randy,"Sorry folks, just one second here.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Aw, man.  I don't feel so good.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race! And we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife, dark-skinned rats that they are! 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Oh... Hi, Officer B b-b-buh b-b-buh b-Barbrady.
"
9,3,Kenny,"(Wing?) 
"
14,11,Cartman,"I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you.
"
16,14,Stan,"Is that an M&M?
"
2,17,Kyle,"Show us.
"
15,11,Randy,"Shelly! 
"
3,10,Stan,"Yeah, get with the times, dude. 
"
2,5,Stan,"No, Cartman. Nobody ever has.
"
18,2,Stan,"Hey Wendy.
"
18,2,Stan,"Yeah, and we just- you know, we, we just can't turn our back on him.
"
10,4,Cartman,"Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well.
"
8,3,Kyle,"I'm a Vulcan!
"
11,1,Kyle,"Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?
"
3,4,Stan,"Yeah. He was standing there waiting for you, and he was all like, ""Man, Tweek's a wuss,"" and we were all like, ""No he's not, Craig,"" and he was all like, ""Yeah he is, he isn't showing up. He's a big wuss, and he has crooked teeth!""
"
12,9,Wendy,"What?!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Oh wow, where are we now, brahs?  This looks pretty stupid.
"
4,16,Stan,"And so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear. , by using the magic M word. 
"
3,17,Cartman,"Hm, interesting. Let's see: how about this? 
"
7,10,Cartman,"Aw yeah!
"
3,11,Stan,"Yeah, that's better.
"
2,14,Cartman,"Ready. I will do the German dance for youIt's fun and gay and tra-la-laI hope my will enjoy my danceFiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ayWould you like some sauerkraut, German boy, German boy?Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut--
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Because it was having sex with the chihi... Because it was having sex with the ch-hi-hi... Because it was having sex with the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch...  eh, it was having sex with the ch-ch-hiicken. 
"
7,13,Kyle,"D'awww sick! 
"
18,10,Kyle,"That son of a bitch!
"
3,7,Mr. Mackey,"Mhm, mkay? 
"
1,7,Kyle,"Cartman! What kind of costume is that?
"
11,5,Kyle,"Don't you have any superpowers?
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
1,7,Cartman,"Whoa, Chef's really scared of ghosts, huh?
"
13,11,Cartman,"Ahall right dude, this is pretty sweet! .
"
7,5,Kyle,"Come in.  COME IN!! 
"
4,10,Cartman,"Huh?
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Oh, that's great!)
"
1,1,Stan,"I don't know what the hell that is...
"
16,6,Cartman,"NOOOO!
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions...
"
18,8,Randy,"Oh? Not impressed? How about this? 
"
3,13,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman?
"
1,4,Kyle,"You what?!
"
10,2,Randy,"What's this? 
"
4,3,Cartman,"But as soon as he starts singing better, we're all gonna make bank!
"
16,3,Cartman,"SHUT UP, KITTY!
"
4,16,Cartman,"Notice anything?  Watch. 
"
7,10,Mr. Garrison,"Stay in your seats, children. I'll be right back.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Dude, you sneezed on my back!
"
7,8,Randy,"Well, you know what I think? I think you're all metrophobic!
"
3,2,Cartman,"Dude, you spend way too much time with that girl. If you don't-
"
5,3,Cartman,"He's going to eat his own head.
"
7,2,Cartman,"We didn't go to your comedy show.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, hi, boys, how are you today?
"
2,10,Kyle,"They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway.
"
15,5,Stan,"Doing what?
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle, you can't kill yourself!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Hey Kyle.
"
4,1,Cartman,"I hate hippies! I mean, the way they always talk about ""protectin' the earth"" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - I hate 'em! I wanna kick 'em in the nuts!
"
16,6,Stan,"The hardest part about it is knowing you can't take it back.  I mean, it was the fifth-generation Nano, so I can't trade it in anywhere.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Look out, everyone. There's some killer titties on the loose.  Could've swore I heard them coming through the roof.  ""Pssht! Officer! We need to get an APB out on those titties! They're armed and dangerous!"" 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Please, I can't do this alone. They need us. And I need you. My little flicker of twinkle stars. 
"
11,11,Stan,"Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid.
"
7,1,Kenny,"(Derrr!)
"
13,10,Cartman,"Dude! That was so badass!
"
4,6,Cartman,"Oh. Well, sure. I have some friends who want to be mature,  excluding Stan and Kyle, of course.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Hello, children. How is your summer going?
"
14,6,Cartman,"Then start explaining it to me!
"
4,8,Cartman,"That's how you win these things: attack your opponents' credibility!  Butters! Take some kids and go dig up whatever dirt you can on Kyle's past. I'm talkin' booby magazines, whatever.
"
13,14,Stan,"...Well, it's not like you suddenly have to pee, you're gonna get out of the shower.
"
7,5,Cartman,"What? Oh- AWWW!  Ben Affleck's spooge!!
"
8,1,Kyle,"That doesn't count, fatass!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Doodoo doot doo, dadadadada daa, ya da dadaa
Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,
heydy heydy heydy,
how's it goin', guys?
"
10,4,Cartman,"So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?
"
1,4,Stan,"Fine, how are you?
"
4,13,Kyle,"Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
"
17,10,Jimmy,"Hey Stan, did you see Clyde's going out with Lisa B-b-Berger?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Yeah, if these talent agents wanna play rough, we can play rough too! 
"
9,3,Stan,"Yeah. We're too smart to be talented.
"
14,8,Butters,"But you said to take your money so I took it by  Ah I don't know.
"
18,2,Cartman,"Oh my God, we've got Lorde to play live.
"
8,10,Stan,"Wow, cool!
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Um. How's he doing, nurse?
"
9,8,Stan,"Nothing. Can you just come get us, please?
"
2,7,Stan,"Dude, I think it's Saturday now.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"But I don't think I really have a problem.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Vi, Visitors, this morning you took my little brother, Ike. He's the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I've learned something today. That having a little brother... is a pretty special thing.
"
16,12,Stan,"It's all right. Let's go straight. Now turn left. Okay, now go about ten steps.
"
16,13,Stan,"My friends told me I was crazy,  that I was wasting my time.  But my cause is to stand my ground.  When others sat, I kept my bracelet on, because I stand...  for standing.
"
13,3,Randy,"Stan, now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money.
"
7,8,Kyle,"What? Y-you want me to hang out with you?
"
12,8,Kyle,"We live. That's what Indy would have wanted. We just try... to live.
"
16,1,Randy,"What good is the TSA if they aren't protecting us? Why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet?
"
9,11,Kyle,"This is all a bunch of crap!
"
8,14,Stan,"Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home. 
"
14,2,Cartman,"That's right.
"
11,3,Cartman,"This is a scientific test, designed to-
"
2,7,Wendy,"Mmmm.
"
2,18,Kyle,"I think so. Is Cartman up there?
"
9,12,Stan,"No, I don't wanna spend any money, you guys.  Let's just do something fun that's free.
"
3,11,Cartman,"Oh, dude, this is not cool!
"
5,2,Randy,"Wow, you sure whipped those kids into shape.
"
8,10,Stan,"I'm talking about hiring somebody bigger than Trent to protect us from him. Come on! 
"
6,16,Stan,"What the hell are you doing here?!
"
11,4,Kyle,"What's going on?
"
4,10,Kyle,"I am not!
"
16,2,Cartman,"We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Butters! Get your drum set and meet me at my house! We have to make a platinum album! Hurry, Butters! 
"
14,10,Stan,"Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that.
"
9,12,Stan,"...well but... but that's my money.
"
2,11,Cartman,"But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!
"
1,4,Stan,"Wow, seems like the animals here are really happy.
"
6,16,Stan,"Who's that?
"
10,1,Kyle,"And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. 
"
15,13,Kyle,"Dude!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Oh, so now everybody wants to meet Mr. Hankey! He's a piece of crap.
"
15,11,Randy,"AWWWWWWW! Why didn't you tell me Shelly was gonna see ""Wicked""?!
"
15,7,Randy,"No, it's just... young and hip so you don't get it, Sharon.
"
16,9,Cartman,"What, Kyle?! 
"
15,10,Kyle,"The blond kid?
"
9,10,Stan,"What?
"
7,13,Mr. Mackey,"Wait a minute, what?
"
3,16,Stan,"Yeah, Cartman told us.
"
16,1,Cartman,"That's right.
"
8,1,Kyle,"That is the dumbest idea you guys have ever come up with! I'd expect this stupidity out of Cartman, but you, Stan?! Butters needs medical attention right now!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Oh my God, that is what I've always said.  I love this guy!
"
2,18,Stan,"Where shall we bring it?
"
1,4,Cartman,"Stupid puppet. 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Alright, alright, stay back. Stay back! It definitely looks like a Jewpacabra attack, but it's hard to tell.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"And if I had just one wish, just one wish in the whole world,
If I had one wish it'd be for Cuba to change.
Because I think that all the Cubans are in pain
All the joy in the world, from sea to shining sea
Doesn't mean a thing if Cubans aren't free
I just can't be very happy, that's certain
Not as long as your Cubans are hurtin' 
Oh, won't you search your soul and find a way to change your mind?
That is my one and only wish.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Töten sie die Juden. Wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind! Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready to do thy bidding, Mel Gibson. 
"
11,10,Kyle,"I'm not doing it, fatass!
"
3,6,Kyle,"Tomorrow's trial, Everyone vs. Everyone, is gonna make things a lot worse! We have to stop it!
"
2,3,Kyle,"Who are you?
"
7,14,Butters,"So that's it? We're broken up now?
"
7,15,Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit! Well I warned you Kyle! I told you if I missed Christmas we were gonna throw down!  Well it's on! We're gonna have it our RIGHT NOW! 
"
3,11,Kyle,"Relax, fatass.
"
14,2,Kyle,"A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
"
11,14,Wendy,"I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-
"
7,6,Stan,"Detective Marsh. I'm in charge of this investigation!
"
3,8,Stan,"Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.
"
14,4,Stan,"...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-
"
3,10,Stan,"Nan da kore? 
"
1,7,Wendy,"Relax Stan. You'll feel better once we're out trick-or-treating.
"
9,9,Butters,"How do you know?
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
1,8,Kyle,"I can't wait to get out of school and get our Teiko sports watch.
"
6,16,Randy,"Oh. You. You don't?
"
9,13,Kyle,"All right. Thanks for your help, dudes.  Well, we did it, guys. It wasn't easy, but... we did a really amazing thing.
"
17,8,Butters,"NO! Black Friday is about to happen, and my friends and I have to be the first ones inside the mall to get XBoxes!
"
11,14,Cartman,"Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! 
"
2,6,Kyle,"Just do it again, Cartman, and don't make it talk! 
"
1,3,Cartman,"You piece of crap, I'll kill you! 
"
5,5,Kyle,"Well we got tickets to see Terrance and Phillip Live in Denver tomorrow night. We paid forty bucks apiece for them.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Dude, come on.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Wha'? Dude, do you think this is funny?!
"
16,2,Cartman,"...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck.
"
12,13,Cartman,"No way dude.
"
15,8,Stan,"No, Mom, sometimes you've got- a left turn.
"
2,13,Stan,"Yeah. And we have $5000 this time.
"
16,5,Stan,"Dude, Butters! We have awesome news! A Hollywood movie company is gonna buy our bullying video!
"
8,6,Kyle,"Shh, Blanket, we're gonna take you away for a little while, okay? 
"
16,3,Cartman,"Taylor Swift is dangerous. Taylor Swift is dangerous!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Eh, so, you don't want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you, then?  Look, ah, I don't know what your parents did to you, but if you're here, I take it they pissed you off pretty good. Maybe you should at least ...hear what I have to offer?
"
13,1,Jimmy,"Well, so, w-who is she?
"
16,11,Cartman,"It was crazy! Scott was just talking about how he needed to take his insulin shot, and out of nowhere Butters said he's sick of people with diabetes feeling sorry for themselves. Scott told Butters to shut up and Butters just started whaling on him!
"
3,3,Stan,"I don't know-uh. No reason I guess.
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
4,2,Kyle,"He's fat and he's stupid?
"
13,7,Kyle,"Wow, you know, Cartman? That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.
"
13,14,Stan,"Kyle, quick! You've gotta swim over to us!
"
13,11,Stan,"Oh, right. Look, I... I thnk I can make everything okay here. Can I just use a phone?
"
1,3,Kenny,"(Nope, I'm okay.)  (It-aah. It hurts! IT HURTS!)  (Ugh.)
"
6,16,Kyle,"'Cause, r-tard, he's Stan from the future. He knows everything Stan knows.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"You think I can't do it?! I got a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Denver Community College! You watch me!!  Come on, everybody!
"
1,5,Kyle,"There's no Jews in San Francisco, you retard!
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Well?
"
12,6,Randy,"Gerald. Please help us.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Because I'm transginger. I looked it up: that means I can use the girls shitter.
"
5,2,Stan,"Hey, I have a great idea! Why don't we see if Jimmy wants to come be in our Scout club?
"
6,11,Stan,"I'm not going to school like this! What will all the other guys say?!
"
1,9,Cartman,"Okay, that does it!  Screw this, I'm goin home!  Talking poo is where I draw the line!
"
9,6,Butters,"God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive him!
"
10,8,Cartman,"Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I don't know, Timmy, just play along.
"
17,6,Stan,"...Dude, we've been friends a long time. Can you just tell me why you like Cartman's farts so much?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Oh well, must be a clerical mistake, but they are expecting me.
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Thank you for coming, Officer Barbrady.
"
11,9,Stan,"Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold.
"
5,14,Butters,"Well, sure I do, Mom. I love you, too.
"
14,2,Cartman,"Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it.
"
2,5,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, but you know, it-it doesn't matter though. The-the Denver team always wins, m'kay?
"
9,12,Randy,"Okay, Stan, it's late, go up to your room and get ready for bed! Let Mommy and Daddy handle this. 
"
16,3,Kyle,"But that's stupid.  How can that replace Faith Hilling? It doesn't even make any sense.
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Woohoo!  Woohoooo!)
"
4,1,Stan,"Sleds are for guys.
"
7,4,Randy,"Well, goodnight everybody. It sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Stop calling me piggy!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh, Mike, breakin' my balls, Mike.
"
3,8,Stan,"Come on. We have to find out what's happening. 
"
16,13,Stan,"What are you doing here?
"
11,7,Randy,"You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA.
"
8,6,Kyle,"Hang on, Blanket! 
"
6,5,Stan,"I knew it. I knew they wouldn't play it during the first commercial break.
"
9,11,Cartman,"See I know, I know, but I I get it now. We we've got to live and let live. 
"
5,10,Stan,"Oh, you're right. Cartman had a feeling of remorse.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Okay, go go, here he comes.  Yeah? Well then tell him we're just not interested.  Oh hey, Token! Buddy, my man, what is up?!
"
2,3,Stan,"I don't know.  Oh my God, they've killed--  Oh, never mind.
"
16,6,Cartman,"Well, come on, we don't have a choice. 
"
1,13,Cartman,"Uh huuh.
"
2,16,Kyle,"Dude, Mr. Hankey has magic powers. He can do whatever he wants. 
"
3,13,Kyle,"Dah.  Does that mean you'll go to the dance?
"
3,11,Stan,"Wow! Good job, dude!
"
12,4,Kyle,"Don't worry, Ike! The strike will be over soon! 
"
4,17,Cartman,"Alright! You know what? I have been here TOO LONG! I'm sick of making this stupid cartoon, and we're never goin' to finish it anyways!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!
"
2,8,Kyle,"I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon. 
"
16,3,Kyle,"Benedict Arnold. 
"
16,8,Cartman,"That kid is provoking us! He's saying mean things to try and piss us off.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Hey!
"
5,14,Butters,"Four days? Oh, I don't know how I'm gonna wait that long!
"
18,8,Randy,"Yes, so I'm not some fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. 
"
11,4,Cartman,"If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Thank you! Number twenty-four?  You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!
"
1,2,Cartman,"Oh look, another hippie.  Peace, Wendy.
"
11,2,Kyle,"And all the people we tell.
"
18,1,Kyle,"He's right. We should do a merger.
"
12,12,Stan,"Hey, there's some people. 
"
1,10,Cartman,"Thaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday... 
"
3,13,Cartman,"You shut up,  butthole.
"
4,13,Kyle,"Why is that bad?
"
12,14,Butters,"Oh my God, Oh my God!  Stan! Stan, we have a big problem.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Alright Butters, looks like we haaave 2.- wow, 2.4 inches. Really nice, Butters.
"
4,11,Stan,"Yeah!
"
13,4,Wendy,"Why do boys think farts are so funny? They're juvenile and gross!
"
15,8,Cartman,"Oh yeah! I saw it on the news, Kyle! The school is gonna make us all get shots again!  But this time it's so that we don't get warts in our vaginas!
"
17,1,Cartman,"I pledge it! I pledge the fucking allegiance!
"
6,3,Butters,"Aw, I feel silly.
"
1,1,Mr. Garrison,"Is there a problem, boys?
"
16,6,Cartman,"Heh, did you hear that guys? Kenny said it's just a fever blister.  You sound like a chick, Kenny. That's herpes, dude. You got that shit till you die.
"
13,11,Stan,"Wow cool.
"
13,10,Stan,"I'm having the best time!
"
5,6,Stan,"Well um, ah-I found out that Cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park. I was thinking we could put on disguises and get in.
"
5,13,Cartman,"It's...  Why, it's a miracle, you guys! 
"
5,2,Cartman,"Hehe, I don't sound like that.
"
8,9,Cartman,"I did not! I wanna close Wall-Mart just as much as you guys do!
"
16,10,Randy,"Yeah, sorry, false alarm. Pass phrase is tickle me homo.  It's a joke.
"
16,6,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
18,3,Randy,"Yeah.  The record company messed it all up. It was supposed to go ""Hunger Games, yah yah yah, yah yah yah! Hunger Games."" But they just- do what they want with my songs.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Shyeah, that was pretty funny.
"
16,1,Randy,"We've all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity.
"
18,10,Cartman,"...Very impressive, Kyle. But the holiday special is beginning soon. I'm afraid I can't let there be any distractions.  You will find that my door has been sealed with a 3/4 inch plywood and a polymer-metal alloy secured with drewall screws. 
"
3,8,Randy,"Yeah well, that, that's not really ...gay, is it?
"
16,12,Kyle,"Stan can't come.
"
12,5,Cartman,"That's Mr. Cartman now, Kyle! And you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended!  Yeahhh.  Mmm yeah, you like that?  All right, Clyde, you're first! Get up here!  Yeah, you're gonna take it, Clyde. 
"
2,15,Stan,"Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo! 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Stan, I don't think we're supposed to be in the military base. They might shoot us.
"
5,13,Stan,"I'm not the one who's leaving, he is! 
"
10,9,Kyle,"Stan! What the fuck?!
"
14,2,Cartman,"Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. 
"
14,5,Randy,"Well, yeah.
"
3,2,Stan,"No, he's not! He can't even get a nurection!
"
6,2,Kyle,"What
"
1,2,Kenny,"(They're the biggest breasts that I've seen)
"
6,1,Kyle,"But Butters isn't fat.
"
3,5,Cartman,"You... can't leave. You're my friend.
"
2,2,Cartman,"Eeeehh..!
"
6,7,Cartman,"G'night, guys.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?!  Oh crap! 
"
3,14,Cartman,"I knew they would!
"
3,12,Kyle,"Aaaah!
"
3,16,Cartman,"Okay, that settles that. Now let's talk about our periods. Kyle, you first.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Really?
"
10,2,Kyle,"Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass! 
"
10,8,Stan,"I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?
"
11,7,Randy,"He's homeless now. We aren't safe.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh, fuck my ass! 
"
13,10,Cartman,"Alright, let's start wrestlin'. 
"
2,12,Randy,"Well, hello, ladies.
"
4,12,Cartman,"No way, lady!
"
4,9,Kyle,"Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
"
10,7,Cartman,"Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news.  I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow.
"
9,9,Stan,"Nobody will. That's the way it's suppose to be. Hit it, Kenny. 
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"Not this time, Eric! You've got to learn to respect your little friends! You're gonna have detention for two weeks!
"
7,6,Butters,"Ow. Ow. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow. Naw, nothin'
"
6,11,Stan,"But if there is no other team, then it won't be any fun.
"
1,8,Stan,"Cartman, you butt-pipe, this is the time of year you're supposed to share.
"
7,5,Mr. Garrison,"Will you kids shut up?  Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are not-! Oh my God, that's Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck. 
"
3,12,Stan,"Cartman, will you stop singing Christmas carols? We have to be quiet, or else we're gonna get busted!
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"And never let poontang come between you and your friend.
"
9,4,Cartman,"Did so!
"
3,8,Randy,"One little drink isn't going to hurt anything, honey. Come on, live a little.
"
9,5,Kyle,"You mean, throw the game? You know how our parents are about this sport.
"
7,4,Cartman,"I have programmed TiVo to record over fifty hours of the History channel. When TiVo is full, both TiVo and I will be dropped into the water, combining our electrowhatever fields and sending me into a flashback of history!
"
3,3,Cartman,"After today they're gonna be fine, and I'll never have to see you ever again!
"
17,8,Butters,"Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Ike, you'll always be my little brother, okay?
"
4,2,Kyle,"Oh my God! You did lie to me.
"
13,2,Cartman,"I know, right?  ""Who is the Coon?"" It's what everyone must be asking themselves. Somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands. As for me, I certainly don't agree with the Coon's reckless ways. If you ask me, there's no room in this world for vigilantes. I believe the Coon is a menace.
"
9,14,Randy,"Well, I ran into Nelson from work. We were at the bar watching the game. Two-dollar margaritas! It was great. All right, come on, I'll drive you guys home. 
"
15,1,Kyle,"(NOOOO!) 
"
1,6,Kyle,"Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip.
"
3,13,Kyle,"Love ...is the most important thing on... earth. When boys and girls feel ...love, they kiss.
"
1,10,Stan,"Whoa!
"
5,5,Cartman,"Are you sure? I haven't seen it.
"
7,9,Kyle,"That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
"
5,4,Kyle,"Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!
"
4,9,Stan,"Alright! 
"
4,2,Cartman,"Four dollars. 
"
9,5,Butters,"Aw hamburgers. 
"
18,8,Kyle,"Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?
"
6,7,Stan,"Stop it, Tweek! We're pretending like nothing happened.
"
13,14,Kyle,"No, you're the minority!
"
14,14,Randy,"Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.
"
4,17,Cartman,"...deh..OOOWW!!!
"
11,3,Cartman,"Me?!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Yes or no, Kyle?!
"
17,8,Randy,"Happy was a good man. Too good to have died in such a brutal but festive manner.
"
15,10,Kyle,"So, just to be completely clear, now it isn't funny, right?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Kewl, thanks Kyle. Oh, and Kyle... Happy Passover!
"
3,2,Kyle,"Well, I'm Jewish.
"
1,11,Wendy,"Stan? Stan?!
"
9,9,Butters,"Well, I'm just having some fun with my girlfriends.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'...  Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme.  Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this ""Obama"" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline!  What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell!  You all know my pit boss, Butters.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Don't worry, ma'am. We'll find your doll.
"
16,12,Randy,"I just wanted to wait until the deal was all finished. We are going into business for ourselves! You are all looking at the new owner of Blockbuster Video! 
"
13,11,Stan,"Guys... guys...  Look, I really think it's time for us to do something. This is all getting way out of hand.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Hold on. I'll be right back. 
"
6,10,Kyle,"Yeah, it's cool.
"
4,10,Cartman,"There is only one answer! As kids we must abandon this town of sin and start anew!
"
1,12,Kyle,"Oh, just this really really old lady who wishes she was still only 45. 
"
8,8,Randy,"He's going to vote!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Screw you, Cartman!
"
12,14,Mr. Mackey,"Here's a couple more, Principal Victoria, hm'kay.
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, well, I don't want to sound like a dickhole, but I told you so.
"
12,10,Stan,"Kyle, calm down.
"
8,5,Butters,"Oh, that's all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. 
"
5,7,Stan,"Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?
"
5,8,Stan,"What?
"
3,10,Kenny,"(No!)
"
16,2,Stan,"What are you talking about?
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"Wooo!
"
15,9,Cartman,"Alright y'all, keep your eyes peeled and your guns ready.  There's a heap of Mexicans out there who want nothin' more than to sneak past our border, and we've gotta stop them!
"
12,3,Stan,"Yeah, and then you ran through town screaming and started tearing off all your clothes.
"
8,8,Randy,"Hey! That's not true, Stan.
"
4,4,Stan,"I know!
"
13,5,Kyle,"Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That's how people like you work! Your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself. And people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves they're awesome, when really, they're just douchebags! 
"
8,11,Cartman,"Is South Park about to explode from a methane gas leak? More on that later. But first, Stan Marsh has a look at some new outfits for the Raisins girls!
"
13,10,Cartman,"And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.
"
6,15,Kyle,"So is it a coincidence that Grandma DID talk to me about going to Jewleeard someday?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"We sure can! Well, I've got a worldwide-telecast recorder concert to get to.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Look, it's okay. We weren't here. This didn't happen, okay. We were both at my house all afternoon long playing Tea Party. Okay? Now come on, we gotta bail! 
"
13,4,Wendy,"Hey Stan, you wanna maybe study together after school?
"
2,4,Kyle,"All the time: ""Look out for your little brother, Kyle!"", ""Take care of your little brother, Kyle"", and he wasn't even really my little brother.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Yeah. I sure did. I don't think I should record that album now.
"
16,11,Kyle,"Butters, people can't just go around beating up people who have diabetes! Now whatever your problem is, you just-
"
12,1,Cartman,"Well excuse me, Kyle, for trying to keep some optimism, you know? I mean, sometimes when things... seem their darkest you just need to try and stay... HIV-positive, but if you wanna be so HIV-negative all the time, I-
"
13,12,Butters,"It does?
"
2,18,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
4,17,Stan,"It'll have everything. Jesus, Santa. And when people see it, they'll just HAVE to get in the spirit. All we need is three hundred dollars for our budget.
"
9,4,Stan,"Dude, how'd you do that?
"
12,2,Stan,"Sacrificed? For what?
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah, that it, Cartman! You don't get to have any powers!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Hello?
"
10,10,Cartman,"Bear mace that guy! And that guy! 
"
2,4,Kyle,"You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?
"
11,12,Cartman,"O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?
"
8,5,Butters,"Look at that, AWESOM-O! I drew a picture of us playing in a field together.  Ah I'll be right back. I'm gonna get some Sunny Delight. 
"
18,7,Butters,"Wow! That was cool!
"
7,2,Stan,"Stay clear, guys, stay clear.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Oh, yeah. Yeh-yeah. It's a-it's not even noticeable. 
"
17,7,Kyle,"Stan, the PS4 doesn't have the seamless transition between games, movies, and TV offered by XBox One.
"
11,14,Wendy,"So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!
"
2,14,Cartman,"Stinky britches, you got stinky, stinky--
"
13,4,Butters,"They didn't show part 2 of Terrance and Phillip!  They replaced it with the Queef Sisters!
"
12,12,Cartman,"Hey, you guys wanna buy a TV? 
"
4,2,Kyle,"I can't deal with it, Stan. I mean, all the stuff I've been reading; I really don't think I exist!
"
8,1,Butters,"Gaaaah!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Euugh. Wendy? Look at me Wendy.  There. Yeahm.
"
16,6,Cartman,"Somebody help us! 
"
2,8,Cartman,"Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?
"
13,14,Stan,"Aw come on, Kyle.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Alright, alright, shh Kenny, here come Stan and Kyle. Remember, not a word about this to anyone!
"
3,3,Stan,"He wanted money?
"
1,7,Cartman,"It's the British kid! He's a little limey zombie now!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Witty anecdotes, yes, that's been ab- that's been awesome.
"
10,9,Kyle,"Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob!  Aw, aw, awww!
"
6,13,Randy,"Oh yeah. 
"
10,1,Kyle,"Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! 
"
6,4,Stan,"Okay, very funny Cartman, now come on!
"
12,6,Kyle,"It's not working here?
"
14,4,Kyle,"I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
"
15,14,Cartman,"You've already been here awhile, Kenny, so you have to introduce me to your friends, okay? And make sure they know I'm kewl. You've gotta have my back, Kenny! 
"
7,12,Stan,"Hey Dad, how come you never told me about Joseph Smith?
"
5,6,Stan,"...Why?
"
3,2,Cartman,"Well, this sucks that I have to die, but if I die, everyone's sins will be forgiven.  So I guess it's cool. 
"
6,9,Stan,"That is our understanding.
"
4,16,Stan,"I dunno.  You guys wanna build a snow igloo?
"
12,4,Kyle,"You should care! This strike affects everybody, fatass!
"
15,4,Randy,"Great! And so divide by the 17. carry the 1, and we can see that Randy's adjusted penis size, or T.M.I., is... 6.3 inches. Do we got that? Randy's length is 4.4 inches, but his adjusted length is 6.3. So how does our example person ""Randy"" compare to others on the T.M.I. scale? By referring again to the T.M.I. chart, we see that a T.M.I. of 6.3 is .8 inches more than the national average. 
"
7,11,Kyle,"Cartman! 
"
3,3,Stan,"Come on! We're going to his house! 
"
13,8,Kyle,"Purgatory? What's that?
"
6,4,Cartman,"All right. Then we're gonna have to eat Butters. 
"
8,10,Cartman,"I don't know, son. That sounds awfully strange.  You cannot have a picture of my hot breasts.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Looks like the game is over, old man! 
"
12,5,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, ""commend"" means you've done a great job, Eric. Hm'kay?
"
3,9,Kenny,"(What?!) 
"
6,10,Randy,"Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these ""ahta"" will start becoming a major part of your life.
"
3,14,Cartman,"I'll bet you can't, because you guys are all pussies!
"
14,3,Randy,"""Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers."" Alright.  ""Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are...""  ""slow-growing and can take years to develop."" Dammit.  ""Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive."" Oh this is good. ""There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation"" Hmmm.  Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer?  Stan?
"
8,1,Butters,"Nuh uh!
"
4,9,Randy,"Let 'em be pissed off, then!
"
1,5,Kyle,"Wait, Stan, there he goes.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
"
10,12,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Check it out, dude, I'm a space man! Space man, yehesss!
"
2,13,Stan,"Here we go. 
"
14,11,Cartman,"Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!
"
1,5,Stan,"Well yeah, but pigs aren't smart, like elephants.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Hey! It's Tweek.
"
8,4,Stan,"What? The state tap champion is from here? Who?
"
4,17,Cartman,"Family?
"
6,7,Kyle,"No way.
"
11,14,Wendy,"Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in.
"
5,11,Cartman,"Heheheheheh. 
"
1,5,Stan,"Nothing, I mu-I mean, nowhere.
"
3,12,Stan,"Ow!
"
6,9,Stan,"We have to do something. Let's form a club.
"
2,15,Stan,"Where did it go?  Huhhh. 
"
16,6,Kyle,"Because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Hehey, you're right! Oho, this is great! Ben Assfleck! 
"
15,2,Stan,"Naw dude, don't make us go back in the-
"
5,6,Kyle,"Hunh, I guess you're right.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Yeah!  I was just hanging out in my room, and then I perioded all over the place.
"
11,13,Kyle,"Oh my God!
"
2,12,Cartman,"I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, ""Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!"" 
"
3,6,Cartman,"It's time to celebrate, yeahIt's time to celebrate, yeah
"
6,15,Stan,"Yes. Now, come on. Our plane is gonna leave. 
"
16,10,Cartman,"Mom, do you wanna get raped?! Haven't you seen their commercials?! You can get raped by a white guy these days, Mom!
"
2,4,Kyle,"Bye-bye seeme mama.  Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up. 
"
15,5,Kyle,"The government could come after us, Cartman.
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"What do you have to say for yourself?!  Well, I tell you what, young man. Uh, you're gonna be held back a grade if you don't luh-  Did you just flip me off?
"
13,14,Kyle,"No dude, Butters' pee is in there.
"
18,10,Cartman,"No! You can't do this!
"
7,4,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. Did you take attendance, Mr. Slave?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Sure we'll help! 
"
4,7,Cartman,"Thank you. And you'd better hope to God it still works, just like it did before.
"
11,4,Kyle,"All right, all right. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"Hoosajiggawha?
"
2,15,Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!
"
2,14,Kyle,"Well, we helped.
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh stop it, Mom and Dad.
"
15,11,Randy,"OH!  Shelly! Hold on! 
"
8,2,Jimmy,"What?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Can I ...come in?
"
12,1,Kyle,"Magic Johnson?
"
4,6,Kyle,"Alright, Cartman. I'm gonna give you... a jail-time card.  You lose a turn.
"
3,17,Stan,"I wish we could find a way to get back at those New Yorker kids.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Yeah, but I was like ""I can't you guys. I twisted my ankle."" In the end though, they really needed me to play, so I just played through the pain, you know what I'm sayin'?
"
11,13,Stan,"Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there.
"
15,13,Kyle,"I was just explaining how a negative argument doesn't make a po-
"
3,2,Randy,"Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on. His dad is better than me.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Okay, Stan, you've been an asshole to me all week! What is up?!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Extreme enough for you? How's Wednesday?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle.  Haha, hahahaha! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Oh my God! Does it look like it's getting closer? 
"
2,7,Stan,"Now we need more weight in the back.  No, that's too much! 
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh Jesus! They were??
"
6,1,Butters,"Now gosh darnit, my name's not Not-Kenny!
"
3,12,Kyle,"Then, you'll help us?
"
14,3,Cartman,"They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Three weeks?! Are you fucking kidding me?
"
6,4,Kyle,"Huh, what the hell is that?
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"No I don't!  IT'S A LIE! You see? That's what you get for bein' a teacher! You work and you work for the children and then people start rumors that you're gay even though you love poontang!
"
5,13,Stan,"But then, why does God give us anything to start with?
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, take a seat, Wendy. I guess some mean things were said and I need to get to the bottom of it.
"
1,3,Kyle,"Stan, Stan, wake up!
"
3,2,Randy,"Well, uh I don't study human biology, I study the earth.
"
6,8,Kyle,"Hey dudes.
"
13,13,Cartman,"How many Smurfberries is the life of each Smurf worth? 
"
5,9,Cartman,"God-damnit, I hate regular milk!!!
"
7,15,Kyle,"I found the number for a really cheap airline to Canada. If we go as soon as possible, then-
"
4,15,Kyle,"I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Uh-huh.) 
"
7,8,Stan,"Come on, Kyle! We're giving you a makeover! 
"
2,3,Cartman,"A-ha! 
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yeah, but what about all the people getting laid off from the grocery stores?  And what about all the- 
"
6,1,Stan,"Hey, you're the one who screwed us by not losing weight, Butters. 
"
1,1,Cartman,"No, Mr. Garrison, I'm fine. 
"
13,6,Stan,"Come on, Dad. We've gotta come clean.
"
8,13,Kyle,"This is fuckin' ridiculous!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Aww, come on!)
"
8,3,Cartman,"Mmm, one more time, Kyle.
"
10,8,Cartman,"Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?!  No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard!  No! 
"
5,2,Cartman,"That's not funny! Jesus Christ!
"
2,11,Stan,"Why are you doing this, dude?
"
6,9,Kyle,"When an artist creates, whatever they create belongs to society
"
2,2,Stan,"He was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Scott Tenorman?
"
10,3,Mr. Mackey,"Attention students: Proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement!
"
3,4,Kyle,"Fine!
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me.
"
10,4,Cartman,"It won't take long, sir.  Ow...
"
1,9,Stan,"Dude, sick!!! 
"
4,10,Cartman,"Ugh. Oh, I know.  We can use Wacky Water Weasel! 
"
7,11,Kenny,"(Yeah!) 
"
8,11,Butters,"Oh boy, I can't wait to be creative and smart.  Hohhh, it's all thick and g-gooey.
"
4,15,Stan,"No.
"
2,10,Cartman,"Well, I know one thing for sure.
"
5,9,Butters,"Stop breathin'?
"
7,4,Randy,"Oh, you think so? Bring the shizzle!
"
15,2,Stan,"All I can say is I'm glad the Germans are back in Germany and nobody's pissed off at us anymore. 
"
3,6,Cartman,"Th... That is correct, my honor.
"
4,2,Stan,"What?
"
6,9,Cartman,"Now, either you stop with these faggotronics or we'll find someone to replace YOU!
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Wwooww, that's a pretty good nose job. What do you think, Mr. Hat?
"
9,11,Cartman,"Help me! Hellp mee!
"
1,7,Stan,"Oh man, I can't believe he's gone.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Dude, that's messed up. 
"
11,5,Randy,"Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit.
"
18,6,Jimmy,"This is my fault, Stan. I should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic.
"
6,16,Randy,"Dad?? Look! We don't know you and you don't know us! Just go away before we call the police!
"
1,10,Kenny,"Quack-quack.
"
6,5,Cartman,"The time has come! Turn it on, turn it on! 
"
11,7,Randy,"You won't make it through, Gerald! 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"No need to worry about me. I'm cool like a fool in a swimming ppp-ppp-pp-pp-pool. 
"
7,6,Kyle,"Yeah, but how?
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh. Well, alright, Mom. O-o-okay then.  You know, I think the car might be movin', Mom.  Yep, I'm pretty sure the car is movin'. Looks like I'm headin' for the water.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Yes, well now you can read about all those things I've said, Butters. Take this copy of my book.
"
1,11,Cartman,"What the hell...? 
"
11,14,Stan,"Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?
"
3,15,Stan,"I'll try again.
"
6,6,Kyle,"Cool.
"
4,8,Kyle,"Yeah, me neither.
"
11,6,Cartman,"Have you lost your mind?
"
13,10,Cartman,"No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances.
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"Stanley, what the hell has gotten in to you?!  You have got severe lunchroom duty mister!
"
14,5,Cartman,"You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!
"
2,14,Stan,"We’re gonna raise your money, Chef.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Hoho! Aw man, this is awesome! Weeeee!  Oh here, Kyle, you wanna play with it a little while.  Oh, psych! You don't get to! Hehe. Oh, check it out! Cooool!
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, I don't think people are appreciating this!  It was such pwnage it was almost repulsive!
"
1,11,Cartman,"Good-bye, Ms. Ellen.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Two people with asses for heads. Ever since I saw them I can't laugh at anything.
"
5,8,Stan,"Don't care, don't care, don't care.
"
9,1,Kyle,"Well, all my life I felt I was black! I've listened to hip-hop, I watch UPN and I love playing basketball! My body doesn't reflect who I am inside.
"
1,10,Kyle,"Yeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?
"
2,3,Randy,"Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour. 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Whoa, cool.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit!
"
3,1,Stan,"They did.
"
18,7,Butters,"I'm sorry!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Nope! It has to be Kyle!
"
12,5,Cartman,"Ey! Don't commend me! It's the students' fault for being so stupid!
"
4,4,Kenny,"(Good.) 
"
5,8,Stan,"Dude, he's in there punishing my toilet.
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Uh huh.)
"
8,2,Cartman,"Um, could I get you to do something for me?
"
4,12,Stan,"No??
"
4,17,Kyle,"Dreidel dreidel dreidel-
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Alright children, as you know, we've been waiting for the absent kid's ballot to come in. Well, his mother was nice enough to bring him in from the hospital so that he could cast his vote. Ms. Harris?  Thank you very much, Billy. Don't forget to pick up your lung.  Alright, the absent kid's ballot is for...  Filmore.
"
1,7,Kyle,"Just wait till everyone sees my sweet Chewbacca costume. They're gonna be so jealous... 
"
16,3,Butters,"Well, count me out.
"
3,6,Stan,"Damnit!
"
10,11,Butters,"WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
"
2,12,Stan,"But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?  You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.
"
10,10,Cartman,"I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.
"
14,6,Stan,"That's not cool!
"
9,12,Randy,"Wasn't L. Ron Hubbard a science-fiction writer?
"
4,3,Stan,"I'm tired, Grandpa.
"
6,3,Butters,"Well yeah, I s'psoe
"
7,4,Randy,"I like to rock, but I don't wanna rock Iraq! The only kind of rockin' America should do, is the kind that we can all dance to, yeah!
"
3,4,Kyle,"Yeah, you are! You always get in trouble
"
6,7,Cartman,"Everything's gonna be okay, you guys! Life isn't so crappy after all!
"
16,10,Kyle,"It just keeps getting worse. I see stuff from Amazon almost every day. My poor dad has no idea.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Oh, Cartman! 
"
4,14,Wendy,"Oh no! NO!
"
10,7,Cartman,"Well, yeah.
"
3,2,Stan,"...What?
"
5,8,Cartman,"Hey, this is all of ours. I'm the one who found Stan's aborted brother in the trashcan and blackmailed his mom into getting the GameSphere. 
"
4,7,Stan,"This is everyone that wanted to help Kyle??
"
4,9,Kyle,"Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"You mean I'm fired?
"
4,2,Cartman,"Hm. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Work for you, have my penis cut off. Hm's see...
"
12,10,Randy,"Oh my Gohhhd!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Mom, Ike did it again. I don't know what's going on with him, but, it's like he hates me.
"
8,4,Stan,"Yeah, dude, the best dancers South Park has to offer.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Nah, nah, the cable wire must be loose. 
"
8,11,Cartman,"You see Token, people really enjoy seeing African-Americans on the news... Seeing African-Americans on the news, not hearing them. That's why all African-Americans newspeople learn to talk more... wha, how should I say... white.  Token, all the great African-Americans newspeople have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure Caucasian dialect. There's no shame in it, and I think it'll really help our ratings.
"
1,4,Kyle,"Did it work?
"
11,11,Stan,"That's not very imaginative.
"
18,9,Randy,"Look, this isn't what I want! My music is supposed to be-
"
7,3,Cartman,"So... so then, how can you feel bad?
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Guess I'll just... go on up to bed now.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!
"
9,2,Mr. Mackey,"We know you can do it, Eric. You're smart. Wha- why you're the smartest kid in school, m'kay?
"
6,1,Butters,"Uh hey, uh Eric?  Uh- thanks for coverin' for me. You're a real pal.
"
7,9,Kyle,"He's right, dude. We have to define our style if we're ever going to make a platinum album. I mean, ah I'm a fusion guy, but Kenny's background is more Latin Jazz.
"
8,14,Stan,"What the hell?
"
4,1,Kyle,"He's gotta show up. He's just got to.
"
15,10,Kyle,"Dude, that's fucked up.
"
2,9,Cartman,"I wanna Fudge 'Em.
"
6,16,Stan,"God-damnit!
"
2,15,Randy,"Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning.
"
10,14,Stan,"Well, sure we can.
"
12,1,Butters,"I just uh... well I don't know if I should be helping you make Kyle look silly.
"
10,2,Butters,"Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west.
"
7,1,Stan,"Our planet is just a reality-TV show?
"
8,9,Randy,"We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs. We'd all like you... out of South Park.
"
13,8,Stan,"Yeah, there's no way that lady judge is voting for us. She was glaring the entire time.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Kaii yo! 
"
13,10,Stan,"You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
"
2,15,Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!
"
13,13,Butters,"Wah!  Smurfkiller!  Answer for your crimes on the Morning Announcements!
"
6,9,Kyle,"Ah, I thought we were speaking for the children.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott.Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!
"
1,3,Cartman,"Yeah, cartoons kick ass! 
"
2,5,Kyle,"I know.
"
4,17,Stan,"Tralalalala
"
7,11,Cartman,"Okay, so how do you act genuinely nice to people?
"
4,17,Stan,"""Awgh! I'm so fat!""
"
11,12,Cartman,"Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?
"
16,11,Cartman,"...Wow.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Officer Barbrady, Butters didn't TP that house.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! 
"
15,2,Stan,"Yeah, I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
5,13,Kyle,"I'm leaving right now! 
"
3,4,Kyle,"Boy, do we ever.
"
4,10,Cartman,"But now we can have Communion and not go to hell, right?
"
4,4,Kenny,"(Very well, thank you.)
"
6,2,Stan,"I' seems fine.
"
18,5,Butters,"What do I do?!
"
11,12,Kyle,"Arh!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show.
"
4,8,Kyle,"I know your family's poor, but you can't just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner.
"
4,16,Kyle,"They're evil! I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS!
"
6,3,Butters,"NO I I'm not a scab.
"
4,17,Kyle,"They did it! They got it working! 
"
11,4,Kyle,"Dude, leave me alone.
"
16,5,Stan,"Oh, hey.
"
1,2,Stan,"Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's eskimos!
"
7,11,Butters,"Aren't you coming?
"
13,13,Cartman,"Would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now?
"
5,5,Cartman,"I think this new guy's funny.
"
3,2,Randy,"I am? I am, huh? I never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now.
"
9,8,Mr. Mackey,"Hey, look everybody! Helicopters! 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Thank you, Mr. Mackey.
"
14,1,Butters,"No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine.
"
10,1,Stan,"No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!
"
13,11,Randy,"Great job, son. Now the Japanese are normal, like us.
"
10,8,Cartman,"His shield and armor spells are down!
"
1,3,Stan,"Yeah.
"
4,14,Cartman,"That's the spirit, gang! Alright. Stan and Wendy, you go out and find some musical instruments! Kenny and Clyde, take some kids and buy some Thanksgiving decorations for the set! Kyle and Timmy, you go out and find a turkey!
"
14,14,Randy,"Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan.  Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh...
"
9,6,Kyle,"He probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone, we'll think he's changed and let him back into our circle.
"
9,2,Stan,"Alright, I can't take it anymore! I'm getting on that stage!
"
8,9,Randy,"Huh! Where else are we gonna get a new glass at this hour?! Everyone get your shoes on, we're goin' to Wall-Mart!
"
7,6,Kyle,"Do you kow where your doll is?
"
16,8,Wendy,"Oh Butters, you know how I feel about the captain of sports teams.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Dude, I'm not paying all this money to have some guy on the other side of the Earth try and protect me!
"
5,5,Cartman,"Weak.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Come on guys! He's hidden them somewhere and we have to find them!
"
3,5,Kyle,"Just go behind a tree.
"
16,5,Kyle,"What?! You were waiting for me in the bathroom!
"
10,9,Cartman,"We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers,  which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel?  We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well,  but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?
"
5,3,Cartman,"What's he doin' here? 
"
3,2,Randy,"...Right, right right.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Oh you guys, you're not gonna believe it!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Me too!)
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"Richard Stamos can't sing a high F, he always screws it up like this.
"
12,13,Kyle,"Aw man.
"
2,13,Kyle,"This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
"
11,1,Stan,"Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!
"
3,4,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
1,10,Cartman,"Eeeeeeh!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Here you are, Mister McCormick. Your laundry is all done and folded. That will be nine ninety five.  On your American Express.
"
4,17,Cartman,"What are you talkin' about, ""quit""? Huh! I don't remember that.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Everyone quiet! I have to think!
"
13,6,Stan,"Dad? 
"
7,9,Butters,"Hey, Eric, I don't think they can get out. 
"
16,4,Butters,"Oh, stop trying to ruin Easter, you! You heathen! 
"
13,8,Cartman,"Wait wait! Wait, look at the lady judge.  She's eating Chipotle.
"
7,11,Cartman,"I'm not, Kyle. I know you already told Butters he could go.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Nothing's wrong with me. Uh-
"
1,4,Stan,"He's part Doberman and part wolf. He's the toughest dog on the mountain.
"
1,7,Cartman,"How can he be mad with such pretty hair and rosy cheeks?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters, I talked to Oculus Customer Service, and they said I'm the one who's wearing a headset and has forgotten he's in virtual reality!
"
17,8,Randy,"Everybody stay put! I'll handle this. 
"
4,12,Kyle,"Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They're always doing science experiments in their basement.
"
5,7,Butters,"Ha-I'll be nine next week.
"
11,11,Kyle,"Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"Well, because he was being murdered.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! 
"
12,7,Kyle,"Here! Here's the phone! 
"
6,7,Stan,"Dude, it's probably in her stomach. 
"
6,4,Kyle,"All right!
"
17,8,Cartman,"I seek audience with the traitor, Lady McCormick?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, uh-- 
"
5,1,Cartman,"Huh?
"
4,10,Cartman,"Hey, you guys, you wanna know what my favorite psalm is? ""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation.  This sort of penetration will increase the population of the younger generation."" 
"
13,10,Cartman,"Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. 
"
3,2,Cartman,"Peter!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
7,5,Stan,"What's she doing?
"
2,9,Cartman,"She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him.
"
12,8,Kyle,"Indy deserved more than that!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
15,4,Randy,"And so, by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again? The yaw? The yaw of the shaft? What we finally get is the adjusted penis size, or, T.M.I. Any questions so far? Yes, little girl over there.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Why the hell not?!
"
6,4,Kyle,"But, but we, we learned things, and took up a cause.
"
8,8,Kyle,"A giant douche.
"
16,8,Stan,"Cartman, you idiot!
"
6,6,Butters,"Hu-uh, okay Mom.  Yes. Uh sleet sleep for now.  Tomorrow, the chaos begins. 
"
11,7,Cartman,"Californiania Idn't on the tona
"
8,4,Stan,"Chef, we just got served.
"
5,4,Cartman,"My pubes.
"
16,12,Butters,"I'm a wereprechaun. You know, a leprechaun that's been bitten by a werewolf. And Jimmy's Gangnam Style.
"
4,1,Kyle,"It's good to have you back, Cartman.
"
2,14,Kyle,"Did you ever know any famous people?
"
2,9,Kyle,"I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
"
9,10,Kenny,"(Our egg is okay.)
"
6,2,Butters,"Come on, Stan! 
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"Haah! Eric!
"
4,12,Kyle,"What?! Timmy! You've got to get off that chair!
"
1,3,Kyle,"Whoa!
"
8,9,Kyle,"We've gotta find the television department. 
"
3,8,Butters,"Oh dear God, they're gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-
"
17,9,Stan,"...But you couldn't just ask me. Because XBox people... don't care about the truth. They just care about seamless multimedia connectivity.
"
15,7,Cartman,"Oh cool, the movie trailers!
"
13,5,Kyle,"No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn't write the joke, then definitely don't sign any patent papers with him! Just say ""Cartman, you didn't have anything to do with this joke and you know it!""
"
3,17,Stan,"How do we write he note, Cartman?
"
12,5,Cartman,"Mexicans are told not to cheat. ""Don't cheat! You got pregnant? You have to raise the child."" So then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns.  It is at our most challenging times that we must cheat... our very hardest.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Now, I think the four million should be split evenly among the three of us, except that I should get a twenty percent per negation fee off the gross for having come up with the idea.
"
4,17,Stan,"Tralala
"
17,7,Cartman,"Yes. Good, Federation kids. You're learning to fight with your hands! Keep pushing, kindergartners!  Sir Kyle, I know that Sony's offering a special Brack Friday Bunduru. You know the XBox is still better, right?
"
12,3,Cartman,"Ah, Kenny! 
"
6,16,Butters,"Look, eh, Eric, I've been thinkin', my parents are gonna be awful sore and I don't think-
"
6,15,Stan,"No dude, you're a douche.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Kewl!
"
13,6,Stan,"Dad they aren't here for that.
"
18,6,Jimmy,"I know this stuff is hard to understand. Trust me, I know. I'm an addict too. But I got help.
"
6,7,Cartman,"We've only got one option, you guys. We're gonna have to go to that hospital where they're doing the autopsy and get our seamen back ourselves.
"
14,4,Stan,"Yahtzee. 
"
6,9,Kyle,"Calm down, Tweek. Fifteen might be enough.
"
6,2,Kyle,"Awgh, dude, I can't look. 
"
6,1,Butters,"Waaaahh!
"
15,1,Stan,"We're trying to find out exactly what Kyle agreed to.
"
17,3,Cartman,"One of them is in the back!
"
3,15,Stan,"I'll try again.
"
18,2,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, enjoy the party. 
"
2,3,Cartman,"Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!
"
8,3,Kyle,"Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. 
"
5,6,Kyle,"Why? Why, Mom? Because if I do something bad will happen to me? Because if I do your God might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids?
"
5,2,Randy,"You're the new scout leader?
"
4,17,Kyle,"We can get everyone back into the Christmas spirit by making our very own animated Christmas special, and showing it to everybody in town! 
"
16,2,Stan,"I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?
"
14,8,Kenny,"(I fucking hate you!)
"
1,6,Cartman,"You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!
"
6,7,Stan,"Just put it between his eyes.
"
15,12,Butters,"Yeah, how can the 17% be sticking it to the 83%?
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"No, they have to be able to get grades!
"
8,8,Randy,"Oh! Are you happy now, Stan? You just got yourself suspended!
"
16,13,Randy,"But I wore that wristband everywhere, and the guy's a complete phoney!  There's even more coming out about it today.
"
3,3,Kyle,"But Chef always helps us with our problems. When we have a problem, Chef sings to us and makes it better.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now.
"
4,8,Wendy,"The South Park flag!
"
15,7,Cartman,"Where's mine? Where's mine where's mine where's mine?
"
4,15,Cartman,"Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Every student is to go home and vote on their favorite choice in each category. Favorite comedy actor, favorite comedy movie. And then on Friday, during lunch and recess, we're gonna have a big, f-f-f-fantastic comedy awards show.
"
6,6,Butters,"The time for fun and games is over, feeble-minded fools! 
"
8,9,Kyle,"But you run the Wall-Mart.
"
18,1,Stan,"Yeah...
"
13,11,Stan,"Ummm, where did you get that picture?
"
4,16,Cartman,"The Provider awakes!
"
13,10,Jimmy,"Sounds good.
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, the old succubus syndrome.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmay.
"
2,18,Kyle,"But we found a frozen ice man from the past! 
"
9,8,Stan,"Because, I know what did cause the flood.
"
10,4,Cartman,"Son of a bitch.
"
13,14,Kyle,"I am not, not, d-rinking pee!
"
3,10,Randy,"Chinpoko ga dai-suki yoo! 
"
8,10,Stan,"Dude, are we gonna be like that someday?
"
8,2,Jimmy,"S-s-ss-s-s-steroids?  ...But aren't those illegal?
"
3,4,Stan,"Hey, you guys. How are you feeling?
"
6,13,Kyle,"That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!
"
5,8,Stan,"No. 
"
8,13,Cartman,"This is gonna be totally cool, you guys.
"
10,7,Cartman,"God dammit stop ignoring me!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Whoa, here it goes! 
"
2,3,Kenny,"(Goddammit, Cartman!)
"
1,5,Stan,"Hey uh, you guys want to come over to my house?
"
10,6,Cartman,"Check out this sweet move.  Kyle, you can't block like that.
"
5,7,Stan,"""That's what you said last time , but obviously we must now resort to more drastic measures"" 
"
2,17,Cartman,"Oh, are you gonna take us to your little pussy house?
"
2,16,Kyle,"Charlie's right! I'm not gonna let some fake Mr. Hankey spoil my holidays.
"
5,4,Stan,"When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!
"
7,12,Randy,"Well, thanks. Uh...
"
11,10,Butters,"Okay, will do. Faggot out.  Waagh.
"
3,11,Stan,"Dude, you're gonna get busted for taking this thing.
"
1,4,Stan,"I don't know where Sparky is. He usually follows me to football practice.
"
4,2,Cartman,"You know, the tooth fairy forgot to bring me money last night! Call the police!
"
8,11,Stan,"You guys. You guys, wake up! 
"
6,14,Butters,"But they killed Lemmiwinks!
"
1,6,Stan,"Good night grampa.
"
18,6,Stan,"Ohhh hey guys.
"
3,14,Kyle,"Come on, Cartman! How much do you wanna bet the South doesn't win?!
"
3,7,Cartman,"They mostly come at night, mostly.  Ey, I was watching Aliens on TV!
"
6,2,Stan,"Where the hell have you guys been?!
"
3,17,Kyle,"Well, let's try the dictionary.  queasy, Quebec, queen quelch. No queef.
"
6,9,Cartman,"Yeah, if you offer free hats, m-maybe people will show up.
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope.
"
12,1,Kyle,"An apology?!
"
18,8,Kenny,"(NO.)
"
6,16,Randy,"Who is it, Sharon?
"
12,12,Butters,"We lost?
"
7,12,Stan,"No!
"
8,1,Stan,"Just run with it, dude.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell is going on?!
"
18,3,Randy,"Yes. Yes, Stan. I am Lorde.
"
4,3,Stan,"What?!
"
2,12,Randy,"No, I was just uh flipping through the channels. 
"
2,12,Stan,"Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?
"
1,10,Cartman,"Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.
"
9,1,Kyle,"Ih it's me, Kyle Broflovski. I had a negroplasty. Can I play in the All-State team now?
"
3,11,Stan,"Kick ass!  Wow, this thing is awesome!
"
1,12,Kyle,"Triangle of Zinthar?
"
10,3,Kyle,"I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that.
"
15,5,Kyle,"A thousand dollars.
"
7,15,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
1,6,Kyle,"I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"To the planetarium.
"
12,1,Stan,"Well, did... Elton John sing a song for you?
"
5,2,Randy,"Oh my God.
"
11,5,Randy,"I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time.
"
2,9,Cartman,"It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?
"
14,8,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
10,6,Cartman,"Eh! 
"
8,13,Cartman,"Fine, Kyle! You asked for it! Hee-at! 
"
10,7,Cartman,"This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Screw you, hippie!
"
16,14,Cartman,"MOOOM! I can't find my mooom!
"
3,12,Stan,"Christmas?
"
4,2,Kyle,"Me too. 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Uhh yes, of course?
"
3,4,Kyle,"Mr. Adler?
"
15,11,Stan,"Dad? Dad, you have to come back. This isn't working out.  Please answer the phone Dad.  Dad?
"
2,18,Stan,"Gorak!  Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?
"
8,10,Kenny,"(I'll do it.)
"
1,9,Kyle,"Uuuuuuhh...
"
7,9,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
12,2,Butters,"Hokay. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes.
"
7,11,Cartman,"But I...  but...  Stand back!
"
3,3,Stan,"So you made sweet love to her down by the fire.
"
17,1,Butters,"I can't think of anywhere I'd rather be than at the DMV with all you wonderful people. Now let's all pledge Allegiance.  I pledge allegiance.
"
7,4,Randy,"No, but war shouldn't be our goal.
"
14,9,Randy,"It's Al Qaeda!  Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! 
"
3,3,Stan,"Jesus dude! 
"
7,5,Cartman,"OHH, SICK!! AWW THAT'S IT!  WE'RE LEAVING NOW!!
"
10,12,Kyle,"You'll die, retard!
"
7,7,Stan,"Oh sure. Until the Native Americans decide they want that land, too! What if the Native Americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh, until we have nowhere else to go?? We have to stand up to them now!  Rrrgh! Forget it! Come on, you guys! 
"
17,9,Stan,"You don't understand. I'm never playing Call of Duty with you again.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Uh oh.
"
4,7,Timmy,"Timmiihh.
"
2,10,Kyle,"I can't say ""ookie mouth"" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible. 
"
8,11,Cartman,"How about we do a show where we kill Butters? 
"
6,12,Cartman,"Not by giving me brain damage!
"
10,6,Kyle,"Why?
"
3,15,Kyle,"Hoh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
13,1,Kyle,"What's that?
"
4,17,Kyle,"You could do Cartman's voice, can't you?
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
3,2,Randy,"I-I don't know what to say.
"
6,7,Mr. Garrison,"Well it was a nice project while it lasted, boys.
"
16,2,Stan,"You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! 
"
11,7,Cartman,"I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Oh yeah! That feels good, doesn't it? Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don't think I need to tell you there's a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us. And if there's one thing I've learned, is that the only way to fight hate, is with more hate! We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!
"
16,11,Kenny,"(Please, could you just let him on the plane? It's really important. Please?)
"
4,8,Mr. Mackey,"Oo, Wednesday? Uh-Wednesday's tough. I guess- maybe I could do somthin' uh, Thursday afternoon.
"
1,1,Stan,"Bleech!
"
12,8,Kyle,"Move on?! Our friend was raped, Stan! He was raped, and we all stood there and did  nothing!
"
1,10,Kyle,"It's a game, dude. It's really fun.
"
13,13,Cartman,"That'll be five dollars.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-
"
11,13,Kyle,"Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway.
"
3,1,Stan,"Dude! Maybe you really don't have any rhythm. 
"
13,10,Kyle,"So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
"
16,8,Butters,"Oh, all right. Well all right, here you go. 
"
16,10,Cartman,"A man just broke into my house and is-  Varashnu? I didn't sign up to have some Indian guy call me- Are you even in the United States?!
"
8,7,Cartman,"You're so lucky I have a... sore shoulder, Kyle, or I would have let you have it.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Come on, boys. You're holdin' up the bus.  Oh, wow, look. It's Kenny G himself. Thank you for a wonderful concert, Mr. G.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Yeah I'm good. How are you, Kyle?  They're all gonna pay! Every day they pushed me and pushed, and if it happens again today, it's going to be the last time.  We'll find out today at recess, won't we? Oh yes, we'll find out today at recess.
"
4,1,Stan,"Wow. I really wish I hadn't sat here and watched that.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Nothin' to do now but wait.
"
4,6,Stan,"This is boring.
"
14,2,Cartman,"It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!
"
10,14,Randy,"NOOO! NOT AGAIN! NOOO! 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Kyle, you're bein' an asshole! Now let's do this thing and get out of m'yeah.  Here's what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! 
"
3,4,Cartman,"Fine, that's fine!
"
1,13,Kyle,"Dammit!
"
2,15,Stan,"Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice.
"
5,7,Kyle,"Is that what you learned in sex ed?
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"And that, children, is what you need to know about The Facts Of Life. So, let's review.  Tootie left in the fourth season, but Blair and Jo stayed on and got husbands, leaving the fifth and sixth seasons hideously stagnant.  Okay children, that's lunch. See you in thirty minutes. 
"
13,3,Cartman,"Don't you fraternize me! This is all your fault, you know!
"
13,1,Kyle,"...Well, what does that mean?
"
6,10,Kyle,"Me?? Dude, I've been here since the beginning!
"
3,3,Stan,"Who are you?
"
4,14,Cartman,"Cool! Can you get it for us?
"
10,6,Mr. Mackey,"No, the last one.
"
15,10,Stan,"Lemmiwinks? Our old class gerbil?
"
16,12,Stan,"No! Dude, please! This is my best friend's iPad!  Noo! Okayokay, okay! Their names are Bruce, Tony, and Curt
"
18,3,Cartman,"Do you know your girlfriend's going around tellin' everyone that you're gay?!  Oh yeah! She's got the whole school believin' that she's attracted to girls, but she's dating you! So what does that make you, Stan?! A girl! Stan-an's a gir-rl! You'd better curb your dog, Stan! You'd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you! 
"
9,13,Cartman,"I think there's a sea lion show at 2:30.
"
2,16,Kyle,"Dude, I was having this horrible nightmare that we were at this house, and it was filled with Cartmans!
"
5,4,Cartman,"What?
"
7,9,Kyle,"Hold it.  Pops, I've got the music inside me. It's in my soul. And I know my place is up on that stage. I'm gonna make it to the top. And I just want your blessing, Pops.
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Look, Mom. I just fixed you a drink.) 
"
4,13,Stan,"Well, yeah, or we could just kill him.
"
16,4,Cartman,"There's... no way. No way Jewpacabra is real.  Those, those cryptozoologists don't know what they're talking about. They just... they just gave me a case of the Hebrew jeebies that's all... Eh, eaah.  Hey. Jewpacabra can't be real, right? Tell me again why it can't be real?  I mean, it's impossible that something I made up could turn out to actually exist, huh, Kyle?
"
12,13,Stan,"You see? They need you. This is fate, kid, fate.
"
1,11,Wendy,"Wwhat?
"
9,13,Stan,"Okay, Manuel, hit it. 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Gay.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oh God.
"
4,1,Stan,"If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?
"
13,13,Wendy,"Sure.
"
6,13,Randy,"Uh, boys,  Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?
"
8,10,Cartman,"It's my mom's taser. I took it from her purse.  Just back off, man!
"
3,12,Cartman,"God-damnit, mom!
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh boy, this is great! My week just keeps getting better.
"
14,8,Butters,"Hello! 'Scuse me!  I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all  fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome!  Heh! I helped the needy! 
"
5,11,Randy,"Well, yeah, but I have one question about the way it works.
"
15,14,Kyle,"How was jail, fatass?!
"
15,10,Stan,"No, I was telling Kenny he would like it.
"
1,11,Cartman,"Nuh-uh!
"
8,10,Kenny,"(All right!)
"
5,11,Cartman,"Haha,  serves you right, asshole. 
"
3,16,Stan,"No it's not! It's terrible!  Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. How come you didn't help me? I know you're really busy with things, but this is a matter of life and death. If I don't get my period, my friends won't let me hang out with them on New Year's Eve. Please, please give me my period soon.
"
10,13,Cartman,"Noooo!  I'm back. Wow! I'm back!
"
13,10,Stan,"I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
"
7,6,Butters,"Fellas! Hehey fellas! I got it! Ah I got my semen sample!
"
4,13,Stan,"Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! 
"
2,18,Stan,"Wow, that sucks, dude.
"
6,15,Stan,"Alright, look. I'll show you. I just need a volunteer. How about you?
"
3,14,Stan,"Oh, no.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Ye-yes.
"
9,8,Kyle,"Huh?
"
9,3,Stan,"Two four nine all right, this is the place.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Fifty-five daura.
"
1,2,Cartman,"Kick ass!
"
6,16,Butters,"Oh, not really sir, I just uh...
"
5,13,Cartman,"You're gonna love these fetuses, Larry. They're top notch.
"
18,2,Randy,"No! Not Papa John's.  I don't wanna go to Papa John's!  YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO TO PAPA JOOOHN'S!!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Mommy, I want my Mommy! 
"
10,6,Stan,"Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.
"
13,3,Stan,"I got a hundred dollar check from my grandma, and my dad said I need to put it in the bank so it can grow over the years.
"
2,12,Stan,"Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play.
"
1,10,Cartman,"They're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Thanks a lot, Ike!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Aw man, now every douchebag in town has a weapon! Lame!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Aah, three dollars.
"
18,6,Kyle,"Y-you alright?
"
4,11,Cartman,"He said there is water in hell, but if you drink it you pee blood out your ass for seven hours-uh!
"
2,12,Randy,"I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
"
8,1,Cartman,"I told you it was a wardrobe malfunction. 
"
4,3,Stan,"Dude, this isn't working.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Whoopee.
"
1,13,Stan,"Dude, this is going to be the funniest tape ever made.
"
1,13,Cartman,"Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.
"
11,14,Kyle,"Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!
"
15,8,Kyle,"Dude, come on Cartman. As employees, don't you think we should get to see what the final secret flavor enhancer is?
"
6,1,Butters,"Well, I know, ah I can't seem to lose it.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Hay, wait a minute.
"
14,14,Randy,"Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?
"
5,5,Kyle,"They said they'd come.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!
"
1,4,Kyle,"Cartman, you hike me the ball, then somebody run, and I'll throw it at something. Ready?!
"
16,1,Mr. Garrison,"Quick, sue him!
"
17,1,Cartman,"Bill Clinton.
"
16,11,Stan,"Butters?
"
9,7,Butters,"Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk.  You see, Jimmy, when a man's penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her ""vagiiina.""  Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady's tummy, and after it's all done sneezin' milk, the penis stops bein' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.
"
17,9,Cartman,"You guys wanna p-play outside or something? 
"
9,1,Cartman,"He's a Jewish dolphin. A Jewphin.
"
16,13,Stan,"No, I just, I don' know. No.
"
13,13,Wendy,"I believe there is a ...few things wrong with the school, but-
"
8,14,Stan,"Oh, Goddammit! 
"
17,2,Kenny,"(I knew you're up to something!)
"
4,11,Kyle,"The only thing of yours that's larger in size is your big fat ass!
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"I am tired of seeing you in my office, young man!  You get sent here every day, Craig!
"
12,8,Stan,"Let's just go, Let's just go! 
"
15,5,Cartman,"Look, you morons, Slash clearly has a fan club, right?! So just go to the post office, and find out where the mail gets in, and then you'll have Slash's home address!
"
18,2,Kyle,"We're not bailing on the party, we're just think there's... more important things right now!
"
13,1,Kyle,"What?!
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Me too.)
"
5,2,Cartman,"Eh, we kick ass.
"
13,14,Jimmy,"Wha-what are you talking about, Eric?
"
2,3,Cartman,"Reading sucks ass.
"
1,8,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
13,10,Stan,"Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!
"
13,4,Cartman,"Sick! Stop it, lady!
"
5,9,Kyle,"Dude, what's going on?
"
1,13,Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my corned beef cabbage!
"
5,2,Stan,"Please, Big Gay Al. We don't wanna go on a camp trip with this guy next week.
"
13,9,Butters,"You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
"
5,7,Cartman,"So I don't get AIDS.
"
9,14,Stan,"Ah, excuse me, who's in charge here?
"
8,1,Cartman,"Looks like we have a sworn enemy, you guys.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Well, you're pretty ugly, but, you don't have to be dating 22-year olds. I mean, what kind of scumbag asshole dates 12-year old girls?
"
12,2,Kyle,"Yes they are! I have an idea.
"
1,2,Wendy,"You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.  I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place.
"
14,5,Kyle,"You should know, fatass.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I have a lot of demons that I need to face, father. I need to know some things.
"
7,12,Cartman,"Yeah. Somebody need sto put him in him place!
"
13,13,Butters,"The students want answerrrrs! Go on the Morning Announcements if you've got nothing to hide!
"
10,8,Randy,"Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Go on and go home, you fat chicken!
"
17,8,Butters,"Come on, Scott! We're leaving! 
"
11,4,Cartman,"But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?
"
10,8,Randy,"Give me the sword.
"
6,16,Randy,"Oh... Well... Son, we've just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are.
"
10,12,Stan,"Well there could still be a god.
"
14,2,Cartman,"Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!
"
13,9,Butters,"I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Come on, twinkle stars, we got work to do.
"
16,8,Stan,"What?
"
12,11,Cartman,"You know what, we're getting pretty sick of your attitude, Craig.
"
12,13,Stan,"That's right. You know, sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you. There's things we're all good at. And we just can't keep them bottled up inside. 
'Cause you gotta do what you wanna do.
Don't let nothin' get in your way, chase your dream every day. 
True, girl, you know it's true,
that if you really wanna be you, you've gotta do what you wanna do. 
He was unhappy 'cause he just wanted to play ball
"
10,1,Butters,"My Uncle Bud did that to me once! 
"
1,8,Kyle,"Yeah!
"
10,14,Stan,"Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Ey! What the hell is wrong with you people?!
"
5,1,Kyle,"We need some help identifying an ancient English stone.
"
10,10,Cartman,"I got some badass guys to help me.
I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.
You think you got away with not having a hall pass?
You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again!  How was that, Butters?
"
10,6,Cartman,"That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there  if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.
"
6,16,Cartman,"God, it's so hard to find good help.  Ah! Butters, like what you're seeing so far?
"
10,10,Cartman,"Hall infraction! 
"
6,9,Cartman,"Think about it. Spielberg? Jew. Lucas? Jew. Kyle? Jew. Coincidence?
"
13,4,Butters,"Ohhhhh ohhhhh!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Do you know what this is?!  This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. 
"
18,6,Stan,"No, no, it's not.
"
4,2,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
4,14,Cartman,"But  Mo-o-om, I have to write these lyrics so the plight of Helen Keller can be realized by the common man.
"
15,8,Cartman,"A what??
"
13,6,Randy,"Whaaat? Oh my God, not Finland.
"
14,3,Randy,"Medicinal marijuana.  There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Then eat your puke.
"
14,14,Randy,"Fraîche.
"
4,1,Stan,"Dude, if Kenny takes Cartman to Mexico, how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on Saturday?
"
4,15,Wendy,"Uhh, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"...So the Pope says, ""What are you, a stinking e-evolutionist?""
"
2,6,Cartman,"Was it fun?
"
5,13,Cartman,"My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado. My best friend in the whole world is Kenny McCormick and he, he's sick right now. He's real sick. He's only eight years old and his doctors don't think he has very long to live. Look, I realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject, but... All I know is that if there's a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend's life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds.  I love Kenny McCormick and...  I want you to love him too.  And I uh, I'm not the best speaker in the world. Maybe I can put it best in the words of a timeless song 
It was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment shone in your eyes
I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
"
6,16,Randy,"Stan...
"
6,1,Cartman,"Alright alright, I'll stay here and answer the phone for you.
"
16,12,Randy,"Oh, ah, I believe we have that over in the uh-
"
3,8,Stan,"Dad! You can't leave me here! These guys are total Melvins!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Pube fair?
"
6,12,Stan,"Let's just keep building. We only have five more days until the shopping spree.
"
3,13,Stan,"Dude, we're gonna go duct-tape that Mark kid to the bleachers. You wanna help? 
"
5,8,Kenny,"(Help help! Heeelllppp!) 
"
16,2,Cartman,"Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
"
8,5,Butters,"AWESOM-O?  Hey, what are you doin' with him?!  That's my robot!  AWESOM-OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
"
5,5,Kyle,"Nuh, it's more important than that. Our school is putting on a big show for Earth Day, and we promised people we could get you to perform.
"
11,2,Cartman,"I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
"
9,14,Randy,"Well uh, I'm, s'posed to tell you kids about how bad drinking is, um... I'd-did a little drinking and driving. As part of my punishment I'm... doing community service work at schools like these.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Jesus Christ, these lines are ridiculous! I'm gonna miss my flight!  E- Excuse me, there are two other security checkpoints. Why can't you open those, too?
"
13,11,Kenny,"(I just want to be on TV.)
"
4,10,Kyle,"Stan! You've got to help us become good Christians. Please.
"
18,9,Randy,"No I'm eh... I know for a fact that I don't sound the same live.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Oh goddamnit, nobody's doing anything kewl!  I'm so bored! Everything is so stupid!
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Yiou know, those types! Rich people! 
"
3,3,Stan,"Yeah. Usually when he ditches school, he still shows up for lunch.
"
4,15,Mr. Garrison,"But that's not the question.
"
11,8,Butters,"Uh hey Eric!
"
2,17,Stan,"Wow, that sucks, dude.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. 
"
16,12,Stan,"All right Avengers, what say we take this scumbag down?!
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Okay. Stanley, we're all here to get to the root of your behavior disorder.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Is this some kind of joke?
"
4,12,Butters,"Huh-it sure was.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Well, now that doesn't really have any logical sense, Mommy, because I'm already being punished by not getting the iPad. Mama. Please, can we just go back and get the Toshiba Handibook?
"
12,5,Mr. Garrison,"Well then get an AIDS test, Thompson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot!  Yeah! I'm back!
"
5,13,Kyle,"Cartman?
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih!!
"
1,13,Kyle,"Wow, I wish we had a stupidest home video. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"Satisfied with-  Wait a minute. What medication?!
"
18,7,Kyle,"Hey Cartman, I need to talk to you.
"
18,1,Kyle,"Well whattaya mean?
"
13,13,Butters,"Hey Wendy! Wendy! Is it true?
"
13,10,Kyle,"Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!
"
16,11,Butters,"You just think you know everything, don't you Kyle?! Every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like you're the frickin' expert! Well you don't know everything because  your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about HIS image!  You guys think Cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school? You're all fake and stuck up , and none of you have the courage to tell Jimmy that his jokes aren't funny!  The only kid here with any sense of dignity is Kenny, and the rest of you have your heads up your butts! 
"
2,18,Stan,"I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out.
"
9,12,Randy,"Come on, Mr. Cruise, this is ridiculous.
"
3,17,Kyle,"What the hell is that lady talking about?
"
18,2,Kyle,"We were- trying to be funny.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Awwwww!
"
11,5,Stan,"I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh! Yes! 
"
18,8,Kyle,"Can Kenny block his elderbeast?
"
11,11,Cartman,"Theee conference room is which way? 
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah. Hey, hey, you guys know why richers have such big garages? 'Cause they need a place for all their Porsches and boats and aircraft carriers!  Yeah, that's right, cashchucker! Go have fun with your two million dollar house! 
"
9,4,Kenny,"(Friday)
"
13,8,Cartman,"Because he was a great person, Kyle.
"
10,6,Kyle,"Yes you can!
"
1,8,Kyle,"Hey, it looks like one of those Etheropians.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. 
"
8,8,Kyle,"Kenny, what's funnier? A giant douche or a turd sandwich?
"
17,2,Mr. Mackey,"Butters, your dad threw you down a well?
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Hat, what do you think you're doing?
"
17,7,Randy,"Hey,  that's what I'm talkin' about. You got any extra of that?  Oh, thanks!  Gets a little boring around here, you know? 
"
14,10,Stan,"Did you come here to help me?
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"Yes way! M'kay, and that settles it! Now, let's all go- 
"
2,15,Kyle,"You can't be standing there, Cartman.
"
4,16,Cartman,"We're running out of time! Hand our book over, quick!
"
2,9,Cartman,"Ay!
"
3,8,Stan,"Come on, Angels. We've got a new mission. And this time, it's for real. 
"
9,3,Stan,"Wow, two hundred dollars. Can you imagine?
"
5,11,Cartman,"Kyle, Kyle!  I just found out that in World War II, some Jewish people were sent to concentration camps.
"
1,4,Stan,"Okay, uh. Asian culture has, plagued our fragile earth for many years. We must end it-
"
11,2,Kyle,"You figured that out, huh?
"
2,9,Wendy,"Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Mayor! Mayor, I confirmed the data! The hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert!
"
11,9,Randy,"These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans! 
"
12,11,Cartman,"That guy's an asshole!
"
16,3,Cartman,"Oh, please. Bradying is to 2000 and lame.
"
5,4,Cartman,"I just finished planning a brilliant  li'l scheme  that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. 
"
15,7,Kyle,"Wait wait it-it's Stan's birthday.
"
16,11,Kenny,"(Okay, okay! I'll go.) 
"
14,2,Cartman,"That inconsiderate jerk!
"
14,14,Randy,"Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!
"
9,14,Cartman,"Nah-uh, I don't raku disciprine!
"
18,8,Stan,"Do you think they're happy?
"
11,9,Randy,"Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. 
"
4,4,Kyle,"Bastard.
"
12,10,Kyle,"I don't get it, Kenny: why do you buy razors and shaving cream?
"
3,2,Stan,"Let's see: Jesus got crucified, then he died, then three days later he had his urection. Let's see, there's fourteen Stations of the Cross. Now, it says we can makes costumes out of sheets.
"
18,3,Cartman,"No! God damn it no!  Who's takin' a shit?!
"
4,14,Randy,"Ey, Gerald, maybe after the show we can make copies of each other's tape so we have both.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Do you really think I'm that stupid?! That I believe all of this all along has been me living out some kind of virtual reality fantasy? Fuck you! 
"
14,14,Randy,"Mmm, God damn. Yeah.
"
10,12,Butters,"Yeah...I guess it is...
"
17,2,Randy,"Yes ah, I'm getting it now.
"
11,11,Kyle,"...What?
"
5,3,Kyle,"What are we doing?
"
2,7,Stan,"Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree did make up that stuff about the big black monster. 
"
13,11,Stan,"What? 
"
3,10,Cartman,"No, Kitty! 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Hello Jim.
"
12,13,Cartman,"There's not- there's not even condiments on his baloney sandwich!
"
13,10,Cartman,"Huh?
"
2,10,Stan,"Goody? What do you mean, ""goody""?!
"
4,16,Kyle,"Well I wish I didn't have any parents! 
"
12,1,Kyle,"Tattle-tale?! Do you know how serious this is?!
"
8,4,Butters,"Whoops. 
"
10,4,Kyle,"Hello? This can't be right, I-  Ow!
"
12,2,Stan,"I know where.
"
1,8,Cartman,"Hey, somebody get me out of here! This sucks!
"
7,11,Cartman,"They're coming this way! I can hear them coming. They'll find you down here for sure. And when they do, they'll eat you alive.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Uhuh.
"
8,5,Cartman,"What?
"
14,4,Stan,"Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
"
8,3,Kyle,"I am picking up carbon-based life forms in Sector C. I believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge. 
"
2,6,Cartman,"You're dead, Stan.
"
4,12,Cartman,"Yeah,  get out of here! 
"
2,10,Kyle,"Ookie mouth!  Gross! I can't do it, Ma!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Really?
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh, that- You were talking about that alien. Oh yeah that one, he was here, yeah. He landed here, but we... we killed him.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Hold it, hold it, stop!  What. The fuck. Was that?
"
2,11,Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-
"
11,1,Kyle,"I have no idea.
"
8,3,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Right. Because you and Mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Tell us about it!
"
9,6,Butters,"Really. I mean, honestly, I don't know how you're gonna make up for all this.
"
5,4,Kyle,"You're such a dumbass, Cartman. 
"
13,7,Butters,"Huh?
"
16,6,Stan,"I think we're good.
"
2,2,Stan,"Oh, weak. 
"
10,3,Cartman,"We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?
"
1,8,Cartman,"I get to use it first you guys!  Mom, did our digital sports watch come yet?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Well, Shelly, he's 22. What, what were you doing with him anyway?
"
5,13,Stan,"I can't see him like that, Kyle. All those hoses and wires. He's a kid, dude. He's s'posed to be running around and laughing.
"
2,7,Cartman,"I don't wanna.
"
1,13,Stan,"Grampa!! 
"
6,10,Timmy,"Arf! Ah Timmah! Timmah-ar-argh!
"
3,13,Stan,"Yeah. I wonder how Cartman is doing with his home-schooling.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Uncle Howard, what are you doing here?!
"
3,8,Butters,"Uhuh wuhwe've got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. 
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Yeah, Dad. We've been going out since we met in Free Period last week.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Sucky-sucky, five dollar.
"
4,10,Stan,"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art though amongst wo-
"
18,1,Cartman,"It's the same thing, Kyle! The point is, if we as an organization claim to be about high morality, somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and it's most likely going to be Butters.
"
8,5,Butters,"He can do anything I command him to. He's real smart. Watch this: Hey AWESOM-O, will you go get my friends some Sunny Delight?
"
9,4,Kenny,"(What the fuck is going on?)
"
18,7,Kyle,"Uh huh.
"
8,7,Cartman,"It works, doesn't it? Did I not just get us an extra five bucks?
"
3,14,Cartman,"God bless those men that fight for their freedom. God bless those men! And God bless the Confederasah!
"
5,4,Cartman,"So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a  li'l ol' scheme  that involves them.
"
16,7,Butters,"In...in who, Eric?
"
4,6,Stan,"Well, Cartman, you got everybody into this, you have to figure out a way to get everybody out.
"
12,4,Stan,"...Yeah.
"
5,8,Stan,"We're just going in to get our video game back.
"
14,9,Randy,"On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. 
"
2,10,Cartman,"Hooray!
"
12,2,Kyle,"Now, wait a minute! Everyone just stop for one minute!  Look, you guys are gonna end up killing her. Can't you see that Britney isn't in any condition to handle this crap anymore? I know watching celebrities go down can be fun. Me and my friends are just as guilty as all of you, but maybe, we'll just, maybe, ...it's time to let this one go. Just this one time, let's, let's all stop before it's too late, huh?
"
3,8,Stan,"You're right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. 
"
9,13,Kyle,"Alright guys, listen up! This may sound a little strange, but, the whale, at the Denver Sea Park, is going to die, unless we get it to the moon,
"
9,12,Randy,"Aw rats. 
"
16,10,Randy,"Oh, and then we'd miss out on all the fun! 
"
3,4,Stan,"Aw, hell!
"
9,4,Stan,"Are we in trouble or something?
"
16,4,Cartman,"I'm alive!  I'm alive, you guys.  I don't know how, but I'm alive!  Can you believe it? It's a miracle.  Listen everybody, last night I almost died. But then a Passover miracle happened. The Jewpacabra passed me over, and by the power of Jehovah I somehow woke up safely in my bed. I learnt a big lesson. It's wrong, guys. Christ didn't die for our sins and God is angry. It's time for us all to stop this Easter ridiculousness, accept Jehovah as our God and deny Christ.
"
13,4,Butters,"Robbed us of our innocence... 
"
10,6,Cartman,"NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. 
"
15,7,Stan,"Me?! Did you see that shit?!
"
17,7,Randy,"No, I was just uh, looking at all these great things I can't afford, heh.
"
6,13,Butters,"Precious.  Let me see my precious.  Plee-ee-ee-ease! 
"
13,4,Randy,"Jesus Christ!
"
9,5,Randy,"Yeah!
"
6,13,Randy,"Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet.
"
16,4,Cartman,"No, Kyle! I don't believe you!
"
17,7,Cartman,"It is real, Craig! I saw it on the news, butthole!
"
8,7,Stan,"Ma'am, do you have a rag and some bandages?
"
5,1,Randy,"Ya know, that word's kind of getting old. It's not really... funny anymore.
"
15,10,Kyle,"What?
"
5,12,Randy,"Yeah. You'd become what you hate.
"
4,14,Kyle,"...God-damnit, here!  Alright, Timmy, let's go! 
"
18,1,Stan,"I just... never saw myself owning a company called ""Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly on the Table, INC.""
"
8,13,Kyle,"Cartman, what did you do?!
"
11,2,Butters,"I'm getting a surprise! 
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Aww.)  (Okay, you guys, we've gotta get back to the camp and... )
"
16,6,Kyle,"Can we please go faster?!
"
16,6,Stan,"Yeah, his, his cold sore is really bad, and uhh he's losing blood, so we've gotta go.
"
16,8,Stan,"Dad?
"
16,11,Stan,"What?
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, is there a problem?
"
8,10,Kyle,"Well...  Well, what do you want?
"
7,7,Stan,"Wow, dude.
"
2,17,Cartman,"Yeah, he called me a pussy! I'm not a pussy, you're a pussy!
"
8,5,Cartman,"What?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back.  From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny.
"
3,1,Stan,"All we ever heard growing up was, ""Save the rainforest. The rainforest is fragile""!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Fucking gross!
"
2,15,Stan,"What are you doing?!
"
6,12,Stan,"It wa a trick!
"
7,13,Kyle,"This is just startin' to look like another one of those times where it-it's gonna end up with the whole town turning out, it's a big showdown happening, and us havin' to talk about what we learned, and I say we just stop right now, and go play cards or something.
"
8,10,Kyle,"Look, that was a long time ago. Maybe Trent Boyett has forgotten all about it.
"
12,7,Stan,"Sounds like police sirens.
"
12,7,Stan,"Jesus Christ!  We've gotta call the police. Where's your phone?
"
7,10,Stan,"What's that?
"
4,4,Timmy,"Erh Timmiihh!!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Ooo livin' a lie!
"
7,5,Kenny,"(Woohoo!) 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow, Shawna, you look f-fantastic.
"
1,5,Cartman,"Well, good job Einstein, why don't we just build a rocket in the meantime?  Hey!
"
6,7,Kyle,"Wow, I guess this really is a big deal.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Ow! 
"
7,14,Kyle,"God damn it!  Wendy, Stan wants to know why you break up. 
"
8,9,Randy,"Anu-nothing!  I'ma-I'ma-I'm just gonna head down to the Wall-Mart real quick.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Oh right! ""The School Faculty Tries To Poison All Their Students."" That's not gonna be on Wikileaks!
"
7,15,Cartman,"Everyone's gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying Christmas presents!!  You fucking Jews ruined Christmas again!!  AAAAAA!! 
"
1,3,Cartman,"Shut up, I didn't pee in my pants!
"
4,9,Stan,"Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat!
"
8,14,Stan,"I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
"
3,10,Kyle,"But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
"
2,12,Stan,"Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.  Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.  American base is only a few feet away.
"
10,8,Cartman,"Heheh, totally, heheh.
"
1,1,Cartman,"No!
"
9,3,Kyle,"All that time and effort we spent helping Token and this is the thanks we get?!
"
15,8,Randy,"It's pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent, and then the ""government"" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a ""mentally incapacitated"" freak! I mean look at him. He's disinterested, depressed, self-loathing. It's most likely the reason his mother and I got divorced!
"
15,7,Randy,"I'm not dead yet Sharon, but you might be!
"
15,1,Jimmy,"Of course.
"
1,3,Cartman,"Shut up, I'm not scared of nothing.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Jesus, what have I ever done to you? Craig? Token?  Who, who else needs a partner?  Uh who else needs a partner?
"
12,10,Kyle,"God damn it!
"
7,13,Kyle,"So, tobacco helped to build America.
"
5,12,Kyle,"Yeah, dude.  Nobody does. They're too expensive.
"
6,3,Butters,"Well, gush, ah, I need to go. I can't picket, guys.
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"Hey... That's a terrific idea!
"
6,4,Butters,"Me neither.
"
12,9,Wendy,"As soon as that bell rings, we do it outside, you got that?! And you better be there.
"
3,13,Cartman,"I'm gonna be home-schooled, and leave all the pain and suffering of public school behind me! Screw you guys, I'm a-gonna be home-schooled! 
"
10,6,Kyle,"We know. 
"
12,6,Randy,"Ohhh.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Yeah. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ah I'm sorry, but I don't really care. I just want to know what medication my little has been getting from you, and why?!
"
5,8,Kyle,"Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! 
"
15,1,Kyle,"AAHH!
"
1,6,Cartman,"Ehh, eh, ehhhh! 
"
15,6,Butters,"Wahh!
"
16,11,Butters,"Whoa, it's like gasoline!
"
17,1,Cartman,"I do toooo!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Wow, dude! Your grandpa still isn't dead?
"
1,7,Wendy,"Yeahhh?
"
13,6,Randy,"Probably.
"
7,12,Cartman,"Awww, look at them. Aren't they so cute together?
"
11,7,Randy,"Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
"
18,1,Cartman,"It's not, dude! Some dumb court-thingy, and the trademark got pulled! You can use it! Aaand the logo!
"
4,14,Mr. Garrison,"Hello, parents, and welcome to the 13th annual South Park Thanksgiving Pageant.
"
8,8,Kenny,"(Giant Douche! Vote for him!)
"
8,4,Kyle,"Yeah! You got served!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
4,3,Stan,"Will you guys be in our Cirque du Celville?
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down.  Stanley, gay people... well- gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Naziesque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?
"
18,10,Kyle,"That's not what I was trending! They took my hash tag and they raped it! Where is Ike?!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Fuck you!
"
15,13,Kyle,"I guess we should all realize...  that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand. 
"
8,6,Cartman,"Mr. Jefferson, hello?!
"
10,3,Cartman,"It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
"
1,2,Wendy,"Stan, I can't do it alone. Please? 
"
16,2,Stan,"Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?
"
18,8,Wendy,"Yeah. You should show your support too sometime.
"
2,8,Kyle,"Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always.
"
6,1,Cartman,"So how long until we can joke about it?
"
5,12,Butters,"Yeah. And their own sprinkler system. You don't think you're rich? 
"
13,6,Stan,"Yeah?
"
18,6,Stan,"I didn't think I spent that much. I, I clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up.
"
9,6,Cartman,"I want my eternal bliss! Do you think this is funny, God?!  Do you think this is funny,..?
"
1,7,Stan,"Hey look, Kenny's not dead.
"
3,3,Stan,"Chef, but-
"
1,2,Kyle,"Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load.
"
10,13,Cartman,"Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself!  Come on, Butters, we're going!
"
14,9,Randy,"This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! 
"
10,9,Stan,"JESUS CHRIST!!
"
3,3,Kyle,"Yeah! You're a blood-thirsty succubus!
"
3,1,Kyle,"Hey!
"
9,8,Stan,"No. I broke the dam.
"
15,4,Randy,"Oh yeah, and fuck Kyle! Surgeon general's resignation, Obama's real birth certificate, moms to stop trippin', and fuck Kyle! You got that?! Or else we're gonna bring the Federal Express to a grinding halt!
"
14,4,Stan,"Alright, Dad, I'll add you!
"
17,2,Cartman,"Dude, do you know Aaron Hagen?
"
13,6,Randy,"Stan, did you use all the damned toilet paper agai-?  Aw crap!  What?! What do you guys want?! We said we only used what was in the kit! You got nothin' on us! You got nothin' on us!
"
8,8,Stan,"I'm voting.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Are you guys nuts?! After everything we've gone through!?
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Eeww.)
"
9,3,Stan,"Wing doesn't belong to us or to you. We're all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Uh oh.  Crap, they called the cops on us.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Halleluyah! Wash away the sin-eh!
"
10,1,Kyle,"CHEF! 
"
2,5,Cartman,"Come on, rice picker!
"
5,7,Wendy,"Stay away from me, Stan!
"
2,6,Stan,"Holy crap, dude.
"
16,9,Cartman,"Hmm.  I can't.  I can't seem to get into your bathroom, Kyle. 
"
9,13,Butters,"Shouldn't we get him back in the water?
"
9,1,Kyle,"Why? Why do I have to accept it when I can change it?
"
14,9,Cartman,"You ginger Jersey Jew!  Your tactics don't work on me!
"
10,8,Stan,"This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
"
1,8,Cartman,"Yeah, HEY!
"
9,2,Randy,"My son is in there! Duh-uh!  Stan?!  Stan! Stan!
"
8,9,Stan,"Dude, just let him come. The bus is about to leave. 
"
5,12,Kyle,"And Cartman for having a whore for a mom.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Kenny!!!
"
13,1,Kyle,"Yup, he's in here. 
"
4,10,Stan,"Nonono, I get it. Jesus wanted us to eat him, but he didn't want us to be cannibals, so he turned himself into crackers, and then told people to eat him.
"
12,7,Butters,"Huh uh.
"
18,5,Butters,"Comin' dad! 
"
3,4,Stan,"I don't know. He's such a wuss.
"
12,6,Stan,"Mom, I just gotta do a couple more things
"
7,12,Kyle,"What are they doing?
"
2,3,Stan,"Hey, what's this? 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Well, you know, with your wiener.  Just stay down here until you hear word from me. And... pray, Butters... pray for all mankind. 
"
6,17,Cartman,"The people of Iraq deserve a good Christmas just like everyone else.
"
4,6,Cartman,"YES I AM!! 
"
11,6,Kyle,"This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!
"
3,5,Cartman,"""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor...""
"
10,7,Cartman,"Time out?
"
7,5,Kyle,"See?! I just saw your lips move!
"
1,2,Stan,"Take that you stupid Indian! 
"
5,10,Butters,"Uh, my parents are makin' me wear this paper bag until I learn... to stop makin' silly faces all the time. They've really had it up to  here with me.
"
16,3,Stan,"Oh, that's a good idea.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Hey, Tammy!)
"
3,14,Stan,"Dad, Dad.  Mom wants you to come home.
"
10,12,Cartman,"Oh God...  Okay, how long now?
"
3,12,Cartman,"This is gonna be fun!
"
14,3,Cartman,"85 bucks?? I don't have that! 
"
16,9,Stan,"Well, dude, it's not like the bar is this actual, physical thing.
"
7,6,Butters,"Yes?
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"This is driving me crazy!! I can't handle you little bastards being so mellow!!
"
7,8,Cartman,"Yeah, and let's see Craig out gay us now.
"
4,16,Stan,"...Then it's ours. The whole town. It's ours.
"
2,9,Wendy,"Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Ow!
"
3,14,Stan,"No, you can't do that. Our dads are there.
"
12,11,Kyle,"Hey, hey, look at this. 
"
5,7,Butters,"But it won't stay on. I- I need a rubber band or somethin'.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Hehe heh, heh heh heh. Dude, HumancentiPad is awesome!
"
17,10,Butters,"Okay.
"
13,2,Cartman,"Hunh!
"
14,4,Randy,"Alright, fine.  Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?
"
11,13,Stan,"I know. I need you.  I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that...  ...with my best friend.
"
5,11,Randy,"Well... so... they don't really... do anything.
"
5,13,Stan,"Well WHAT, Cartman?
"
2,7,Kyle,"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
"
13,5,Jimmy,"You like putting fishsticks in your mouth?
"
8,6,Cartman,"Your name is Blanket... Right. Well Blanket, I'm Howdy Doody, and these are my friends, Timsy, Winky, and Nod. Unfortunately, we have to be off to the Land of Booger Trees, so we'll be leaving now. 
"
10,10,Cartman,"They what??
"
1,13,Cartman,"'S up, homies? 
"
13,4,Kyle,"Come on guys, we gotta go! 
"
15,9,Cartman,"That asshole is not getting across my border! 
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Excuse me, Funnybot. My name is Jimmy, and I'm a stand-up comic. You're putting a lot of good people out of work.
"
1,5,Cartman,"Well, looks like nobody's home.  Guess we should come back some other time.
"
18,1,Cartman,"By pledging just one or two dollars, you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff. If you pledge $10 or more, you will receive this luxurious company micro badge.
"
16,10,Cartman,"No, hear me out, you guys. Haven't you seen those ADT commercials? ""Women these days get raped by perfectly normal-looking white guys in broad daylight."" It may be too late for Kyle's mom, but I'm getting some God damned security!
"
5,11,Kyle,"Ah- I was just sledding, and the next thing I knew my sled rope got tangled with a bus, uh. I gut dragged for over a hundred miles before the bus finally stopped for gas.  I'm sorry about your sled, Kyle.
"
7,9,Cartman,"You know, Jesus? I've been thinking a lot about you lately and, well, that's why I wrote this song.
I love you, Jesus. I want you to walk with me
I'll take good care of you baby. Call you my baby, baby!
You died for my sins, and you know that I would die for you, right?
What's the matter, baby? You tremble at Jesus, baby!
Your love... is my life! You know when I’m without you, there's a black hole in my life! Oo-ohhh!
I wanna believe. It's all right, 'cause I get lonely in the night and it's up to you to
Save me! Jee...sus...bay-by!
"
6,8,Cartman,"Oh, it feels so good on my skin! Mmmm.
"
13,3,Stan,"What?!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Okay, why?
"
15,11,Randy,"Hey, really??
"
13,14,Kyle,"What the hell for?!
"
15,4,Cartman,"I'm still fucking angry!
"
4,6,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
2,11,Kenny,"(When you rub your dick,
you might find a discharge that
winds up on the floor.)
"
15,5,Kyle,"Ooogh. Dude, the thing is, we're not the ones that made them crack babies. That's their moms' goddamned fault!
"
8,2,Cartman,"All right, Mom, look. Here's .. the truth.  God, this is gonna be hard to say.  I think, Mom, that I've been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I've sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I'm starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn't be so cold. I just want a chance to change.  Help me change?
"
1,1,Stan,"Well, we can't do anything for now, that fat bitch won't let us.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Well, what?
"
3,2,Randy,"Or else what?
"
13,8,Stan,"Alright, let's see: demonic ghosts, animal ghosts...  ...setting traps for ghosts, no...
"
2,15,Stan,"Can you leave the light on, Dad?
"
2,4,Cartman,"Is that why it stinks so bad? 
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"Now, kids, this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list. 
"
4,7,Stan,"What Kyle really needs... is a new kidney.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Right, but... but I've learned that we can't judge people based on what they look like.
"
13,5,Butters,"Ohoho, there's Clyde. Do it to Clyde.
"
2,2,Cartman,"Just tell us already!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Whoa! They gave you an anal probe Cartman?
"
14,9,Cartman,"Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!
"
7,5,Cartman,"S'awright?
"
16,14,Kyle,"Look! There they are!
"
11,5,Randy,"Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!
"
8,6,Stan,"All right dude, get in his bed.
"
3,10,Cartman,"...But Mo-o-om, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool!
"
9,8,Cartman,"You know what I'm talkng about!
"
14,14,Stan,"Dad, what are you doing?
"
15,7,Stan,"I haven't changed, the world has. Don't you see it?
"
9,14,Randy,"This is taking too long! I'm gonna run out of beer! Stan!
"
2,12,Stan,"It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls. 
"
7,3,Kyle,"They did?
"
11,12,Cartman,"Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now.  So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Ogh! Okay, so now can I PLEASE get fired and get my 25 million dollars?!
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh, hey Dad.
"
5,7,Stan,"Why does that matter?
"
6,7,Stan,"Oh no, what now? 
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh, it's a double-cross!!
"
8,14,Kyle,"This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
"
7,7,Randy,"All right? Stan? Okay?
"
2,6,Kyle,"Dude, I can't believe they fell for it!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hey, come one guys! We can use part of my gift certificate to buy food at the food court.
"
11,5,Stan,"No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! 
"
6,4,Kyle,"What? 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Because I need to, all right?! I've got something planned that's uh gonna be really sweet. Just play along, okay?
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Orange.
"
14,4,Stan,"Dude! Fuck your crops! 
"
12,7,Butters,"Teacher, my partner is back on the bus! 
"
10,7,Cartman,"I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-
"
4,11,Kyle,"But what if we're wrong?
"
2,4,Kyle,"It's okay, Ike. I'm here.
"
6,8,Cartman,"What, that's not dumb. Think about it: food goes in the mouth, comes out the butt. Food goes in the butt, comes out the mouth. That's not dumb, that's genius.
"
6,10,Kyle,"Maybe she's in the lunch line.
"
12,8,Jimmy,"...You didn't see the new Indiana Jones movie?
"
1,5,Kyle,"How big do you think he is?
"
8,6,Kyle,"They're TV dinners. Don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat?
"
13,14,Kyle,"That is gross!!
"
5,10,Stan,"There's these two people with asses where their heads should be.
"
11,10,Cartman,"We had a deal, Kyle!
"
13,2,Cartman,"He's not a fag!
"
13,3,Stan,"Dad?!
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon?  Oh, whatever!
"
7,4,Randy,"And I'm a little bit rock-n-roll-AH! 
"
4,17,Kyle,"It's only three days until Christmas, you guys! You know how bad things have been around here. I think it might be because Mr. Hankey hasn't come.
"
12,9,Wendy,"I don't care! 
"
7,7,Randy,"They don't care. 
"
4,10,Kyle,"Hey, dudes. What are you doin'?
"
5,13,Cartman,"Alright, well, you gotta take over the telemarketing for a bit.
"
12,8,Cartman,"What the hell is wrong with you?! That is not cool, Butters! That is not cool!  You don't fucking do that! You don't shoot a guy in the dick!
"
16,3,Cartman,"And we'll have a blast doing the new stuff. 
"
7,15,Kyle,"Ike's not my little brother anymore?
"
9,6,Butters,"Kyle, Eric wants you to know that he's, he's sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking Jew.  He's asking for your forgiveness. And and he wants you to just remember the good times.
"
14,1,Butters,"It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
"
9,3,Kyle,"She had a contract with us first! We own her!
"
4,2,Kenny,"(You what?)
"
10,8,Stan,"Look! There he is!
"
3,10,Kyle,"...Power.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come? 
"
10,2,Butters,"I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.
"
17,7,Stan,"Did you ask the Vamp kids?
"
8,11,Cartman,"Huh. I don't have any ideas yet.
"
15,8,Cartman,"Did you guys know there's actually a disease called Assburgers? 
"
5,1,Kyle,"It's true. We think that word might be plaguing our friend, Kenny.
"
11,12,Cartman,"How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
"
5,9,Kyle,"Oh crap, it's him!
"
10,3,Cartman,"Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever.
"
2,7,Stan,"I think we have to signal them somehow.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Oh!  Phew.
"
2,8,Stan,"Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year.
"
1,4,Stan,"Sparky! Hiya Sparky, how's it goin'?
"
10,14,Stan,"Oh Jesus, can we just practice?
"
2,17,Stan,"Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.
"
17,2,Kyle,"Uh alright, sorry kid. Gue- guess we have the wrong house.
"
8,11,Kyle,"Twenty-two people?! All right!
"
11,4,Cartman,"LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
"
9,1,Cartman,"Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! You-hoo-hoo-hoo loh-ost! Hahahahahaaahaaa!  Kyle, I'm totally ripping on you at a totally inappropriate time.
"
13,4,Randy,"You face so many challenges to put an end to your grief.
"
5,3,Cartman,"What?
"
5,5,Kyle,"Oh my God!
"
3,8,Stan,"Awww!
"
12,4,Butters,"Me too!
"
6,6,Butters,"It is almost ...complete. The creation of my minions who will assist me in bringing terror to the world.  There we go.  Ye-ess, my minions of, of chaos.  Shhh. Night now, night now my lovelies. Your time to bring dest-struction will come very soon.  Aaahhh!
"
3,3,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, can we talk to you?
"
6,7,Cartman,"I've been up for hours doing some calculations, and I've come up with my final theory of composite dynamics.  Sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety.
"
13,10,Kyle,"What?
"
6,1,Butters,"Hoh boy! Mom and Dad didn't... find out I... left the house, did they?
"
1,3,Kyle,"Well Stan, you want to know what I think?
"
6,15,Cartman,"God-damnit that was a long flight! I thought we'd never get out of stinky-ass smelly Scotland!
"
8,9,Cartman,"You guys know what? Um, the last thing you do when you die, is crap your pants.
"
7,13,Kyle,"Throw 'em away!  Dudes, here he comes. Guys, stop coughing. 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brakes! Bye Kenny. 
"
6,16,Butters,"We are?
"
15,7,Randy,"No it doesn't sound like crap to me!  Ugh. 
"
16,2,Kyle,"What does that mean?
"
16,11,Cartman,"Dude, I'm telling you! Butters beat the crap out of Scott, and then he locked himself in the bathroom! 
"
5,5,Stan,"I don't think we're female groupies or random sluts.
"
17,7,Cartman,"The Federation has agreed to fight with us!  With them and the kindergartners, our army has just doubled in size!  You still think you can convince Stan to come back to our side, don't you, Sir Kyle?
"
2,2,Cartman,"Is he awake yet?
"
16,9,Kyle,"You don't need that! Get off of it.
"
7,15,Cartman,"No! No, this can't be happening! 
"
17,3,Cartman,"Get on the flight! Let's move! Let's go go go go!  Oh my God! 
"
12,6,Randy,"So is there Internet here?
"
5,8,Stan,"But we don't care!
"
1,9,Stan,"The whole town's pissed off at each other.  It's really sweet.
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ole Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang!
"
14,1,Stan,"Aw dude, I clocked you!
"
1,1,Stan,"Yeah, whatever, ya fat bitch.
"
1,12,Cartman,"I suppose your socks smell like the Botanical Gardens!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Alright, Kyle, listen.  Legends tell of a horrific four legged creature from Mexico that sucks the blood of goats, and it might have just spotted in South Park.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Brother Kyle? Why do you disturb my rest?
"
6,6,Stan,"Suckup.
"
13,6,Stan,"Dad, maybe we should just take out the thing you put in the car an-
"
4,17,Stan,"A-ah huh.
"
10,4,Cartman,"Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead.
"
16,6,Kyle,"AAAAAAAH! I can't take it! 
"
2,10,Stan,"Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"
4,10,Randy,"Oh, what the hell are they doing now?!
"
5,1,Kyle,"It's not new!! I'm gonna look ""shit"" up in the encyclopedia and prove it!!
"
6,2,Butters,"Let's dance. 
"
1,7,Cartman,"What?! What did you say?!
"
13,9,Butters,"What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up!  Do you know what I am saying?! 
"
15,13,Stan,"...What?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
"
4,1,Cartman,"When a man is stripped of his freedom, degraded in the ways that I was, it's-
"
2,15,Cartman,"Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions.  There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to. 
"
8,5,Butters,"Well yeah, we're havin' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore.
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"Nn-um. m'kay, uh, I've already taken care of it; Eric Cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention.
"
17,2,Randy,"No, I know, but it's like we're just good friends. A marriage has to be more than that! A marriage has to include fulfillment of fantasy and desire sometimes. Magma cube? What the hell is a magma cube?
"
17,6,Cartman,"Small penis?!
"
18,5,Butters,"Hey Eric, I'm just lookin' at a video of bird eggs that I took.
"
15,9,Kyle,"Yeah, you're a great Meheecan, Butters, just not a great leader of Meheeco. 
"
1,7,Cartman,"Hi Wendy.
"
13,8,Kyle,"Guys, Ike has gotten worse. I'm really worried about him. He says he's still seeing dead celebrities.
"
4,7,Stan,"Come on, Kyle. Let's get out of here. 
"
3,12,Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me fat!  Mom, don't laugh.
"
8,9,Stan,"We don't want your store in our town; we come to destroy you.
"
14,6,Randy,"Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?
"
13,13,Stan,"""Wendy Testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina. Whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break, Wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end""!
"
4,2,Stan,"Well?
"
17,9,Cartman,"Oho! Bill Gates! Sweet! In your face, Kyle!
"
11,14,Stan,"Yeah well, I guess a lot of things... change, don't they?  Bwaaaagh! Bwaaaagh! 
"
5,10,Cartman,"Uh oh. 
"
6,4,Cartman,"See? Maybe they want to become sweet juicy veal steaks.
"
1,7,Kyle,"It looks like a UFO.
"
6,14,Cartman,"Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a...  Pakistani.
"
3,1,Cartman,"I'm going this way!
"
14,4,Stan,"Okay it says I'm at your farm.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Hey, we didn't start the fire, Trent Boyett did.
"
14,2,Butters,"Huh?
"
2,18,Stan,"No problem, Gorak.
"
5,1,Cartman,"Detective Sandy Vagina here  thinks that ""shit"" might have something to do with everyone getting sick.
"
5,1,Stan,"Oh.
"
1,8,Cartman,"You vas-deferens!
"
11,10,Stan,"Dude, do you really have to do it?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Hold everything!  Mrs. Garrison, if you don't mind, I'll be taking that microphone..
"
9,7,Jimmy,"We're going to an authentic Italian restaurant, Buca de Fagghecini
"
16,10,Cartman,"Oh yeah yeah, my pass phrase is... Kyle is a dirty no-good Jew.  No wait, Kyle is a no-good lying Jew.
"
16,5,Cartman,"Boy you like my body. Set the mood, let's play!
You can touch me anywhere except for my vajayjay.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Ah, Mr. Garrison, I don't think that's quite fair, uh I mean, you rarely let us get up and leave during the class.
"
7,9,Kenny,"(Oh you forgot to get some Judas Priest.)
"
1,7,Mr. Garrison,"And the award for worst costume this year goes to... Stan, for his stupid little clown thing costume. Let's all point at Stan and laugh, children.  Yeah.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Dude, look! 
"
9,13,Kyle,"All right!!
"
10,8,Stan,"Ddue, we have to try.
"
15,7,Stan,"Jesus, how long before they start this Goddamned thing?! 
"
6,10,Wendy,"Ugh! God, you guys are sooo stupid! 
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Well, guess what, boys? I think that ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is just what you need. I'm gonna sign up all four of you.
"
3,6,Stan,"What?! Cartman, you call people names all the time!
"
12,9,Cartman,"God, you are such a pussy, Stan! You're such a pussy! When I hurt Wendy, it's gonna be on your fucking head! 
"
17,7,Jimmy,"C-C-Cartman's army is getting bigger every day. In addition to the Federation and the kindergartners, the XBox army now also has the kids who play Harry Potter, the jocks, the swim team, and the glee club.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Mm, succulent and juicy.  Can we have a free sample of these, too?
"
16,1,Stan,"They are trying to save Clyde's mom.
"
3,4,Kenny,"(I can't make love to you until we get a king-size bed!)
"
2,16,Cartman,"Who's we? You got a turd in your pocket? Hahahaha.
"
2,11,Stan,"Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Oh did they? Uh I hadn't heard about that.
"
3,8,Stan,"There are no more missions. I have everything I want. 
"
16,12,Stan,"We're rich?
"
16,3,Stan,"""Faith Hilling is pretty stale,"" said Republican candidate Newt Gingrich. ""If they had crashed the debate by Taylor Swifting that would have been impressive.""
"
6,6,Butters,"Please, fellas, uh don't fire me.
"
16,1,Randy,"Yeah yeah.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Dude, are you from Mars or something? Any ride you want. No lines.
"
6,9,Stan,"Members, this is our darkest hour. We've just learned that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg now intend to update and change Raiders of the Lost Ark.  There's only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed. Mr. Secretary? 
"
12,8,Cartman,"What day is American invasion again? I fohget. 
"
1,1,Stan,"That wasn't a dream Cartman, those were visitors!
"
18,3,Randy,"You know we're all cutting down on phone time.
"
2,9,Stan,"Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you.
"
6,12,Cartman,"...ticket stub?
"
7,6,Cartman,"Hey, this is our case! You can't come in and take over!
"
4,2,Cartman,"There is no money.
"
16,6,Kyle,"You sold us out?! For an iPod Nano?!
"
9,2,Cartman,"What did I do?!
"
11,11,Cartman,"DO IT!  Come on buddy.
"
4,13,Stan,"Can I do it?
"
4,16,Stan,"No. If they have it, one of ours will die for Carousel!
"
6,8,Randy,"No. It means we get to, son. It means... we get to. 
"
12,2,Cartman,"Yeah, but we totally don't.
"
3,1,Kyle,"What's the Yanogapa?
"
18,9,Randy,"You know, I think Lorde is going to play tomorrow.
"
6,1,Butters,"Four times, mom.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Like what?
"
13,10,Cartman,"We just received a letter from the WWE.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Dude, come on! We've gotta get out of here! 
"
2,7,Cartman,"Hmmm, let me see. No!
"
6,6,Cartman,"I'll do it.
"
4,4,Cartman,"I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(All right! Come on, let's get to the parking lot. Woo-hoo!) 
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Pssst. Hey, kid. Come over here.  Yeah, come on over. Ch-check this out. You looking to have some fun?
"
13,8,Kyle,"Mr. Jackson, please, you're causing a lot of problems.
"
9,11,Kyle,"We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I'll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Officer Barbrady, I would like to reinstate my previous Shenanigans! This whole carnival is a rip-off!
"
9,9,Cartman,"Okay. One! Two! 
"
6,3,Kyle,"This is terrible, dude! Maury Povich parades these poor people around on his show like carnival freaks! And then gives them prizes at the end after they joked about it. What a dick!
"
4,4,Cartman,"Please don't call on me. Please, Jesus, don't let him call on me.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Honestly, I wouldn't really care.
"
1,11,Kenny,"(Damn, I'd like to get a taste of her!)
"
6,2,Stan,"I dunno.
"
12,8,Stan,"Yeah well I, I just try not to think about it.
"
6,4,Stan,"Wait, what is that?  Dude!
"
3,2,Kyle,"You're such a fat baby!
"
3,3,Stan,"Let's find out where he's working and go see him there tomorrow.
"
1,12,Cartman,"Na-ah! She's being a total bitch!
"
11,3,Cartman,"Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
"
13,8,Kyle,"But of course it matters, because you should be concerned there's blood in your underwear.  Do you understand this?
"
5,2,Jimmy,"What's that?
"
8,5,Butters,"Okay Mom. Well, come on, AWESOM-O. Bedtime.
"
4,3,Kyle,"So if you're identical, does that mean you all think alike?
"
10,4,Kyle,"Do the right thing. Show Mohammad.  Do. The right. Thing.
"
17,1,Kyle,"That is not what happened! You totally started crying and quit the game!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(What?)
"
7,8,Stan,"Aw Jesus, Kyle, don't be such a whiny little gaywad! Come play catch with us. 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Well nice job, Marvin! I hope you got about a thousand dollars to pay for my house!
"
14,8,Butters,"Ahhh well oh- kay.
"
2,10,Stan,"They did?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Duhhh!
"
8,14,Stan,"It's dead.
"
6,3,Stan,"Doing all this to bring us back a prize. What a great friend! 
"
4,14,Cartman,"Kyle, can I talk to you over here for a second?  Kyle? Why do you do these things to me?
"
16,3,Cartman,"I was thinking of maybe Faith Hilling at the place they do AA meeting.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah, take that!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Token, how many times do we have to go through this? You're black. You can play bass.
"
10,9,Mr. Mackey,"When you dook in the urinal, it's bad, m'kay!  How would you feel... if somebody came into your home, m'kay, pulled down their pants and laid a big mud monkey right on your mom's face?  Oh you think that's funny, huh?! Yeah, that's real funny!
"
16,12,Stan,"Huh? Wha? ...Oh, oh hello? Who is that?
"
5,2,Timmy,"Uh, Timmih.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Have a seat, Eric. Now boys, I for one am sick and tired of this little feud you're having, okay? This has clearly gone too far, and you owe each other an apology or you're gettin' detention!
"
1,9,Kyle,"Friends? 
"
10,10,Cartman,"I am the Dawg, the big bad-  Oh my God!  What the fuck is this?!
"
3,13,Cartman,"C, H. ""Ch."" Chalk.
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean-
"
10,8,Kyle,"Boars?
"
6,9,Cartman,"Okay, Tweek, let me tell you something: You've been our new friend now for two weeks, okay? And I've gotta be honest with you, it isn't going well.
"
3,4,Stan,"Super. See you there. 
"
14,5,Cartman,"I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.
"
7,9,Cartman,"I think that's what the whole world needs, praise Christ.
"
17,2,Stan,"Look dude, we're trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows! This could be a matter of life and death!
"
10,2,Randy,"Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Cool.
"
2,11,Cartman,"I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.
"
12,11,Randy,"I got a... really good shot of it, Sharon. 
"
11,13,Kyle,"Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters.
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle!
"
1,11,Cartman,"Yeah, dude! My mom says all I have to do is chow on this box.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Oh, we will. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Lame!
"
14,4,Randy,"Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?
"
6,8,Cartman,"I went down to the bank and got Kyle's twenty-dollar bill turned into twenty single-dollar bills.
"
6,16,Butters,"You know, Professor Chaos, bringer of destruction and disorder!
"
5,1,Randy,"Hey, uh, Sam, did you hear the news?
"
7,6,Cartman,"All right, that does it! Cover me! I'm going slo-mo!  Wwwaaahhh!
"
3,12,Kyle,"Those things are stupid, Cartman. They just stick your hand in cold spaghetti and tell you it's intestines and stuff.
"
6,7,Butters,"Really? So I shouldn't care if I come up with an idea, and the Simpsons already did it. It... uh...doesn't... matter.  Everything is back to normal, a, I think... I think I can go back to tryin' to destroy the world again.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Ready? Go! 
"
13,3,Mr. Garrison,"Now please, please! 
"
5,14,Butters,"...Bennigan's.
You'll love all our... shenanigans.
Oh, nutsack  Oops.
&lt;/poem&gt;
"
9,3,Stan,"We have someone who's ready to go on TV right away!
"
1,3,Stan,"Cartman?
"
4,15,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
8,5,Butters,"Oh boy,  AWESOM-O! We're gonna have the best time ever! 
"
13,7,Butters,"What's ""port""?!
"
6,1,Butters,"Oh, no, no, no! I ain't gettin' married; my parents will ground me!
"
12,10,Kyle,"Craig, we have chosen you to join our Peruvian flute band!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Ugh... what?  What's going on?
"
9,9,Butters,"Oh. Uhm, you know. Girl places.
"
1,7,Cartman,"What is that?
"
2,6,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Where does that grill go?
"
16,11,Cartman,"Well. Apparently Kenny is Butters' best friend. You guys gonna make out, Kenny? 
"
5,9,Stan,"Yeah, go Broncos.
"
18,5,Cartman,"It'll work, Butters. If there's one thing we've learned, it's that drones can't resist Craig's mom. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?
"
5,8,Kyle,"What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.
"
5,7,Stan,"But Chef, when is the right age for us to start having sex?
"
15,9,Cartman,"Ugh yeah?! Well you all need to stay focused, Goddamnit!  If you let yourselves get distracted for even one minute, we're gonna be overrun with these jobless, no good-!
"
9,5,Stan,"Oh no. No, no, no!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit you guys.
"
11,3,Cartman,"Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Well I think you're being very mature about this, Eric. It was an overly generous move to give all the faculty those cupcakes. I wanna thank you. Mkay.
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Ohhhhhhh, m'kay.
"
13,14,Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys! I really thought I was the only non-minority on Earth! How many of our species survived?
"
6,12,Cartman,"Do you think?
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah.
"
2,3,Stan,"Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind.
"
15,10,Cartman,"YOU GUYS! Oh my God, you guys!  You're never gonna guess what!  Seriously you guys, guess what??
"
11,13,Randy,"Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh.
"
3,13,Stan,"Don't call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!
"
18,8,Cartman,"What do you think Kenny? Would that make you feel better? Huh? Come on, where's that smile? Where's that smile, Kenny? I think he's smiling you guys. 
"
17,2,Stan,"Butters, what happened?
"
8,3,Stan,"That wasn't a movie, that was a snuff film!
"
11,11,Stan,"Tell them to get away now!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Butters! Oh God, it was... It was horrible!
"
15,9,Cartman,"Cartman. Eric T. Cartman.
"
12,13,Stan,"But you didn't die?
"
12,4,Cartman,"God damn it, when are they going to air new Terrance and Phillip shows?!
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"I just act that way to get chicks, dumb ass. 
"
2,6,Stan,"You big piece of crap!
"
16,3,Stan,"Oh, come on. You guys need to realize that Faith Hilling is over, okay?  You can pretend all you want, but it's not coming back. 
"
17,1,Cartman,"That'd be what?
"
4,2,Kyle,"Dude, this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality.
"
3,15,Kyle,"I made you out of clay.
"
13,10,Butters,"Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
"
6,13,Stan,"Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
"
1,12,Cartman,"Well. First I kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me in the nuts as hard as you can, and we keep going back and forth until somebody falls. The last one standing gets the arrowhead.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Okay, Butters, I'm booting up the core competency now.  Edifice framework is online. Vital signs appear to be normal. Interim status?
"
6,4,Stan,"Round one is over. We made it. 
"
4,2,Cartman,"For one tooth.
"
15,9,Kyle,"Wugh, game on. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
2,14,Cartman,"What's a Chewbacca defense?
"
2,16,Kyle,"God, I hate the holiday season! 
"
18,2,Cartman,"Ogh! Noo, noo, you guys, guys, what what we said was-
"
8,6,Kyle,"Come on, Blanket. 
"
5,8,Stan,"Brake, Kenny, brake. 
"
11,13,Kyle,"Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here.  Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?
"
6,16,Butters,"I don't follow.
"
17,7,Cartman,"On our own, none. But if we plan, strategize, and fight together!  ...We can be the first people inside on Black Friday. And use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive.
"
4,1,Stan,"Token, you don't wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow, do you?
"
15,11,Randy,"I do respect you, bro!
"
12,12,Randy,"Wooo, change.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Where is the detonator!
"
18,1,Kyle,"What the heck is that? 
"
10,14,Kyle,"Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous.
"
8,14,Stan,"Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
"
9,8,Kyle,"Dude, we don't have time for your stupid jokes! We're gonna die!
"
1,12,Kyle,"No.
"
2,17,Stan,"Bad!
"
4,9,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, yeah, that makes me hot, m'kay? 
"
1,13,Stan,"Wow. We're sorry your mom's a whore, dude.
"
13,11,Stan,"Yeah. Hell yeah! Let's do it!
"
16,3,Kyle,"I really thought it was gonna last.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Dude, those people are pissed!
"
17,9,Kyle,"I have an idea.  I don't like it, but I think it's the only choice we have.
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh Jesus no.  They've come to boil me alive! Uh just like Lobster Boy! Ah, I've gotta get outta here!  Wait! I can't go anywhere. I'm grounded. Oh Christ, what a pickle! 
"
10,10,Cartman,"There's fear and darkness all around you
The criminals are on the run
No use in not having your hall pass
I'll take you to the principal 'cause I'm the Dawg
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg
The Hallway Monitor!
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well, sure I have! It's just... I was about 19 at the time, so it's been about 21 years... m'kay. Let's see, uh...  I'm pretty sure I took th-yeah I took the penis, and I bu- uh, what the hell did I do with that damned thing??
"
5,10,Cartman,"YES! YES!
"
3,4,Stan,"Okay, the time has finally come. 
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, kids, get ready to take your places.
"
15,12,Cartman,"What?! Who?!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Dude, did you hear what's happening?
"
7,14,Kyle,"God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!
"
4,3,Stan,"Okay, hold it, hold it. 
"
6,3,Cartman,"Uh, sure!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Get your ass to jail! 
"
17,2,Randy,"Yes Stan, these are based on real things. This is like news. It's informative. Parents like informative stuff.
"
3,8,Stan,"Wait a minute  Oh my God!  Dude! That's this house. They think our parents are the religious cult!
"
2,14,Kyle,"When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
3,1,Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah, take steps to protect it, blah blah blah.  We here this a million times back up in the States.
"
16,10,Randy,"Oh my God! 
"
1,8,Kyle,"Here you go turkeys! 
"
3,10,Kyle,"Thanks.
"
7,8,Kyle,"I didn't feel comfortable in that stuff, dude. I'm just being me.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Well, think about it.  The first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance. It's best we let Butters and Scott Malkinson go first. While they fight, we can simply slip on by.
"
2,6,Stan,"Dude, my uncle Jimbo was in Vietnam.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Yes.
"
5,6,Cartman,"'K, one park admission? That will be twenty-nine ninety five, sir.  Five cents is your change and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.
"
7,10,Cartman,"I'm not fat. I just have a sweet hockey body.
"
7,2,Kyle,"What?
"
9,9,Cartman,"Dude, they've bought it hook line and sinker.  This is going swimmingly. 
"
17,3,Cartman,"Totally fine? Then it hasn't happened yet. Oh my God, we still have time!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch!  You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness.
"
16,13,Kyle,"Because you kind of made it matter.
"
10,14,Stan,"Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
"
11,4,Cartman,"It's my balls! 
"
3,14,Cartman,"What the hell are you guys doing?!
"
3,2,Randy,"Uh, it's too complicated to explain over the phone. Girlfriend ==&gt; DEADBoyfriend ==&gt; DEAD Call a town meeting tomorrow.
"
13,13,Cartman,"- of the United States of America. OUR United States, not the one Wendy Testaburger would have, a socialist dunghole -
"
3,13,Butters,"Well, she sure is.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Oh don't put this all on Tooth Decay!  Let me tell you something, Dental Floss! You're not as good as you fuckin' think you are! You're already acting like you're a star and we haven't even opened yet! OPEN YOUR FUCKIN' EYES, DENTAL FLOSS! YOU'RE ABOUT TO BLOW YOUR SHOT!
"
15,7,Stan,"It's okay, Mom. I understand.
"
18,7,Butters,"Fellas, I'm not grounded anymore."
4,10,Cartman,"No, but I'm not finished yet. I took the sandwich that the priest was eating, took the piece of ham out of it, put it between my butt cheeks, and then put the sandwich back and watched him eat it. 
"
5,12,Cartman,"Not too expensive for Token's rich ass family, apparently. 
"
10,4,Cartman,"So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?
"
10,6,Stan,"Oh my God.  Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Why the hell does the FBI keep arresting all my friends? This has to be the work of Stan and Kyle! God, I hate those guys!
"
16,13,Stan,"Pff it's like, that's here  and...
"
2,12,Stan,"Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager.
"
8,8,Kyle,"You hate Butters.
"
10,8,Kyle,"Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Agh! You see guys, this is why you don't bring Jews along on the away team: they don't play along!
"
4,9,Randy,"They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car...
"
14,9,Kyle,"Why does it matter?!
"
3,1,Kyle,"No. That's the same branch again.
"
5,13,Stan,"Bad.
"
1,7,Kyle,"Aren't you hungry Kenny? 
"
16,5,Stan,"What the hell does that mean?
"
13,14,Butters,"Well yeah, seeing all that running water makes me always need to pee.
"
12,6,Randy,"What?!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Wha-? Uh oo  why do you want then back so much?
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"THE AIRLINE COMPANIES ARE LOSING MONEY BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN INCOMPETENCE AND THEIR OWN INEFFICIENCY!!
"
7,15,Kyle,"I'm sorry you guys, but there is something we can do. We can go to Canada and see the Prime Minister like I said. If we can change his mind before Christmas, then your parents won't have to give my family money.
"
17,2,Stan,"Whattaya mean?
"
2,10,Kyle,"Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo.  Well, here's Kenny's house.
"
6,3,Butters,"Aw, gee whiz, yih, yo, you promise my mom and dad won't find out?
"
16,9,Cartman,"I'm not fat, Kyle.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Dude, where in the world can Britney Spears go where nobody will bother her?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Oh, awesome!!  Excuse me, excuse me? Can I get to eat some of your-  Thank you. Thank you.  Oh, I've got to get to Black Bart's Cave!  Ah! Excuse me? Excuse me! Coming through to Black Bart's Cave!  Oh!  Oh, scary! Look, a skeleton!  Oh man, I'm so scared!  Oh! Oh! Oh, that was awesome! Oh! Oh! Cliff divers!  Come on! Come on, dive!  Dive, asshole!  Oh, awesome! That was cool, huh?  Whoa.  Sopapillas! Can I get some sopapillas please?!  Sweeet!  Oh! Booth! Puppet show! Puppet show! 
"
6,15,Stan,"Awesome!
"
10,12,Stan,"Dude, no way.
"
7,3,Cartman,"You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?
"
2,14,Stan,"No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
"
15,6,Butters,"Oh man, this is freaky. Like that movie Paranormal.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Mom? Mom...
"
8,7,Stan,"Mom, can we go try to see the people from the future? I have a bunch of questions I wanna ask 'em.
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"And that's exactly why you need to go!
"
18,7,Kyle,"Fuck you!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Oh my God, somebody shoot me in the head!
"
2,5,Stan,"No! I have to get it out!
"
1,11,Wendy,"Ms. Ellen. Can I talk to you?
"
10,7,Cartman,"Goddammit, I am not a dog!  Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken!  Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!
"
18,1,Stan,"What?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Get really psyched up, Butters!
"
4,17,Cartman,"Yeah! I'll be a Jew too.
"
6,14,Kyle,"We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef.
"
16,10,Randy,"This guy doesn't know when to quit!
"
17,2,Randy,"Puh, punching trees?
"
5,2,Timmy,"Hmph! 
"
4,7,Stan,"Dude, one of your friends is goin' tuh die! Don't you see how serious this is?!
"
18,2,Cartman,"What's the point? Everyone hates us at school and our party's gonna suck.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"...There's already a Crips?!
"
5,4,Kyle,"'Cause we hate him.
"
10,2,Stan,"Come on, everybody be people now
"
2,3,Stan,"Oh, never mind. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"All that hard work.
"
4,6,Kyle,"Dude! We're surrounded by perverts.
"
9,7,Mr. Mackey,"He's what... Oh, you do? R-right now, right now it is? M'kay, m'kay. Don't worry, Jimmy.  N'kay, uhhh, let's pick someone else. Um, Eric, why don't you come up here?
"
15,11,Randy,"Can I get a scotch and soda? 
"
18,7,Stan,"Okay, I'm back in Cartman's room.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
18,5,Kyle,"Are you happy now?!
"
7,4,Randy,"Can you believe those hick sons of bitches? Manipulating those kids to be on their side.
"
13,2,Stan,"Dude, I have a picture of Mysterion in my locker too.
"
6,11,Randy,"Don't worry, it'll still be fun for us. 
"
14,3,Randy,"Hey uh, what's up with the KFC?
"
10,11,Butters,"Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?
"
14,4,Stan,"I just wanna do my homework!
"
11,13,Stan,"Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!
"
5,13,Cartman,"I think I only need a hundred or so more aborted babies,  and I can finish up the kitchen.
"
4,16,Stan,"You got foolied, outlander! We're the only ones with a working phone. And if you had taken our book, then it's one of us who dies tonight at Carousel!
"
10,2,Stan,"Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly.
"
6,1,Cartman,"There you are, Butters!
"
6,17,Kyle,"Uhhh, how d- how do we start this thing?
"
4,13,Stan,"This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!
"
6,8,Cartman,"Ugh! Do you really think I'd be that deceitful, you guys?!  Ugh, goddammit you guys, this is so seriously. 
"
1,4,Stan,"He's not meaner than Sparky.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"What's that? Oh, and one medium lemonade, please.
"
7,15,Kyle,"We need to see the new Prime Minister.
"
3,17,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! We found it! We found it, you guys!
"
16,14,Kyle,"Then you have to tell us!
"
1,12,Kyle,"Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, take the stupid triangle!
"
3,16,Stan,"No you didn't!
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"I'm as gay as a gymnast on shore leave!
"
2,3,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Wendy, I have muscular dystrophy.
"
4,10,Stan,"Dude, if this guy's goin' to hell, who's gonna save us?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Wing? Here, Wing!
"
4,12,Timmy,"Timmaaay!
"
5,7,Stan,"Man, this condom's driving me crazy.
"
5,2,Stan,"Alright, let's set up.  Ah hi, we're here to collect signature in support to force the Scouts to accept gays?  Uh, hello, gays in Scouts?  Goddamnit! 
"
4,2,Kyle,"Probably?! Is Atlantis real??
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Hunh?)
"
4,16,Cartman,"Where is your husband?
"
2,8,Stan,"Man, it's hot out here.
"
9,8,Randy,"All right, come on, both of you! We've gotta pull together every warm piece of clothing we can find.
"
15,8,Cartman,"You are so lying! There's no disease called fuckin' Assburgers!
"
5,12,Stan,"Dude, we're gonna play football. Do you wanna play?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Dreidel dreidel dreidel,
I made you out of clay,
Dreidel dreidel dreidel--
"
4,3,Cartman,"You guys, come here.  This is totally awesome.
"
14,2,Cartman,"Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one.
"
1,12,Cartman,"I was just setting it aside.
"
1,11,Stan,"Did I what?
"
9,5,Cartman,"What?!
"
7,6,Stan,"We're on the case.
"
12,9,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, get your buns back over here, m'kay?!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Now we're talkin'! 
"
8,11,Jimmy,"B-b-bingo!
"
1,2,Stan,"What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.
"
18,9,Kyle,"What is happening to our living rooms? There is a crisis in America, and-
"
7,5,Cartman,"What? What?
"
8,6,Kyle,"Dude, what happened to your knee?
"
7,13,Kyle,"Cartman, you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow. But I'm warning you, those anti-smoking people are liars and they're bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want, and that means they're dangerous. 
"
7,9,Kenny,"(Yeah)
"
11,13,Kyle,"Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
"
7,10,Kyle,"They're saying something about taking over the entire country.
"
14,7,Butters,"He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. 
"
6,1,Stan,"You wouldn't be a penis-butt, Butters, you'd be famous. Just think about all those people following you around, singing songs to you just because you lost some weight... 
His name is Butters, it's Butters. 
"
7,4,Stan,"Uh, we didn't do it.
"
3,12,Kyle,"How exactly are we gonna use her to scare them?
"
1,12,Stan,"Isn't that your job?
"
2,5,Kyle,"We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.
"
6,16,Randy,"Uh... nothing. Go ahead.
"
16,12,Randy,"Chicken nuggets... and fries... sweet and sour sauce... and a Hi-C Orange. 
"
1,4,Stan,"My gay dog ran away, and I was wondering if maybe he came here.
"
5,6,Cartman,"No no! I'm buying it to keep people out!  Don't you see? Forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park, so that I could be alone in it, all day, every day. I love theme parks.  But the lines! Everywhere you go, people, crowds,  The rides are great, but...  All the lines, lines, LINES!  If there's one thing I hate,  all the lines, lines, lines, LINES!!  And then there get to be so many people  that they make FastPass.  So then there's lines for FastPass.  You stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later. Then there's lines for the bathrooms , lines for the drinks , lines for cantakuras  and rare Kartankulas Plinks!  ...And, so you see, this park is for me. Nobody else will be allowed in it.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Do you think I'm stupid?! I know that all Jews carry fake bags of gold around their necks to keep the real bags of gold around their necks safe! Hand over the real Jew gold, Kyle!!  No! Noooooo! 
"
4,7,Cartman,"I do! I do care! Look how much.  Look. Look how much I care. 
"
2,15,Cartman,"You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up.
"
10,2,Cartman,"Butters, are you there?!
"
5,1,Stan,"Yeah - no - I'd, it, it sounds really cool.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Oh God.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Cut the crap. You got the stuff?
"
16,6,Cartman,"A marina?
"
17,2,Stan,"What?
"
1,7,Cartman,"Lehh, eh, screw you guys!
"
7,5,Kyle,"That's not what I meant!
"
7,5,Kyle,"God dammit! 
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on! 
"
9,4,Stan,"Don't kill Kenny!
"
7,4,Stan,"Yeah.  War is not my voice.
"
13,9,Butters,"Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other.
"
3,9,Kyle,"It's what we do in Jew Scouts. Usually we just sit around and make stuff. But tonight, because there's a meteor shower, we're gonna do some big thing out in the woods. It's gonna suck ass, I'm sure.
"
6,9,Cartman,"Dude, that sign sucks! Nobody's gonna show up!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Aren't they cute, you guys?
"
9,4,Cartman,"I do have legal authority, your honor. You see, I was Kenny's... BFF.
"
3,13,Stan,"You shut up,  gaywad!
"
2,10,Cartman,"Hell no, you guys get your own!
"
3,8,Randy,"Good idea.
"
11,2,Cartman,"No, no, it was a stupid mistake!
"
2,8,Stan,"Right. 
"
13,14,Stan,"Dude, this is awesome.
"
12,9,Wendy,"Jesus Christ, do you have no sense of self-respect?!
"
5,3,Kyle,"What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
"
5,14,Cartman,"Huho!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now. You definitely have to have pretty thick skin or else these people, they just walk all over you.  Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of them. 
"
18,9,Kyle,"Google him. He's this guy from Sweden who has over 30 million YouTube subscribers. We didn't even know, but he's a bigger celebrity to kids than anyone. It just seems so lame.
"
7,14,Butters,"Yeah.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
10,10,Stan,"...Wow.
"
12,9,Wendy,"Get away from me! 
"
9,4,Stan,"Yeah!
"
15,7,Cartman,"No, Kyle's right. You suck, dude.
"
11,10,Cartman,"And there was a leprechaun! You saw it, Kyle!!
"
1,11,Stan,"Bluuch. Kick ass!
"
18,9,Kyle,"Yes! 
"
2,11,Kyle,"Yeah, all the constellations look alike.
"
8,10,Butters,"Oh my God, he's coming! Oh hamburgers he's gonna kill me!
"
3,3,Cartman,"Hey! Laser corrective surgery! Thanks Chef!
"
4,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uh young man, if you don't wanna be held back a grade, I suggest you start cooperating, m'kay?!
"
3,12,Kyle,"Yeah! Where's Grandma? 
"
4,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well that's easy. Write about what you know. Write about what you love. What do you love most?
"
17,2,Stan,"Wait... wait, you mean in Minecraft?
"
2,15,Kyle,"Well, at least he's back to normal.
"
7,7,Cartman,"All right, let's go! 
"
7,15,Stan,"Dude, Cartman.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Fuck youuuu, fuck youuuu. Fuck you up there! Fuck you! ""Fuck you."" Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently. There are a lot of startup companies on Kickstarter, but after today I think you'll agree that Washington Redskins is the most exciting. As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we've come up with.  To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn't stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today's times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you'll all agree is very exciting.  Now when people hear the name ""Redskins"", they will immediately think ""titties"" and ""balls"". It's just a bold new way that we can say ""We don't fucking care."" Go Redskins! 
"
2,12,Randy,"Whatever.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Guys! Guys, get outside! It's the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Hyeah Timmay!
"
7,9,Stan,"It is?? 
"
12,3,Kyle,"Kenny, all you did after the cat peed in your face was start running around in circles cheering.
"
3,1,Cartman,"I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Mother won't hear the truth!
"
13,8,Cartman,"Yes. Thanks to us and Chipotlaway, the spirits of the celebrities can now rest.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Okay. 
"
17,2,Stan,"No no,  just Ivy Network, A&E, Oxygen, and Oprah's network. All the ones with murder porn.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Do you guys remember what a cool friend Kenny was?  God.  He was always up for helpin' us out; man, he was the best friend ever.
"
12,3,Cartman,"Dude, that cat urine really fucked you up. You were seriously tripping balls.
"
3,2,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
11,2,Stan,"Aw man, I've got H O R S now. 
"
6,11,Kyle,"But, wait. Where's the other team? 
"
6,12,Randy,"That's the ...s-s-saddest thing I've ever heard.
"
11,13,Stan,"You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!
"
2,4,Stan,"Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude.
"
4,16,Kyle,"...You got Raging Pussies tickets??
"
15,4,Kyle,"You measured everyone's wiener except for yours.
"
1,5,Stan,"Sick!
"
2,13,Stan,"Hey, uh this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman.
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"Mmm. It does taste like s'mores.
"
16,14,Butters,"I can't! Don't you see?!  Don't make me swallow this! Wa-I'll do it
"
15,7,Randy,"Hey everybody. Wanna thank you all for coming tonight. My name's Steamy Ray Vaughn and here's a little bit of Rattlesnake.  A-1 2 3 4! I've got a fever but it's under control!  I said I've got a fever need to take it kind of slow  I've got a fever but it's out of control. Ga ga, ga ga, la ga ga ga. 
"
4,2,Cartman,"So, you've brought me 400 lbs. of teeth from China.
"
6,4,Stan,"No!
"
7,7,Randy,"Where did you get that kind of money??
"
9,11,Cartman,"So I'm gonna stay like this forever?
"
3,2,Stan,"Dude, you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body?
"
15,5,Cartman,"Kentucky Fried Chicken gravy.
"
18,3,Wendy,"Eric, there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all you're doing is-
"
11,14,Butters,"Whoopie! 
"
5,2,Stan,"That's a great idea!  Attention, ladies and gentlemen! Now, for your entertainment, stand-up comic, Jimmy!
"
17,8,Cartman,"Yeah, whatever. The little prick thinks he's Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him.  How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in Game of Thrones?
"
10,6,Cartman,"Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?
"
1,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey, come here. 
"
17,7,Cartman,"Ah yes, Paladin Butters, are you enjoying it?
"
2,17,Stan,"Dude, we can't work with this kid.
"
6,5,Kyle,"Well why not?!
"
16,12,Randy,"They'll come!  Sooner or later! They'll have to come!
"
5,2,Butters,"Boy, am I glad to see you guys! There's lots of kids here from other schools, and I don't know anybody.
"
6,4,Kyle,"It is?
"
11,14,Stan,"The list was a forgery, Kyle!
"
3,10,Stan,"Hey, fat ass.
"
2,10,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Hey. Hey, look over there, Stan. That Raisins girl is really cute, huh?  Why don't you say hi to her?  Excuse me? 
"
11,12,Kyle,"Stan? Stan?? 
"
6,14,Stan,"Tolerance camp?
"
3,12,Stan,"Of course it's cool! She's gonna be all rotted and scary!
"
6,6,Kyle,"Anything that'll impress us, Token.
"
15,9,Butters,"All my amigos are there, waitin' for me.
"
1,13,Kyle,"Yeah. He's almost as bad as that guy on Full House.
"
11,14,Kyle,"Oh God! I do?
"
9,4,Kenny,"(That I what?)
"
6,3,Cartman,"Hello, is this the Maury Povich show?  Yes, I'm calling because I saw your television program, and I also have balls hanging from my chin.  I'd like to come in and talk about my disorder and perhaps get a free trip to the largest putt-putt golf course in the world?
"
10,3,Kyle,"Ike!  This way!  Iiike! 
"
16,4,Kyle,"This is what God told us to do!
"
1,7,Stan,"Oh, then, what's Halloween about?
"
18,10,Kyle,"But it's gotta be perfect. We're trending well, but we need to attract more followers who want good old family values.
"
6,10,Stan,"Ah, hey, Bebe.
"
6,16,Butters,"Yeah. My future self has a bad kidney from all the drinkin' he did in high school.  I need to learn to behave myself!  Hey! Where are you going, Stan? 
"
14,7,Jimmy,"You too, Ne-n-Nathan.
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"So does anybody know  any non-Santa or non-Jesus Christmas songs.  Yes, Eric?
"
4,2,Stan,"CHEF!
"
15,10,Kenny,"(Oh fuck I'm gettin' out of here!) 
"
9,4,Cartman,"Everyone's moms are taking their kids after school! We're outsmarting everyone by getting to the store right when it opens! Let's go!
"
15,14,Cartman,"IT'S NOT FUNNY, MOM!! 
"
9,14,Cartman,"I'm doing some sweet bun-sow moves.  I'm a little better than everyone else here.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Nuh uh.
"
8,5,Butters,"Hey there have you heard about my robot friend?
He's metal and small and doesn't judge me at all.
He's a cyber, wired bundle of joy.
My robot friend.
I like to dip and daddle with my robot friend.
He's smart as can be and emotion-free
And he's computed his way to my heart.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot... friend.
"
3,12,Kyle,"No Grandma??
"
3,1,Kyle,"Um, no.
"
4,2,Cartman,"How?
"
9,14,Stan,"I think you're pushing it.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Aw, crap! I must've rigged the wrong light!
"
3,8,Butters,"Uh let me handle this, Stan.  Uh now l-listen up and listen good, everyone! Why, I'm awful disappointed in you drinkin' and carryin' on this way! Why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves! Uh if you don't get outside right now, and tell those army guys you're not religious fantastics, there's, why there's gonna be heck to pay. Uh, heck, I tell ya! 
"
5,5,Stan,"He'll do it, dude.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?
"
6,4,Butters,"But they-ah they're angry at me.
"
1,1,Kenny,"(It's a giant stick that goes inside the mom's vagina) 
"
4,3,Kyle,"How long does this thing last?
"
6,1,Cartman,"He used to be fat but not no more 
"
3,4,Cartman,"No, no! Craig, you you can't fight him here; Mr. Adler would just break it up. Tell you what: I'll go tell him you accept his challenge, and set it up for after school today.
"
9,12,Cartman,"Hey, I know! Let's go play laser tag at FunPlex.
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh God! Oh Jesus! 
"
7,12,Randy,"Well you can't believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly.  Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! 
"
7,15,Stan,"You guys, I don't think we're in America anymore. 
"
2,8,Kyle,"Kenny! Watch out! 
"
13,12,Kyle,"Sounds good.
"
3,12,Stan,"What's the problem?
"
18,8,Cartman,"Huh? A little bit?
"
18,6,Cartman,"The?!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Mom! The babysitter has her boyfriend over!
"
6,4,Stan,"Yeah, well killing little helpless baby cows should be a crime, too!  How does this thing work, Cartman?
"
17,9,Kyle,"Look, the truth is, we all have a bigger problem now, and you know it. Nobody is going to get anything if we don't work together against those thousands of other shoppers.
"
4,14,Kyle,"Dude, don't forget: Timmy is the only kid who can play Helen Keller. Don't piss him off.
"
14,2,Mr. Garrison,"...and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate.
"
11,13,Randy,"NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!
"
6,16,Randy,"Stan, whatever's happened, we going to help you.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Ewww-hoohooo.
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, very nice, Clyde. Uh, Token, why don't you read your paper?
"
15,7,Randy,"Tween Wave?
"
18,8,Stan,"Wait a minute. I've got it, you guys.
"
3,15,Cartman,"that's why they're lame. 
"
8,8,Randy,"Now your vote didn't matter.
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"NO, no,  but Mr. Hat is. 
"
13,1,Kyle,"Dow... 
"
8,7,Stan,"No, a double cheeseburger and fries!
"
3,15,Stan,"I'll try again.
"
1,7,Cartman,"Ohh, heh- wow, you look pretty cool. 
"
6,17,Kyle,"On Skippy, on Rainbow, on Patches, on Montel. 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
"
1,5,Cartman,"You're not using any of Fluffy's blood, or else I'll kick you in the nuts.  Kyle, Kyle no! 
"
8,6,Stan,"No! Mr. Jefferson, you need to take your son home.
"
8,3,Cartman,"What kind of atmosphere are you reading on the planet surface, Jew?
"
3,17,Kyle,"Eewww.
"
5,5,Stan,"I'm sure they'll be here any minute.
"
8,10,Stan,"Start one. Then we're gonna put it out.
"
8,11,Kyle,"What if we do a show where we-  Uh, no.
"
3,2,Randy,"Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Dude! Dude! DUDE!  The fuck are you doing?!
"
10,10,Cartman,"There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!
"
16,12,Randy,"Waaarg! Look at the people watching movies on their Xbox. Haarrrr!
"
1,2,Cartman,"Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame.
"
8,6,Kyle,"Dude, we have got to get that kid away from him!
"
8,3,Kyle,"No, no, no! Don't become an angry mob!  The last time we did that we killed Jesus!
"
11,9,Randy,"I'll try, but I don't think-  wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"""If you're gonna be that way, I don't need to be your friend."" Wow, how insightful.
"
1,5,Kyle,"It's just a stupid pig.
"
5,5,Kyle,"See? I told you it would work. 
"
5,11,Kyle,"Now what?
"
1,11,Stan,"Oh.
"
6,13,Cartman,"You're acting like a bunch of assholes!
"
5,13,Butters,"Oh, it's all sticky. 
"
1,10,Stan,"Hey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?
"
7,13,Kyle,"Yeah. This is really their fault.
"
4,7,Stan,"You mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesn't fight cavities?
"
4,14,Kyle,"Can we take a lunch break now?
"
14,7,Jimmy,"I'm gonna try to make that Tardicaca gally mine, gally mine.'Cause all the while I'm dreaming of her. My Tardicaca Hola Gal!
Oh sorry, that's not right. Hang on. '
"
12,14,Butters,"Get back! For real, stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you!  Hwaaaahh!
"
6,14,Stan,"We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Come on. Come on!
"
17,2,Randy,"No, no, you're right, Sharon. We don't need informative murder porn to find passion in our marriage. We just have to get the spark back. Let's go away somewhere, me and you! Somewhere exciting and beautiful where we can just focus on us.
"
12,10,Cartman,"So?
"
16,10,Randy,"Whoawhoa, wait, wait. What do you mean?
"
1,5,Kyle,"We got Cartman's pig so we can splice its genes with my elephant's.
"
16,8,Randy,"... This is cum. 
"
3,2,Randy,"No! Has she been doing anything odd?
"
3,8,Stan,"No! Mom, please! They're the geekiest kids at our school!
"
18,10,Randy,"Mr. Jackson, it's me, Lorde.
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, weren't you watching?
"
16,9,Cartman,"Yeah... Yeah, here you go. 
"
12,13,Butters,"Hey, you fellas wanna go see High School Musical 3 tonight? Bunch of kids from school are gonna see it again.
"
16,8,Stan,"You don't suck at football, Butters, you suck at all sports.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Shut up, Craig! This is very difficult! You guys win, alright?! We'll all play on PlayStation 4s! We still think XBox is the superior machine, but you got too many people on your side, and then Kenny became a Japanese princess.
"
14,5,Stan,"Ooooooo...
"
1,2,Cartman,"Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?
"
1,5,Kyle,"How does that make the world better?
"
1,8,Stan,"You know, I think I've learned something today. It's really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.  But they are. That's why it's easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.
"
1,7,Stan,"Whoa, dude!
"
13,6,Randy,"It's, uh it's nothing, really.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Aaaaaa aaaaaa ooagh!
"
8,8,Kyle,"Kenny, we have got to make Stan understand the importance of voting, because he'll definitely vote for our guy.
"
1,4,Cartman,"Eh. You're making me sick, dude.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Alright Stan, just sit down at the computer. 
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, here's everybody. 
"
18,8,Cartman,"Yeah we like hardcore stuff, we're fuckin' dudes, bro.
"
12,8,Butters,"We're busted! Uh what do we do??
"
13,7,Butters,"Me and Ike, well, we've been talkin' and, well guys, we really had it pretty good back in America. I mean, sure, it's easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules, but a lot of people have it way worse. The pirate's life isn't a life of fun and adventure, it's a life of hardship and suffering. When you get down to it, well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Aaaaa!  Yes!
"
8,3,Stan,"He wouldn't give us our money back for The Passion, so we kinda took it.
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"You... you're right.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Tell her, tell her that I wish... I wish I would have been a better son sometimes!
"
2,12,Stan,"Dare. 
"
11,11,Cartman,"No! Hold on a second!  I have a contract  validated by the United States court system!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Ugh... what... where...
"
3,14,Stan,"Dude, my mom is sooo pissed at my dad for going to Kansas.
"
13,14,Jimmy,"What what's that? 
"
2,13,Cartman,"I only have three dollars left, asshole!
"
3,12,Cartman,"We could shove a stick up her ass and use her like a puppet: ""Rowr, rowr, I'm scary Grandma!""
"
4,9,Kyle,"...How?
"
15,7,Stan,"Dude, you totally lied to me!
"
2,8,Stan,"A summer without fireworks is like… I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass.
"
4,10,Kyle,"Nothing. But the guys said if I don't confess my sins and eat crackers, I'm gonna go to hell.
"
3,1,Stan,"I'm just a-scared of snakes.
"
3,5,Cartman,"I'm serious now!  Look. Over by those bushes.
"
12,9,Butters,"Jeez, I can't believe Wendy's gonna fight you after school.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Yeah, I know dude. I'm telling you, it was the worst pain in my entire life.
"
8,1,Stan,"Butters!
"
8,14,Kyle,"Oh, stop it, Cartman! 
"
13,13,Butters,"What did the Smurfs ever do to you! Ya bitch! I just called the president a bitch.
"
5,1,Kyle,"We're all saying the S-word too much! 
"
2,3,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, shut up! 
"
3,3,Kyle,"Chef should be here any minute.
"
3,12,Stan,"Dude, not cool. This is scary. 
"
9,10,Kyle,"What did we do?
"
4,7,Butters,"Well, Clyde was gonna come too, but he, he said his mom was makin' tacos for dinner and Clyde likes tacos a whole lot.
"
8,2,Kyle,"Yeah, that'd be cool.
"
15,11,Stan,"Hey wait, Dad, are you guys really going away? What about us?
"
8,8,Butters,"It's Mooey! Mooey, wave to me! Wave to me, Mooey!
"
16,8,Butters,"Thanks, Dad.
"
10,9,Kyle,"Hey!  Dude. You're alive?  Come back here! 
"
13,5,Cartman,"But, I'm sure I helped come up with the joke. Didn't I?
"
15,12,Butters,"Sir, we believe your fitness system is flawed, and that for 99% of us, it is unfair.
"
16,10,Randy,"Yeah, you too, Thad.  Hey Sharon, these came for you.
"
14,5,Randy,"Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it's just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We're just gonna need one thing.
"
16,6,Stan,"...Kenny? Kenny! 
"
9,10,Kyle,"Hang on! Wait! 
"
4,6,Cartman,"Yes. I'd like to join your fine organization. Is that cool?
"
3,9,Kyle,"Wow, cool.
"
15,7,Randy,"I'm sick of everything I do being so wrong, Sharon!
"
1,1,Wendy,"What happened to your little brother?
"
3,12,Kyle,"Wait till you guys see my costume! It's gonna be sweet!
"
2,6,Stan,"Yeah, what a couple of dumb-asses.
"
16,4,Kyle,"Would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth!
"
12,10,Randy,"There's Sharon and Shelly. They're watching some television. Wave to the camera, Shelly.  What are you watching, guys?
"
8,3,Stan,"We don't want to torture you.
"
8,8,Kyle,"Woah... wait, what are you doing?
"
15,10,Kenny,"(What?)
"
16,4,Cartman,"Well, I guess that's it. You're going to have to only allow me into the Easter Egg hunt, sir. I'm the only one qualified.
"
15,1,Kyle,"Hey! You can't do that! 
"
16,3,Stan,"Oh Long Johnson. Oh Long Johnson.
"
12,4,Stan,"It's Tron Guy. I saw him on YouToob.
"
14,8,Butters,"How bad is it, doctor?
"
2,8,Kyle,"How is that gonna help?
"
14,14,Randy,"I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!
"
8,5,Butters,"Don't be silly, AWESOM-O. Robots don't need to drink nothin'.  Uh, heehee.  Whoa. Uh, go answer the door, AWESOM-O.
"
8,5,Butters,"You... you're my robot?
"
16,4,Kyle,"Happy Passover, Cartman. 
"
4,8,Kyle,"Okay. since my dad's a lawyer, he says we can use any of his books we want.  Who wants to read them? 
"
1,12,Cartman,"Boooriing. 
"
1,8,Stan,"Yeah, yeah, we do!
"
7,8,Cartman,"What? Tell us?
"
2,17,Kyle,"You bastards. Listen, we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"He never did, Mom, not once.
"
7,7,Butters,"Oh... 
"
3,6,Jimmy,"See?
"
13,14,Kyle,"Not in pee!
"
11,10,Stan,"Cool.
"
3,6,Stan,"You see, Cartman? You see what this has done?
"
1,6,Stan,"Hey, what are you doing?! 
"
18,1,Cartman,"Sittin' on our asses, here we come!
"
1,5,Kyle,"Dammit! This is never gonna work.
"
1,13,Kyle,"Mr. Mackey, something's really wrong with Cartman.
"
13,9,Kyle,"Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special.
"
1,6,Stan,"'Cause, I'll get in trouble.
"
1,10,Cartman,"Eeyy! Uh-turn him back you butthole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!
"
1,7,Kyle,"No way dude. I'm gonna win the costume contest with this sweet Chewbacca costume.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih, Timmh.
"
7,1,Stan,"Dude, I have no idea what we're seeing right now, but I have a feeling it's really, really wrong. 
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"What? What on earth are you askin' me that for?!
"
11,4,Kyle,"Wuh what doesn't follow?
"
16,12,Stan,"Just let me go! We're nobody! We didn't see anything! I pro-I promise!
"
1,7,Kyle,"Costumes and candy.
"
9,14,Randy,"Okay, no problem. Easy.
"
5,1,Cartman,"No, come on! Guess! They're gonna say something that's never been said on television.
"
8,4,Randy,"But I know I can't stop you from doing it. So all I can say is... give 'em hell, son. Give 'em hell. 
"
5,13,Stan,"No! This can't happen! Kenny can't die! Kenny can't die!! 
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, uh we're from South Park, Colorado?
"
2,16,Cartman,"Why does Grandma have to live so far away? Why don't we just stick her in a nursing home closer to us so  I don't have to drive six hours to get a god-damned present?!
"
10,2,Cartman,"I'm not doin' it for Kyle.  I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. 
"
9,5,Kyle,"There he is! Now, don't let him know we think he's a loser, or else he won't play. 
"
16,4,Butters,"Oh, hamburgers.
"
9,6,Butters,"He he got caught, he got caught up in the rat race of, of taking things for granted.
"
16,10,Kyle,"Oh no...
"
9,5,Randy,"...I'm not gonna go. 
"
16,14,Cartman,"Here's another patriotic American. He probably spent hours listening to all those presidential ads and tuned in to every debate. 
"
4,8,Wendy,"Cartman, why don't you just go home?! You aren't helping any!
"
8,1,Stan,"He's really old and going blind.
"
11,14,Kyle,"No way.
"
7,9,Butters,"Fuck you, Eric. 
"
6,10,Kyle,"Yeah. She's really cool. 
"
5,14,Butters,"Sir? Hello?
"
9,8,Kyle,"What are you doing?
"
11,1,Cartman,"Ohhhhhhhh?
"
8,11,Stan,"Token! Now, come on, guys! We worked too hard to just roll over for Craig and his stupid overall deal. Instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to figure out how to make our show better!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Nono, Jeh-
"
4,13,Stan,"Cartman!
"
3,15,Cartman,"It's sooo amazing!  You spin this thing on the ground and it goes 'round and 'round. I could watch it aaall day!
"
16,12,Randy,"No! No I won't do it! Leave him out of this! He's just a little boy!  Hey Stan. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"What?
"
1,3,Cartman,"Danforth, pull up flank! Look out for Charlies- up in the trees!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Well, he is not listening to my authoritah!
"
16,8,Butters,"Okay Dad!  Oh! Saaave that, for later. 
"
1,6,Kyle,"Well, yeah, but what if the grampa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?
"
7,14,Stan,"Huh? But you just got dumped
"
6,17,Stan,"Wuh, that smells. 
"
8,3,Stan,"We'll take the bus! Look, this isn't about the eighteen dollars ticket money anymore. This is about being able to hold bad filmmakers responsible!  This is just like when we got our money back for BASEketball!
"
18,9,Stan,"Oh, is that right?! Do you even know how to multiply?!
"
15,9,Cartman,"Ey! Just because I'm Texan doesn't mean I'm fat!
"
18,1,Butters,"One dollar pledge!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Oh! God damnit!
"
3,2,Randy,"Yes, yes, of course. I've got work to do.  What?!
"
7,11,Butters,"Who's coming this way?
"
3,13,Kyle,"""Krocsyldiphic.""
"
7,15,Cartman,"This is it, Kyle. You and me. We're throwin' down. Right now.
"
9,3,Kenny,"(All right!)
"
5,8,Kyle,"Thanks, Towelie.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Yes, yes, hello? Is this Mr. Su-gi-yama with the Japanese space program?  How much to take a whale into space?  Nu-no, we don't want you to eat the whale, we want you to send it to the moon. How much? Jesus Christ! Uh hang on.  Hello? Jimmy, any luck at the Chinese Embassy?
"
1,7,Stan,"I said, ""I can't wait to own a fishing tank.""
"
12,10,Kenny,"(Well I don't know.) 
"
9,11,Stan,"I think we're at the Sunset Room at the Airport Hilton.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn't exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh,  anyhow  And then as I got older my... my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same. That's how I got my nickname in college. 
"
2,5,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, Nurse Gollum is absolutely qualified to be a--
"
8,11,Butters,"Gee whiz. We sure worked hard on that new show.
"
7,6,Cartman,"A bunch of fat old skanks on their periods?
"
16,11,Butters,"And that's another thing! You're always trivializing everything I say by gettin' the last word! Well you're not gettin' the last word this time! 
"
1,7,Kyle,"No it's not cool!
"
9,12,Mr. Mackey,"Well, that sounds pretty reasonable, m'kay. 
"
18,3,Cartman,"Because I don't want a chick watching me go poo!
"
5,13,Cartman,"Yes, I'm making a delivery of these fetuses hyah?
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
"
7,11,Cartman,"According to my calculations, that meteor is going to hit Earth in less than four hours.
"
10,1,Kyle,"He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Uh, Chef?
"
3,5,Cartman,"Stop, you guys! I can't think!
"
11,14,Cartman,"Yes way! Check it out! 
"
4,8,Wendy,"The-  the- uh,  aheh ahum,  the… the- uh,  Ahhhhh,  The first argument we-  ah…  Let me start over.  The uh-  oh God. Could you all excuse me for a moment?  Mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee...
"
5,2,Stan,"We did it! We did it!
"
16,2,Kyle,"Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
"
2,18,Cartman,"I'm gonna go jam my thumb in some'in's butthole now.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Don't try to talk, Peter Panda! You're gonna be okay!
"
4,14,Timmy,"Haaaaa!
"
6,10,Randy,"Ohhh boy. Looks like he's starting to notice breasts.
"
5,5,Stan,"When are they gonna make new ones?
"
7,1,Stan,"Dude, sweet! 
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"Yes, thank you!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh, man, look at that one!  It looks delicious
"
7,15,Cartman,"HA! Yeah, right! Like our parents aren't gonna buy us presents for Christmas!
"
5,9,Stan,"Hello. We need to go...  here. 
"
11,2,Kyle,"Let go of me.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Mmmath homework, Mmmath homework. Where did I file that?
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"Ogh! You're such a racist bastard, Mr. Hat.
"
15,11,Randy,"What?
"
1,9,Wendy,"Okay
"
6,17,Cartman,"Hi guys!  Very Merry Christmas. God bless one, everyone! 
"
4,3,Randy,"I don't know.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Really??
"
2,9,Cartman,"Aw, man, smells like ass down here.
"
4,11,Stan,"Dude, that seems kind of... weird.
"
8,9,Randy,"It's beautiful!
"
5,6,Cartman,"Yyeessss! Yyeessss!  Awesome!  Ho ho!  Sweet!  Yes!  Folks, please keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times, make sure your seat belts are fastened, and enjoy the Mine Shaft!  Yes!  Yes!  Oh, cool!  Oh, look how much fun I had!  Whoa! Heheheheh.  Ah! Heheh.  Whoa! Heh, heheh.  Woooo, Adventure Island! Check it out! Awesome!  Yoohoo! Yeh-hehess!  Yehess!  I'm so happy! I'm so happy..!
"
11,10,Stan,"Butters.
"
5,8,Stan,"Fine.
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, now I wanna review the different sexual positions. Who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about?
"
9,3,Stan,"Token sings?
"
15,13,Cartman,"You guys, we are wasting time. If we have to write a report on Thanksgiving let's just go downstairs and watch TV.
"
6,5,Cartman,"I don't think we're watchin' them on this TV.
"
4,9,Cartman,"That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
"
1,10,Kyle,"Bad.
"
7,1,Kyle,"What a dick!
"
7,6,Butters,"Well I'm tryin', but nothin's comin' out.
"
6,9,Cartman,"But just remember that I do all the talking.
"
8,5,Cartman,"I'm not a robot, I'm a human!
"
9,11,Jimmy,"Yeah, beat it, j... jackass. 
"
8,13,Cartman,"Eugh... 
"
10,12,Cartman,"Butters, get your coat. We gotta go.
"
2,17,Cartman,"I believe in the family-owned enterprise.
"
18,10,Randy,"Me! Oh right, I forgot to tell you that part. I'm actually Lorde.
"
1,3,Cartman,"Eeeh!  
"
11,11,Stan,"Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation.
"
7,12,Stan,"Mr. Harrison said that I should be followng Heavenly Father's plan, and I don't even know what that is.
"
10,1,Stan,"Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!
"
14,14,Stan,"Aw crap. 
"
11,6,Cartman,"You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Stay- stay back! Nobody moves, you got that?!  Don't... touch us! We know what the Chinese are up to! We saw the Olympic Opening Ceremonies!  The gig is up! Everyone just s-step over to that wall!  I mean it! Butters, hold this gun on them. 
"
2,10,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, don't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too.
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"Very nice, Clyde. Okay, we have time for one more report before recess. Who'd like to go?  Okay Eric. 
"
7,15,Kyle,"Why not?
"
18,1,Kyle,"What?!
"
9,14,Cartman,"Dude, what the hell is he doing?
"
10,4,Cartman,"Family Guy is written by manatees?  Of course, it all makes sense now.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Yeah, what are we supposed to do?
"
15,4,Cartman,"Oh God. Why couldn't I have just taken a minute to think about it?
"
8,6,Stan,"Ah, actually, Mr. Jefferson, we were seeing if Blanket wanted to chop wood with us.
"
6,10,Stan,"Ahta! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!
"
7,11,Jimmy,"Well, sure, Eric. W-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-prrroblem?
"
1,6,Cartman,"Why don't we just shoot him?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Yeah. 
"
8,6,Kenny,"Nonono wait, I'm not Blanket!
"
18,10,Randy,"No! That was a copy of me!
"
12,8,Butters,"Lu lu lu I've got some space flight. Lu lu lu space flights seem old... Lu lu lu-
"
17,10,Wendy,"Something that should have been done a long time ago! 
"
9,6,Stan,"But Mom, we've been waiting for hours!
"
7,5,Cartman,"You want to sign Ms. Lopez?
"
2,9,Kyle,"Well?
"
15,12,Kyle,"Yeah, but dude, he seriously could have died in that fire.
"
6,10,Cartman,"And we're really sad to see you go. Let's give a big round of applause for Kyle, everybody. Hip hip.
"
2,16,Stan,"Dude, they're gonna kill me.
"
13,6,Randy,"Sshh! I've been filing down this piece of metal into a shank. I'm gonna call him over here to look at the car, and when I do, you shove that in his neck.
"
13,9,Butters,"Wha? Awww.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Yea. It is nice to see you, Sister, but I must prepare for my next sermon. 
"
15,6,Butters,"Oh, come on!
"
14,14,Randy,"I wasn't watching food channels!
"
7,4,Kyle,"Cartman, you are hereby declared a full-fledged retard!
"
1,9,Mr. Mackey,"Right now you're nuttier than Chinese chicken salad, mkay-I mean, you're one screwed-up little kid do you understand?
"
7,11,Butters,"What?? 
"
9,9,Cartman,"Now Butters, we don't know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties. But if they start, you know, lezzing out, just roll with it.
"
8,3,Kenny,"(Me too!) 
"
16,2,Cartman,"You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!
"
3,6,Kyle,"Dad, if the school has to pay you and Cartman $1.3 million, where does that money come from?
"
17,9,Randy,"WHAT?? STAN'S IN THE RED ROBIN WEDDING TOO?? OH GOD, I REALLY CARE ABOUT HIM!
"
3,12,Cartman,"Oh, no! This is my Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!
"
4,9,Stan,"Aw, come on, dude. Let her try.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Yeah, but you're our new friend and that makes you cul.. p-piable!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Who did this to you?!
"
7,12,Cartman,"Hi. My name's Eura. Eura Fag.
"
12,6,Randy,"Excuse me, I need to uh, have some private Internet time.
"
14,10,Stan,"Is something wrong, Wendy? 
"
2,15,Cartman,"Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!
"
3,6,Cartman,"You have... sexually harassed me for the last time! It says right here... that now I can sue you and take all of your money.
"
10,6,Cartman,"It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!
"
2,16,Stan,"We thought you were in jail.
"
8,9,Cartman,"Yeah, when you die, your jowels release and crap comes flying out your ass. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"There we go.  Come and get it.  ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it.  Come on, good pony. That's it!  Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony!  Oh no, pony, he'll like that.
"
7,12,Stan,"Un, I don't think so, Gary. I have to uh... 
"
11,8,Cartman,"You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?
"
1,9,Kyle,"It's true.  He doesn't care what faith you are.
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo
he loves me and I love you
Therefore, vicariously he loves you
Even if-
"
12,10,Cartman,"Shut up already!
"
4,1,Kyle,"Don't fart on your way out; you might make little smoke signals. 
"
9,5,Randy,"Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter batteruuuuuuuupp batterbatterbatterbatter!
"
16,1,Stan,"Wow, really?!
"
14,2,Kyle,"No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters.
"
10,13,Cartman,"Mom! Mom, they did it!
"
18,8,Kyle,"Aw I don't think he wants to play, dude.
"
15,7,Stan,"Ugh.
"
12,3,Stan,"I'm sure glad that's over with. 
"
2,4,Kyle,"I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner.
"
9,8,Randy,"My son is counting on me!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Mom, look! The tooth fairy! I put a tooth under my pillow, and she gave me two dollars!  She's only given me a lousy quarter before!
"
9,12,Stan,"Dad! Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Uh bonus?
"
5,5,Stan,"Two thousand dollars.
"
7,4,Kyle,"But it's not fair! We have to do a full report on the Founding Fathers, and Cartman got out of helping us again!
"
10,10,Kyle,"I think so.
"
16,2,Cartman,"What d'ja say?
"
9,12,Stan,"I took out the garbage yesterday.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Butters, do you wanna go to jail for the rest of your life?!
"
18,7,Kyle,"Www-what do you mean?
"
3,13,Cartman,"I am studying, Mom. I'm learning with the Fonics Monkey. 
"
14,2,Stan,"Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
"
1,7,Wendy,"Let's go trick-or-treats.
"
13,3,Stan,"Yeah, I wanna return this Margaritaville my stupid dad bought.
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh but it must have been a real short movie, though, because Dad came out, like, ten minutes later. ...And it must have been a sad film, too, because, he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out. Poor old Dad, the movie really got to him.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Cartman, I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to believe me, even if it seems impossible.
"
5,3,Cartman,"That co- ugh.  That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning.
"
11,11,Kyle,"Ah I guess.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Dude, you said you wouldn't say everything looked like shit!
"
11,2,Cartman,"What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life.
"
16,2,Stan,"So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it.
"
9,12,Stan,"Jesus Christ...
"
1,4,Kyle,"Hut, hut. 
"
6,12,Cartman,"Because Jews don't believe in heaven!
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Let's see... No, not there)  (Let's see. Nothing there)  (Let's see... here!) 
"
2,15,Stan,"Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-.
"
16,8,Cartman,"Butters, you understand this game better than anybody.
"
12,10,Randy,"Oh look! Stan's eating a tater-tot! Wave to the camera, Stan. 
"
2,15,Stan,"Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.
"
7,6,Butters,"...ow... Ow... It's not workin'
"
4,1,Cartman,"Hey you guys.
"
17,9,Butters,"Yeah, and if you believe that I've got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face!
"
18,1,Kyle,"Guys, we need to talk to you. I really don't think we wanna be a company that ISIS looks up to. We should maybe issue a statement saying that we don't sanction them.
"
11,7,Randy,"Help! Help us!
"
9,9,Stan,"What?
"
15,11,Randy,"She's WHAT?!
"
7,1,Kyle,"Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
"
1,8,Kyle,"I don't know. Do you know where he is, Marvin? 
"
18,10,Cartman,"Uh, everyone, tweet now if you wanna get rid of PewDiePie!
"
16,9,Kyle,"You have got to be kidding me!
"
6,3,Kyle,"Why the hell would they want that anyway?  Episode I sucked balls.
"
6,5,Kyle,"That's bull-crap! TV shows are gay!
"
14,2,Butters,"What?
"
14,14,Randy,"Aw yeah, look at that.
"
2,9,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig?
"
9,9,Cartman,"Nice.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Aw- Aw- AWESOM-O is coming. 
"
3,14,Cartman,"Good morning, gentlemen.
"
10,3,Stan,"Dad, this is stupid.
"
2,9,Kyle,"I told you guys he'd be here!
"
1,9,Stan,"Yeah.
"
15,2,Stan,"Whoa whoa whoa wait, w-what do you mean you're going to destroy all life on earth?
"
2,12,Cartman,"Herr Kommandant Cartman has ways of making you talk! 
"
8,3,Stan,"Hey, don't take that tone with me, kid! I'll kick your ass!
"
4,16,Kyle,"What I understand is that you totally screwed me over!! So why should I have to listen to you?!
"
16,5,Kyle,"Okay. Just be careful you don't end up naked and jacking it in San Diego. 
"
8,10,Stan,"Now it's five years later. And Trent Boyett is being released.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Okay, so how do we get my little brother back?
"
2,10,Kyle,"You get away from me, you crazy woman! 
"
6,16,Stan,"Yeah.
"
6,14,Cartman,"Ey!
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
"
15,13,Kyle,"How is that gonna help?!
"
5,3,Cartman,"Who's this asshole?
"
17,6,Kyle,"You're a fat skank, Mom, and your tits belong in a morgue. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Oh my God, this is sooo cute.
"
3,11,Cartman,"No, never. It's perfect.
"
1,11,Cartman,"That's not what we just heard!
"
2,14,Kyle,"Yeah, dude.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Cartman?
"
7,1,Kyle,"Dude, we have to try!
"
15,13,Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, let's all take our seats.  As you all know, Thanksgiving is only two weeks away. And so the school has arranged for a lecture from a real live Native American.
"
16,2,Stan,"Yeah dude, you can test them.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Hello, Kyle. Going somewhere?
"
4,10,Stan,"...Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
10,10,Kyle,"Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot.
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Okay)
"
17,6,Stan,"Yes, there's something that you all need to know. The truth about the red cow. We have all been  So- sorry, hang on.  Hello?
"
10,9,Cartman,"Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?
"
11,12,Butters,"Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!
"
8,4,Stan,"God dammit!
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes.
"
15,8,Cartman,"What are you talking about?? I got vaccinated from the school, and now clearly I have Assburgers!
"
3,3,Cartman,"Aaah! It's the succubus! 
"
4,9,Kyle,"We made two dollars.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Well, there is the nice French café downtown. Maybe we should get some Faith Hilling pictures there.
"
13,10,Kyle,"Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Well, that's nice, 'cause you can't go.
"
9,3,Stan,"You guys, you guys!
"
2,10,Stan,"My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"Right now.
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"Well, just make something up, like Eric did.
"
2,7,Wendy,"But Mr. Garrison!
"
7,5,Kenny,"(Heheehee, heheh yeahah)
"
7,7,Randy,"Oh hell yeah! Let it ride!
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Yes.
"
12,9,Jimmy,"As soon as the bell rings, we've gotta get out there and find a good place to watch the fi-fufu-fight. 
"
2,16,Cartman,"Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?
"
14,8,Butters,"You seemed really stupid, Eric.
"
18,10,Stan,"He does it all with computers and processors... He got discovered on the Internet. He's like the PewDiePie of music. And he played live last week. Rubbed his clit and started trending more than ever. I thought he had learned his lesson... but it's like he doesn't care.
"
3,8,Stan,"Can you hit a target, Pip?
"
2,8,Kyle,"We're bored.
"
1,4,Cartman,"Eeyy!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Yeah, well, Dad's being a little pussy, Mom.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Oh, Grey's Anatomy. Cool! Oh man, this is a great DVD. We're gonna have the ... sex, yeah.)
"
3,5,Cartman,"Well, what does that have to do with me being all the way out...? Wait a minute. You're distracting me! That game show is a fix! 
"
8,12,Wendy,"I think young women are being marketed to by corrupt, moral-less corporations.
"
2,14,Stan,"Yeah, dude, it's all yours.
"
13,4,Randy,"Oh my God, did you just...? At the table?
"
11,13,Butters,"They're gonna do it!
"
17,3,Cartman,"If we don't get to Florida there's not going to be a Baltimore left!  Black guy in the back!  Alight, now let's find Zimmerman.
"
11,3,Cartman,"Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?
"
6,16,Butters,"How about this? Winter Farm. It looks kinda nice.
"
1,7,Kyle,"I'm the whole solar system! The planets even all revolve the right way. That tub of candy is as good as mine!
"
4,7,Stan,"Dude, you really are sick, huh?
"
3,6,Stan,"An ass-sucker. It means you suck ass. You see an ass, you suck it. You're an ass-sucker.
"
12,10,Cartman,"Craig, dude, how're you doing, bro?
"
17,8,Cartman,"Well go ahead! Call the fuckin' cops then!
"
15,6,Butters,"Uh, no, he's pretty much just a truck driver.
"
13,9,Butters,"Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
"
4,13,Stan,"Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. 
"
3,14,Stan,"Ready? 1-2-3-4. 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Oh, no!
"
2,12,Stan,"We're building a clubhouse.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Where the hell is he?
"
12,7,Cartman,"Eh, you wanna hold hands with a girl? Gaywad!  All right, let's be partners, Kyle.
"
3,3,Stan,"Oh no! No nononononono!
"
14,5,Stan,"Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.
"
3,13,Mr. Garrison,"Hokay, children, we have a new student joining us from home school. Now, his parents are very worried about his safety, so please don't be too cruel to him. Mark? 
"
17,8,Cartman,"Forward, men!  That, no-  No, you- You've gotta turn me. 
"
14,14,Stan,"Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Oh sure!
"
4,1,Stan,"Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren't the same.
"
7,4,Stan,"Okay, so Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, then the Continental Congress-
"
6,6,Kyle,"Phew.
"
2,4,Stan,"What do ya mean?
"
13,11,Cartman,"That's not what we said.
"
12,7,Cartman,"If we sneak back inside, we can say we never left, all right?  All right, now let go of my hand.
"
13,7,Kyle,"No, I'm being totally serious. That is the best idea you've ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu. You should go there right away. I'll even help pay for your ticket.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Oh my God! Jenny Simons crapped her pants!  Did you hear that?!  It's WAY worse than Pete Melman was!
"
3,4,Stan,"Hey Tweek.
"
1,13,Stan,"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
3,13,Kyle,"Rebecca, don't you ever... look at the town? At that...  flicker of light over there?
"
7,14,Stan,"There is darkness all around me
Deep, piercing black, I cannot breathe
My heart has been raped.
"
1,4,Kyle,"Come on dude, we have to get to practice.
"
6,12,Cartman,"You guys we've got to focus! We've got to focus, and remember. 
"
18,7,Cartman,"I know it's hard to grasp, Kyle, but I was the one sent by customer service to try and convince you that none of what you've seen is real. You bought the Oculus Rift headset, Kyle.
"
2,8,Kyle,"Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?
"
2,8,Kyle,"Oo bastards! 
"
5,13,Mr. Mackey,"We know, and that's why he's going to need you boys to be strong for him, m'kay? He needs you now more than ever.
"
3,5,Kyle,"We just have to show you this new species because you're the Department of Interior guy now. Soon, they'll all be eaten by bears.
"
3,10,Stan,"Can you see anything? 
"
13,7,Cartman,"Me and my crew are gonna go on piratin' forever! 
"
12,1,Cartman,"All right, get that rope ready to hoist me up. 
"
10,13,Cartman,"Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Yeah. Trent's just lucky he didn't mess with us. I woulda kicked his ass.
"
5,3,Kyle,"Then I guess... I'm a dumbass. 
"
6,5,Cartman,"Clyde, Clyde? Did you see that?  Yeah, we- Whoa, we think it's gonna be good, too.
"
4,17,Stan,"(voice rising) Dude, Jewish people don't celebrate Christmas!
"
18,1,Kyle,"Whattaya say, Cartman?
"
1,9,Kyle,"No.  But I get Channukah presents for eight days.
"
2,10,Randy,"Stan, our son?
"
18,2,Cartman,"You know, we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time.
"
11,5,Kyle,"...Jesus?
"
9,2,Randy,"Stan?! Stan?! I need to get through, please! 
"
4,6,Cartman,"Oh, no big deal. I just found a group called NAMBLA with adult members, and they all think that I'm sure mature they want me to be their new poster child is all.  It looks like I'm finally gonna have mature friends who I can relate to. Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! I'm too mature for you guys! Nyanyanyanyah nyah nyah! 
"
16,4,Cartman,"That's right. There's a resort near there called 'The Atlantis Hotel and Casino'. They have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank.
"
3,10,Randy,"Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves.
"
4,17,Stan,"Kickass!
"
15,2,Stan,"Can we go now?
"
9,8,Cartman,"Hey! Wait up, you assholes! God! 
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I'm gonna piss in their face.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Hey, that's not fair! I got the fucking ticket!)  (Hey! What the heck!)
"
11,4,Cartman,"Yes, Mr. Thompson?
"
11,4,Cartman,"Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?
"
9,2,Kyle,"Yeah, so, where are they. Let's go get 'em.
"
10,14,Stan,"I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
"
8,9,Kyle,"All right, fine. Come on, fatass! 
"
10,10,Kyle,"Yeah. She's having sex with a boy. 
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews.. ...play stupid games
Jews... that's why they're lame.
"
5,2,Cartman,"Cripple fight! 
"
9,5,Stan,"Aw spit! 
"
6,3,Stan,"Where's you get the balls from?
"
2,15,Stan,"MMOOMM!
"
18,10,Cartman,"G'dang g'dang! G'dang g'dang g'dank!
"
7,10,Randy,"In here! 
"
6,17,Cartman,"Wow, look, you guys! We're riding in Santa's sleigh!
"
13,6,Randy,"Will you just give us a minute?! Gau!!
"
12,8,Butters,"Stay calm, Eric.
"
12,3,Stan,"Yeah, and where is he gonna find cats anyway? They've been outlawed.
"
7,6,Stan,"Did so!
"
16,3,Stan,"That's a cool idea
"
6,7,Mr. Garrison,"That is very impressive, Eric. What do you intend to do with your underwater society?
"
3,8,Stan,"Yes.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Yeah, fatass, this is their famous Mechanic sketch.
"
9,14,Stan,"Aww, it's all warm!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Dude! That is Craig's mom's bush right there! Wait, wait what's that?  Oh shit, dude! Bail! Bail! 
"
5,7,Cartman,"Just put it on, Butters.
"
12,1,Kyle,"Will you stop it with that?! What part of this is funny to you?!
"
18,2,Mr. Mackey,"See, that's probably the gluten talkin', uhkay? If you cut out gluten, you don't ever get pissed off.
"
11,7,Randy,"Oh Glen! We made it!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Hey, where the hell are you going?? 
"
10,6,Stan,"Pass it to me, Cartman?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Yes, it's really the best Christian album that's ever been produced, actually..
"
1,13,Mr. Garrison,"Yes! For God's sake, get on with it!
"
4,11,Stan,"Let's go. 
"
7,6,Stan,"We got it.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Hey! I'm doing it to save little baby cows. I'm not gonna stop eating meat altogether.
"
11,8,Cartman,"What's your problem, kid?!
"
17,6,Kyle,"You're a fat skank, Mom. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"No you don't!
"
8,7,Randy,"All right, good. Now, let's all go eat some of Mrs. Gruhd's great future cooking.
"
1,8,Wendy,"Many would rather die than go to those places!
"
17,9,Randy,"Now listen up: there are only eight of us now. Peterson was a great guy, and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!  When those doors open, we all stick together! If anyone panics, it puts us all at risk!  Stay tough, rookie.
"
8,2,Kyle,"It says right there ""a parent has to be with you to sign up,"" and you'll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! 
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah, dude, our parents are gonna be at the stupid fair all day long. They'll never know what we bought.  I'll get the tonfas.  Those are so sweet.
"
3,8,Stan,"No.
"
9,9,Butters,"Can I have something to eat? Well, I'm pretty hungry.
"
2,10,Randy,"I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.
"
11,1,Cartman,"Hahaha, no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. 
"
16,12,Cartman,"Yeah, he looks totally fine, except that when we walk up to a house, people are gonna be like, ""Oh wow, it's the Avengers, and some Captain FaceTime skateboard guy!"" 
"
11,10,Kyle,"I don't care if I signed an agreement!
"
10,4,Kyle,"If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is.
"
1,13,Cartman,"I was just down in the SPC kickin' it with some G's on the Westsa-eed-eh.
"
2,17,Cartman,"This guy sucks ass!
"
5,1,Kyle,"Goddamnit, Cartman! What are they gonna say on Cop Drama?
"
4,13,Stan,"Cool!
"
13,7,Cartman,"Somaliaaan piiiraaates weeeeee.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Yes!
"
7,1,Cartman,"It's that guy you want! He's trying to reverse your polarities!
"
5,12,Cartman,"Stand by, please.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Mom?! I lost my Mooohhm!
"
6,6,Butters,"Simple, my dear general. We are going to tear down the Earth's precious atmosphere! Oh yes! My latest plan will melt the polar ice caps, a-and burn all the world with the, with the... hu- sun's harmful rays!  Say goodbye to your... precious ozone and hello to chaos!  Okay, hand me another one, General Disarray. 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?
"
7,11,Kyle,"Oh yeah?! Well you're a stupid Jew! You're a Jew! Shut your God-damned Jew mouth! Good job, Jew! Jew... Shut up, Jew! You're Jewish!! Dude, he's Jewish! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew! Jew?! ""I told you Jewish people don't have rhythm."" ""Fuck off, Cartman!""
"
5,1,Stan,"Sh!
"
11,13,Stan,"Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. 
"
11,5,Randy,"Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them.
"
17,3,Cartman,"But it wasn't me, it wasn't my fault!
"
8,12,Wendy,"Mr. Slave, you're the most perverted, lewd, depraved slut I know.
"
11,7,Randy,"No. No, damn it!  That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Really?!)
"
4,14,Timmy,"Timmih?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(What about her?)
"
5,2,Cartman,"But you have to come back. We hate our new scout leader.
"
2,16,Stan,"But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!
"
7,3,Stan,"We'd better go over our story again so we don't screw it up.
"
3,10,Stan,"The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
"
6,4,Kyle,"They got us a truck, and an airplane, and Mr. Worf! The calves are gonna be okay!
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Rrrh!)
"
2,13,Stan,"Kenny, you go find Cartman. We have to go sign him up for the bull ride.
"
3,13,Randy,"Uh, look, Mr....
"
7,15,Kyle,"Hey! We're in Canada!
"
9,1,Kyle,"Mom! Dad! I have awesome news! The doctor who gave Mr. Garrison his sex change said he can make me tall and black. 
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, it just so happens we are going on a field trip tomorrow!
"
2,6,Stan,"During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!
"
13,10,Kyle,"Wrestling is awesome!
"
18,6,Stan,"That's not a glass, that's a trophy, that you won, for drinking.
"
6,1,Cartman,"A- AIDS?
"
4,2,Stan,"We're not dealing drugs!
"
3,8,Butters,"Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain't gonna stop until we're all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families.
"
12,2,Kyle,"It's gotta be the Komfort Inn. It's the nicest hotel in South Park. Cartman, go get your camera.
"
3,3,Stan,"Normally we go to Chef with our problems, but wuh we can't this time.
"
16,3,Kyle,"I-It's good that it became something else.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Dude! We're not digging up my grandma; I'll get in trouble.
"
7,9,Stan,"No, dude, it's cool. Kenny says you can download music for free on the Internet!
"
7,2,Timmy,"Oh, Timmih. 
"
3,13,Stan,"Well, get your ass out of bed!  We have to go deal with that home-school kid!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Wow, what a great audience.  Well, just in case you were wondering, I do have a disability. I am totally happy with the way I was born, very much. I travel to different states and talk to kids about being proud of what they are. My mom says that God has a p-plan for everyone. I guess I was plan B.  You guys like im- personations? 
"
4,6,Stan,"We got invited too, fatass!
"
13,9,Cartman,"Dude, we've created a monster.
"
16,12,Butters,"Come on! What are you guys goin' as?
"
11,4,Cartman,"The Russians?
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
16,5,Stan,"Butters is totally fine with it, dude.
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah, Kenny, you have to sing better!
"
12,12,Stan,"No, everyone is out partying in the streets. What's wrong with your brother?
"
9,13,Kyle,"Stan? 
"
14,3,Cartman,"Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!
"
2,8,Kyle,"Let's go, dude. We're ready.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Nothing. All right, guys, stand over there and look wholesome and cool. I have a timer on this thing so I can get in the shot too. 
"
12,3,Butters,"Mm-my cousin's in Florida, and said kids in their school get high off of cat pee.
"
2,17,Stan,"Yeess, this stuff rocks!
"
2,4,Stan,"You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine.
"
2,17,Stan,"Great. A lot of help you are, kid.
"
10,9,Kyle,"It's not my fault.
"
6,1,Cartman,"No, but they're due home any minute. Come on, you're just in time!
"
4,12,Cartman,"Who the hell cares?!
"
14,6,Cartman,"Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?
"
3,4,Stan,"Mr. Adler! Mr. Ad-ler!
"
13,13,Stan,"Wendy, did you see the stuff Cartman is saying about you now?
"
11,4,Kyle,"Baahir Hakeem.  Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?
"
6,16,Stan,"No, we gotta run away somewhere warm.
"
6,2,Randy,"All right, look, we've been here for over three hours
"
5,7,Wendy,"I didn't mean that-
"
2,12,Kyle,"Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip.
"
7,4,Randy,"Uh, boys, would you mind clearing the living room. We have to practice our big war protest song.
"
7,6,Stan,"I wasn't. We started playing Detective because we wanted our play time to mean something. Or have you forgotten why you joined the force, Kyle?
"
16,3,Kyle,"Go Cartman! 
"
12,10,Stan,"Over two hundred bucks.
"
5,14,Stan,"Butters was missing?
"
3,12,Stan,"We could never make one that looks real enough.  To be really scary, it would have to be real.
"
6,13,Kyle,"Jimmy, are you sure?
"
6,10,Stan,"Yeah.  Where are you guys going?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters?? Butters?? 
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Huh?) 
"
14,3,Cartman,"WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
"
11,7,Cartman,"I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
"
12,9,Wendy,"Will somebody do something? Every week he gets worse and nobody does anything!
"
16,14,Stan,"Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?
"
4,2,Kyle,"Four dollars?
"
4,15,Stan,"Did you like the old one?
"
4,2,Stan,"Who's the Boss?
"
3,16,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
12,9,Butters,"That's what I said. I told everyone outside, ""Cartman ain't scared of fightin' Wendy! He'd do it if he could!""
"
18,2,Randy,"Yes?
"
10,4,Kyle,"No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!
"
17,7,Cartman,"We have word from the kindergartners. They've agreed to join us! 
"
4,17,Kyle,"What?
"
9,5,Kyle,"You guys are so good you'll probably go all the way to win the national title!
"
13,6,Randy,"Awhuh. 
"
3,8,Kyle,"Dude! I'm glad to see you. You would not believe the night I had.
"
14,10,Stan,"Well no, don't throw that out.
"
4,2,Stan,"So all we have to do is go to a really rich kid's house, put our tooth under his pillow, wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money, and then sneak back in and take it!
"
6,1,Mr. Mackey,"I knew it would be funny someday!  AIDS!
"
7,12,Cartman,"Uh, that's cool. We're gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. The three of us have to go put in some volunteer work at the homeless shelter. 
"
8,11,Stan,"I don't believe it.
"
3,15,Kyle,"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
3,14,Cartman,"Where did the Confederates go, son?
"
3,15,Kyle,"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
15,9,Butters,"AAAH!
"
2,18,Stan,"Yup.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
4,10,Cartman,"Yeah. I'll see ya later, mom. 
"
10,9,Kyle,"What? No no no.
"
12,6,Randy,"I don't know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can't. 
"
18,3,Cartman,"I don't wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it! It's gonna be all crowded. 
"
13,6,Randy,"...Uh. That's r-. That's right!  Oh, oh my God! Hey everybody, we just made first contact!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Listen to me carefully, Butters. The Oculus Compromise has been streamlined. You can't trust anyone in this reality. Say nothing to no one about the Oculus Rift. If you think they know, they will kill you.
"
10,2,Kyle,"Dad, can we go home, please?
"
12,5,Cartman,"All right, uh, everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the Patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal; I'll be right back.  Melita! Melita, hold on.  You can't quit now. Come on, what's wrong with you?
"
9,9,Stan,"Yeah, us too.
"
7,3,Stan,"Butters. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Jesus Christ. 
"
14,14,Randy,"Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and hierloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche.  Aw yeah... Awwww...
"
5,9,Cartman,"It didn't smell that bad; you guys are overreacting.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Why? Aren't you happy here?
"
4,6,Cartman,"God-damnit, poor people suck! Your family is already on welfare, and now they're gonna bring another kid into the world. Poor people are turning out babies, adding to the overpopulation, and they're expecting me to pay for it with my tax dollars.
"
10,8,Kyle,"You bastard! 
"
8,3,Kyle,"Kill Jesus! Yesss! Arrrgh! 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
"
14,5,Randy,"You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!
"
11,8,Kyle,"You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!
"
16,10,Kyle,"I-Ike, this is a big deal. You have to be absolutely, 100%-
"
16,8,Butters,"Yeah, but I uh, I I can't be team captain. I... Well I suck at everything.
"
4,12,Cartman,"Touché, teacher. Touché.
"
14,14,Kyle,"He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay.
"
12,5,Cartman,"How do I reach these keeds?  All right, let's go get you an abortion.
"
1,3,Kyle,"I don't know where Cartman is. I think something took him away.
"
12,4,Kyle,"We'd have to put something up on the Internet that everyone would find fascinating.
"
10,6,Cartman,"Meh, meuh urgh.  Mbeuh.
"
17,6,Kyle,"I know Cartman made it all up, okay?! I also know that nothing is more important for humanity than peace in the Middle East! I'm okay with this, Stan!
"
12,3,Cartman,"Kenny! Kenny, wake up!  Wake up, Kenny! You all right? Kenny!
"
8,5,Butters,"Well, sure, but my robot is bringin' them in.
"
11,6,Kyle,"What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
"
17,5,Kyle,"It always has been. See? This is nice. 
"
6,4,Butters,"Hey fellas!
"
8,10,Stan,"Right now, goddamnit!
"
3,8,Stan,"Hit something nice and solid now. 
"
15,11,Randy,"And then she does. It's a metaphor.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It's time for us to take back our pride!
"
4,13,Cartman,"Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!
"
16,11,Cartman,"Holy shit balls! Holy shit balls! Guess what, you guys? Holy shit balls. 
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, now you're just gonna feel a little pinch.
"
15,11,Randy,"This is what I get! I drank from the lie that is Broadway and now it has my daughter!
"
4,16,Cartman,"Butters, calm down, alright?
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Get the fuck off of me!)
"
8,1,Kyle,"I- I can't do it... I can't do it. I...
"
10,6,Cartman,"This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off!  Goddammit! 
"
4,11,Cartman,"The Lord wants you to walk, Timmih! Oo-walk, Timmih! 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Will you stop with the whole ""mom smoking crack"" thing?! It's a old joke!
"
18,1,Cartman,"I guess we gotta go back to school. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"They kind of look like us.  I mean, Stan's got blue eyes and I've got a sharper nose, but I mean, they kinda look like us.
"
8,8,Butters,"A turd sandwich is not only the first turd to be nominated school mascot, but even the first sandwich. 
"
15,12,Stan,"God this sucks!
"
3,6,Kyle,"You're trying to confuse me now, aren't you?
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Stop!)  (Officer Barbrady, I really need to talk to you!)  (Shit!)
"
6,5,Cartman,"Oh, you've gotta be kidding' me!
"
8,3,Kyle,"No! I'm on the away team too! 
"
4,15,Stan,"Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?
"
10,8,Cartman,"Butters? What the hell are you doing?
"
2,7,Kyle,"Yeah, all you have to do is fart some more, Cartman! And the visitors are sure to come!
"
2,10,Cartman,"No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh okay.  Let's go NASCAR! 
"
10,1,Stan,"Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. 
"
9,5,Randy,"Greeley sucks! Greeley sucks!
"
12,3,Kyle,"Look at yourself! You've got to lay off the cheese! 
"
16,13,Butters,"And he says, ""Well you still should oughta read it, but you're gonna need to put an asterisk next to Jesus' name whenever it comes up.""
"
2,13,Kyle,"That was a waste of money, Cartman!
"
2,15,Stan,"I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!
"
9,2,Randy,"I'm a geologist!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Just another minute.
"
7,8,Stan,"I know!
"
12,6,Randy,"Oh no you're not!
"
12,8,Butters,"I don't want a gun, Eric!
"
11,9,Randy,"Hey guys!
"
7,13,Kyle,"God-damnit! 
"
12,9,Butters,"But some people think you crapped on Teacher's desk, uh to get out of the fight.
"
13,10,Stan,"Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. 
"
2,10,Stan,"Huh?
"
8,5,Butters,"Yeah, we're makin' a bunch more money. I can't believe it either. 
"
14,9,Kyle,"No, it isn't!
"
2,18,Kyle,"No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Uh, sir, d'I have a lot of homework to do tonight and I was-
"
15,1,Stan,"69ingchipmunks@me.com 
"
4,14,Cartman,"How good?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Wuu, Garrison-san sabuchii dana. 
"
6,1,Butters,"Wuh hey now, they do too! Uh, my mom and dad - love me even if I am fat.
"
4,17,Kyle,"-And I'll labor. 
"
16,9,Kyle,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have an epidemic in our country. Obesity is costing taxpayers millions, and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed. Over the past several days I have filmed such a case, and the shocking video has been edited by my partner, Token. It is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue. 
"
18,7,Cartman,"You guys!  I have accepted the reality that I am just a computer program. The fact is that one of us right now is in a room wearing a VR helmet seeing all this, and it's not me!
"
16,12,Stan,"What are you gonna do?  Please! Please just let me go! No!
"
2,14,Cartman,"Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated here.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Oh, I have such a pretty mother. Such a wonderful mother.
"
6,2,Kyle,"Good job, dude!
"
1,8,Kyle,"Because why?
"
2,14,Kyle,"Hey, that's a great idea!
"
7,11,Butters,"But I'm the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?
"
7,6,Stan,"Yes, I have a suit that needs to be dry-cleaned. And pressed, please.
"
13,11,Stan,"It's like... they know. 
"
5,9,Stan,"No, dude. America may have some problems, but it's our home. Our team. And if you don't wanna root for your team, then you should get the hell out of the stadium.
"
7,8,Timmy,"Oooo, Timmy. 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Don't you get it Mom?! People voted for Obama, so now that everything sucks they have to blame me!  They didn't take my Stormtrooper watch...  My Arkham City game is still here... what else could they have-   Oh my God.  Clyde Frog!
"
11,6,Kyle,"Jimmy, did you finish your book report?
"
18,10,Kyle,"Hm, I wasn't really going for ""gay,"" I was more going for ""wholesome.""
"
2,10,Stan,"But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
"
18,7,Butters,"Whoa! Huh, I'm in the car now
"
5,3,Cartman,"No you're not.
"
14,1,Cartman,"Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie.
"
16,8,Randy,"That was a great hit boys. Remember that at practice tomorrow.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Let's go NASCAR!  I'm not moving, Butters.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Cartman, you need to stop this stupid little game you're playing!
"
3,9,Kyle,"...Oh. Kenny isn't special?
"
11,13,Stan,"Ugh. Damint.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Come on, you guys! Hurry!  Guys, hurry!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Really?!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Furry Balls Plopped Menacingly On The Table, Incorporated!
"
6,16,Butters,"Hey, that's neato, huh, Stan?
"
3,11,Stan,"We're on like, some foreign planet.
"
3,9,Kyle,"No, Ike! Ma, Ike keeps taking off his Squirt uniform!
"
16,5,Cartman,"'Kay kewl, hold it right there. Kewl. 
"
9,5,Cartman,"Aw Goddamnit! 
"
14,5,Randy,"Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... 
"
12,1,Kyle,"...Excuse me, I have to step out for a minute. 
"
18,6,Kenny,"(Fuck?!)
"
7,15,Cartman,"Twenty hours until Christmas. Our parents still have time to buy us presents IF we hurry. 
"
9,11,Cartman,"Right, the plan. Um... Oh. Oh, my God, you guys! Uh, I just realized something.  We shouldn't be doing this. Ah I mean, look at us.  What have we become?
"
8,3,Cartman,"One month ago today, this amazing film opened in theaters. And now, we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message!  Fellow fans of Mel Gibson, our numbers have grown and now, together, we have the power to change the world!  Now I believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie!
"
11,3,Cartman,"They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. 
"
4,8,Kyle,"Y-yeah, but… the color of someone's skin doesn't matter.
"
7,4,Kenny,"(I'm doing my homework.)
"
9,9,Cartman,"Are we sure about this? We'll never know the future.
"
16,2,Kyle,"We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!
"
12,13,Mr. Mackey,"Just a minute to go in the first quarter. 
"
11,9,Randy,"I say...  Let's give Bono a run for his money!  Yeah!!  YYEEAAHHHH!
"
14,11,Cartman,"Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.
"
3,6,Cartman,"Oh, then you won't mind if I take it! 
"
17,9,Kyle,"I am no longer an XBox guy! I let my friend get grounded, but today I will give him a PlayStation!
"
11,8,Kyle,"No! Up yours, fatboy!
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Very well. I guess... I'm not a teacher anymore.  I suppose you'll be wanting my badge and gun... 
"
2,18,Stan,"Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Orange who?
"
11,14,Stan,"Cartman, lay off! You're next to last.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"N-no, Dad.
"
1,6,Kyle,"Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Uh what are those? 
"
7,10,Stan,"Oh Jesus!
"
3,3,Cartman,"Maybe it's just a phase. We just have to get him alone so we can tell him what a bitch she is.
"
11,10,Butters,"Y-yeah, and that's not a heartfelt speech?
"
9,14,Randy,"Oh yeah?  Get off my ass, dickhole!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Oh. Hi, N-N-Nancy.
"
8,2,Kyle,"Well all right, we'll see you on Saturday, guys.
"
7,14,Butters,"W-we are.
"
13,5,Wendy,"You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman.
"
8,11,Kyle,"Geez, all that from a stupid video show.
"
16,1,Randy,"Yeah, I think we've just gotta live with the TSA. 
"
13,9,Butters,"We could have our very own...  kissin' company.
"
8,7,Stan,"It's affecting kids too! Me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business. We were trying to be responsible and make money, you know? But then the people came along and, and now we're out of work too!  Oh, they took our jobs!
"
7,13,Cartman,"God, he's just the best!  Mr. Reiner, can I get you a muffin? O-or a cold drink, perhaps?
"
8,3,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! I'd like to see you try, asshole! I'm like six feet tall!
"
10,3,Randy,"All right, make sure your snorkel is working.  All right, now get your head in the hole.
"
2,12,Kyle,"What?
"
5,13,Kyle,"What, did he lose a hundred pounds? 
"
16,7,Kyle,"That fat turd up there is the one who set up you and Token 'cause he thinks blacks belong together! 
"
8,4,Butters,"Oh well, hi there everybody. 
"
10,3,Stan,"They censored the image of Mohammad? How?
"
6,8,Randy,"Stan, you're an atheist now!
"
9,12,Stan,"I can't tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling! All I know is that I was depressed before, and now I found meaning!
"
4,16,Stan,"Dude! Having no parents is awesome! I'm gonna say my parents molestered me, too.
"
11,12,Kyle,"I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!
"
7,4,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I hope you little Commies are pretty pleased with yourselves!  Going out there and protesting America, and then saying on national television that you don't even know who the Founding Fathers are! You kids don't know squat about America, do you?!
"
10,9,Stan,"How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!
"
9,13,Cartman,"Hurry it up, dude, we have a rocket to catch.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Okay, Butters, let's start with you. I think I've found a great way to get revenge on your parents. Just... tell me if I'm going in the right direction here.  What we're going to do, Butters, is we're going to wait for your parents to leave the house, and then, smear all the walls... with poop.
"
7,3,Cartman,"What are you talking about? This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!
"
5,6,Stan,"Look. Cartman... he thinks he's gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park, but, he's gonna find out that without other people, the rides are totally lame. I mean, who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park? I'll bet he's sick of it already.
"
2,14,Stan,"What, dude?
"
8,3,Stan,"We go to church to learn that stuff! We go to movies to be entertained! We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!
"
17,3,Kyle,"That's what bothering you? Not the fact that you're a murderer?
"
9,13,Cartman,"Oh crap! There's more of them! 
"
16,5,Butters,"Heh, h-hey fellas. 
"
2,6,Kyle,"Come on! We've gotta make another one! 
"
12,8,Butters,"Herro prease. Ting tao ding ling.
"
10,1,Kyle,"Yeah!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Smell sequence initiated.
"
10,12,Butters,"Oh boy!
"
17,2,Wendy,"Mr. Garrison, can you do something about this, please?  Mr. Garrison?!
"
1,1,Stan,"Whoa! 
"
17,2,Randy,"Hi. Corey Lanskin?
"
11,4,Kyle,"Yeah?
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"No, don't!  Is that okay to show?
"
1,1,Cartman,"Oh, I see. Now you're going to join in on the little joke huh?
"
18,10,Randy,"Yes, they made a copy of me and they don't want me around anymore. They're about to do something big, and they need famous artists to be controlled for it.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Kill you? Oh no. I have much bigger plans for you now.
"
16,6,Kyle,"So then we sit there for like, thirty minutes, because we had to wait for this couple who was running late. 
"
6,10,Stan,"Cartman's?
"
5,4,Cartman,"I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.
"
4,17,Stan,"Ho-o-oh.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Wing?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"That's an amm-mmazing coincidence. I mean, there's not one crippled colored person in South Park. 
"
9,9,Stan,"He's just dancing around.
"
1,6,Cartman,"Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!
"
1,7,Stan,"What?
"
6,10,Wendy,"She's not smarter and cooler than everyone, you guys are just drawn to something else! 
"
5,8,Kyle,"I've almost got it!
"
2,4,Cartman,"Ham?
"
8,5,Kyle,"Why?
"
2,7,Stan,"You dumbass, Cartman! That's not the way it happened!
"
3,12,Stan,"Okay, grab the sled. 
"
4,9,Kyle,"I wanna be the tough one.
"
11,7,Randy,"He's become one of them.
"
16,8,Stan,"Not at this you don't! What about that creamy filling you talked about? That gooey goodness inside you that makes you the butteriest Butters we know?
"
11,12,Cartman,"What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!
"
1,10,Stan,"Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Lame.
"
1,12,Kyle,"Aagh! Stop that!
"
1,7,Kyle,"...No, dude, that's Christmas.
"
4,9,Stan,"Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. 
"
1,1,Stan,"Chef.
"
18,10,Randy,"Then we'll do it together. I love children just as much as you do.
"
17,10,Wendy,"That's how people like Kim Kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere.
"
16,8,Mr. Mackey,"Hnkay, would, would you mind being the coach of the South Park sarcastaball team?
"
17,9,Kenny,"Hai, Purincessu Kenni assisuto! 
"
15,2,Stan,"We told you doing a comedy award was a bad idea! Now all of Germany is pissed off at us!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Now, come on, there's gonna be over 4 million third-graders from all over the country there, and I wanna make sure South Park is the best! Okay?!  Recorders up.  And a-1 and a-2 and a-  ""...of liberty."" You're late!  ""...my father-"" What the hell was that?!  God-damnit, I don't think you children have been working on your fingering!
"
12,13,Butters,"Hey, you got the lead, Wendy. 
"
3,17,Kyle,"Oh, no!
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
17,1,Cartman,"Like six hours, dude. And my friends were all like ""Dude, Cartman, we need you to keep playing defense!""
"
4,1,Cartman,"Just hand over the God-damned cigarettes!
"
4,10,Timmy,"Haaaaah!
"
3,10,Kenny,"(Nuh uh.) 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Denver Nuggets game?
"
4,17,Stan,"That took us half an hour to set up, fatass!
"
2,9,Kenny,"(Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh) 
"
8,11,Butters,"Yeah! I read 'em all the time! Uh here's one: the uh, snail tripped over a hurdle, and the other snail says ""Well that's gonna add another hour to his time.""  Yeah! You guys!  Heh.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! And now, I'm receiving a message directly from God-uh! God is telling me that... each and every one of you is to walk up to the stage, and give me one dollar!  So I want everyone to feel the love of God by coming up heah,  and putting a dollar in the box-ah!  Come on, don't be shy! Come on now! 
"
6,3,Cartman,"That's awesome, Kenny. 
"
7,9,Cartman,"Your family's black, Token! There's bound to be a bass guitar in your basement somewhere! 
"
18,7,Butters,"I feel amazing!  I'm back outside now. I'm a baaaaad man! You hear me?!  Eh take that, you stupid cars! 
"
2,5,Cartman,"Heyh! They have a zoo there!
"
2,10,Kyle,"This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Yeh, we're running out of friends.
"
1,2,Cartman,"Yes!
"
1,11,Cartman,"Did you make love?
"
2,8,Kyle,"Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison.
"
5,3,Stan,"Oh wait, who am I again?
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Oh! Agh! Ju-just a second! 
"
13,11,Cartman,"What dude?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Haaha! I saw you get the picture back from Mr. Kitty, and that's why I wrote a letter to the press! To be opened in the case of my demise! Should anything happen to me, that letter will go out, and you will never find it!
"
3,11,Kyle,"Watch out! Here I come!
"
9,9,Cartman,"Video playback initialized. 
"
1,10,Stan,"Here Jesus, drink these raw eggs.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Look! I'm just asking you guys for help. Will you please help me with Ms. Lopez.
"
12,10,Randy,"Something's going on outside! Stay, stay here! 
"
12,6,Randy,"Everybody just, just calm down! Calm down, all right?! It's going to be okay! We just CAN'T. PANIC. 
"
1,7,Cartman,"Aw, come on Stan, maybe that's just because you look like a total choad.
"
16,10,Randy,"Sorry sorry, that's me.  Hello?
"
8,13,Butters,"Yeah. I think it'd be better to start lower.
"
6,10,Cartman,"Put the lotion in the fuckin' basket!
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, what are you doing in Grandpa's extra wheelchair?!
"
7,13,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, kids, can I have it quiet, please? M'kay? M'kay, quiet now, the assembly's about to start, m'kay. M'kay, quiet ple-mk-m'kay?  M'kay. Uh, now kids, we have a really fun motivational group today who are gonna talk to you about the dangers of smoking, m'kay? So please give a very big South Park Cows welcome to, ""Butt Out!"" 
"
12,9,Cartman,"What's up, Wendy? I thought we were meeting early to fight.
"
2,15,Cartman,"All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!
"
3,3,Cartman,"I'm just gonna take them off as soon as I leave!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Okay.  Stan, let's be partners, dude. 
"
10,14,Stan,"What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!
"
13,14,Cartman,"Help! Help!
"
3,14,Randy,"Well, the Union be damned!
"
2,15,Stan,"Do you think animals can be murderers, too?
"
5,9,Kenny,"(Ee-hew-hoo!)
"
6,1,Kyle,"It's out of control! 
"
13,14,Cartman,"NO! No I don't wanna live in your world, do you understand?! Your world is cold and devoid of any humanity! Just kill me! Kill me now! DO IT! 
"
3,10,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
15,5,Kyle,"I got a job, Stan. I am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff.
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah, huh, I got you!
"
5,9,Stan,"Goddamnit, get the hell out of here, Towelie!
"
16,5,Kyle,"If you really think every kid in America should see your anti-bullying movie, then why don't you put it on the Internet for free?!
"
11,3,Cartman,"All right, see you there!  Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!
"
15,8,Cartman,"Turn on your heart light. Let it shine wherever you go. Let it make a happy glow-
"
7,10,Cartman,"With just ten seconds to go, the offense makes its move. Marsh heads for the goal and passes the ball to the poor kid. The poor kid hands it out to the Jew! The Jew shoots. Awww, and the shot is blocked again , proving once and for all that Jews cannot play hockey!
"
3,1,Cartman,"What if you don't have any rhythm?
"
6,13,Cartman,"A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!
"
10,14,Stan,"Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?
"
7,15,Kyle,"Can we just get going, please?
"
10,8,Kyle,"Oh yeah.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"How do you know?! You you haven't s-seen it yet!
"
10,9,Kyle,"I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there.
"
13,3,Kyle,"What? 
"
6,2,Cartman,"So last night, while Butters was asleep, I gave him a Hitler.
"
12,6,Randy,"Now let's see some bestiality.  Aahahaha, yes! Ogh!  Let's get some Brazilian fart porn in there!  Oh that's good eh! Oh!  Ohhhhhhhhh! Hoh! Hohhh! 
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"I know, I know, but I'm afraid this problem has run very deep through Mr. Garrison's mental state. I'm worried that if... you don't do something, well it could kill him.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing here?! You quit!
"
10,8,Randy,"Where's your car?
"
13,9,Butters,"And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Hey dudes.  Ha ha ha ha! Look at Cartman and his stupid glasses! Ha ha ha ha!
"
12,8,Butters,"Not now, Eric, I'm ih I'm indecent.
"
2,10,Cartman,"And his momma cried
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto In the ghetto
"
13,11,Stan,"Then that's where I belong.
"
18,2,Wendy,"Yeah, sure. You guys really pulled it off.
"
6,16,Stan,"They've all been lying to us this whole time!
"
15,1,Cartman,"Mom, everyone knows that everything but Apple is stupid!
"
17,7,Cartman,"Iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show, Paladin Butters.
"
18,2,Kyle,"Hey guys!
"
9,5,Stan,"This can't get any worse. 
"
6,1,Kyle,"Dude! That's today!
"
7,14,Butters,"Yeah.  It sure does hurt.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Mm, mhm, mhm.
"
1,8,Kyle,"What did she say?
"
1,5,Cartman,"Your sister beat you up again, huh?
"
16,5,Cartman,"He has a point.
"
10,8,Cartman,"Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout.
"
5,10,Kyle,"Uh
"
8,1,Cartman,"Dr. Shafley?
"
16,14,Kyle,"Oh shit! Don't let him swallow it! 
"
2,18,Kyle,"What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Fellas! Fellas, I got fant-tastic news! The vice-President, Dick Cheney, was in Denver yesterday, and I got an interview with him for our news show. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"Sure, outlander. I'll get it 
"
14,5,Stan,"It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-
"
11,1,Randy,"Thanks, Pat!
"
8,3,Kyle,"Look out!! 
"
10,9,Kyle,"Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!
"
4,2,Kyle,"No way!
"
2,12,Wendy,"Hi, Stan.
"
3,3,Stan,"We know what you are, lady!
"
2,12,Kenny,"(Fine!)
"
3,10,Kyle,"What?
"
1,1,Kyle,"Dude, what does the note say?
"
18,5,Butters,"I love you too, Dad. 
"
4,8,Stan,"Wait, I don't get it.
"
6,4,Butters,"Hehey! This is gonna be just like Vietnam, huh fellas! Whoopie!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Whoa, dude, this is our new classroom?
"
4,14,Wendy,"She can't see hear, John. Watch. Helen!
"
3,16,Cartman,"Well, we're going with our families to Las Vegas. I guess there'll be some younger kids there, too, if you wanna go.
"
10,3,Cartman,"Yich.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Oh no! No!!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Well if they're not gonna give us back the doll, then we have no choice. Let's go tell on them. 
"
4,16,Cartman,"Well, I guess you're screwed, then. 
"
12,12,Kyle,"Dude, have you seen my parents? 
"
2,12,Cartman,"Fine!
"
10,9,Cartman,"Aha! Do you see?
"
4,16,Kyle,"Yeah. I guess their rules did have a point. Things have gotten a lot worse in the ten days since they've been gone.
"
8,9,Stan,"It's a mirror.
"
3,15,Stan,"It fell;
"
8,7,Cartman,"What?! Who?!
"
12,1,Cartman,"What?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, Mr. Slave! 
"
4,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well, there you go, m'kay?
"
8,14,Stan,"It's... nice.
"
6,7,Stan,"We need you to promise not to tell anybody.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Whoa, dude!
"
7,9,Butters,"Oh...
"
6,1,Butters,"Whoa, everything's getting sparkly. 
"
14,10,Randy,"Ahhh.
"
14,6,Randy,"Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say.  I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume? 
"
2,4,Stan,"Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
"
1,5,Cartman,"Yeah, if some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like, ""hey, why don't you stop dressin' me up like a mailman, annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy I don't even know, on my dad's bed!"" 
"
7,6,Stan,"Have you reported this to any other authorities?
"
5,3,Kyle,"Thanks for saving us Stan. You're my Super Best Friend.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Okay.)
"
10,13,Cartman,"Over here!  Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this. 
"
7,6,Stan,"Bang bang bang! I got you, Fosse!
"
10,3,Kenny,"(Like what?)
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"Jimbo!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Because it's wrong! If you guys aren't happy with the way you look, then that's your problem! 
"
15,13,Kyle,"Cool. Cool... You wanna order some dessert?
"
2,4,Kyle,"And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
"
13,10,Jimmy,"What are you doing here, El, El Pollo Loco?
"
9,13,Kyle,"Hey you guys! You guys are not gonna believe this!
"
10,13,Butters,"But...  but you're here right now. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"What's ""bad touch""?
"
8,10,Stan,"But Mo-o-o-
"
9,2,Randy,"I'm the... only scientist in town.
"
15,13,Stan,"Wow, check it out dude, we're on TV. 
"
1,2,Cartman,"Yeah I do, pop tarts are frosted.
"
5,3,Stan,"Then what are we going to do.
"
8,5,Cartman,"You saw that?
"
16,9,Kyle,"Who's Honey Boo Boo?
"
13,10,Cartman,"And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
"
1,9,Mr. Mackey,"So this must be a pretty hard time of year for you, being Christmas and all.  Do the other kids make fun of ya?
"
16,3,Cartman,"Mr. Kitty, do you mind explaining this?  You wanna tell me why you're putting pictures of yourself on the Internet with bread around your face? This is a bad kitty. Bad! You're taking the idea of Faith Hilling and making it stupid. Bad kitty.  Bad Mr. Kitty.  Bad kitty! No more memeing!  Come on, guys.  Bad Mr. Kitty!
"
4,15,Kyle,"Aw, don't be such a baby!  You do it, Kenny.
"
6,4,Cartman,"We didn't make it! Your mother's right, douchebag! What are we gonna do? Stand here until we starve?!
"
7,1,Kyle,"I think we ditched them.
"
6,16,Cartman,"The note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away, back at my office.
"
14,2,Cartman,"Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!
"
18,5,Butters,"My dad said it's not for spying on people.
"
15,8,Cartman,"We're uh gonna need some more patties pretty soon.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Stop who?
"
7,13,Cartman,"Sorry Kyle, but I'm afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow! Hahahaha! Thought you had me with your Serbian Jew double bluff, didn't you?! Well let's see you try to open this door now.  Hahahahaha! Haa haa hahahahahaha! Haa haa haha- 
"
8,3,Kyle,"People don't hate the Jews!
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"IT gets over 300 miles to the gallon, and is safely capable of speeds of over 200 miles per hour.
"
8,1,Stan,"Butters! Oh my God!  Oh, dude! It's stuck in his eye!
"
6,7,Butters,"Oh sweet Jesus!
"
6,13,Butters,"Let me have the tape!
"
12,11,Butters,"Hello, heh.
"
3,13,Kyle,"Definition?
"
4,11,Timmy,"Haagggh.
"
10,10,Cartman,"Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?!
"
4,1,Stan,"Yeah, you stupid umbassday!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Okay, Not-Kenny.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Where's the heart?
"
11,9,Randy,"I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.
"
2,10,Randy,"Stanley, where the hell have you been?
"
10,1,Kyle,"But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Stan, you said your mom was bringing Kentucky Fried Chicken home for dinner! Now is she or isn't she?!
"
17,9,Stan,"Yeah, I know what you mean. Well look, guys, XBox won the console wars, I mean, what are we gonna do? Not play video games?
"
12,9,Wendy,"No!
"
6,4,Stan,"What are they doing here?
"
6,17,Cartman,"Wow, is that where Santa lives?
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I thought it was mostly women that read these things!
"
12,7,Butters,"We should get back to Pioneer Village, that's what we should do!
"
5,8,Kyle,"Yeah, what it is, Mrs. Marsh?
"
5,9,Stan,"A-ah, hi. We're from America.  Uh, we sent you the dollar? Uh, the four dollars? You, you sent us this goat?
"
13,12,Cartman,"But Cartman isn't letting up on him. 
"
8,7,Kyle,"This is really gay.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Hey, screw you.
"
11,2,Kyle,"Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman.
"
6,13,Randy,"We...  Well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidently put a...porno in The Lord of the Rings box. 
"
5,4,Stan,"Jesus Christ, dude!
"
2,18,Kyle,"No, dude! We have to name it Steve.
"
16,7,Kenny,"(Yeah, what's her name?)
"
7,13,Stan,"Give me a hit. Give me another one, give me another one. 
"
11,10,Cartman,"Ohhh, Ms. Broflovski, how are you this fine evening?
"
7,11,Kyle,"I know you don't. 
"
11,14,Stan,"It was about shoes, Kyle. The girls wanted shoes, so they set you up.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.
"
6,4,Cartman,"All right, we'll keep ours. We'll send out one calf. 
"
6,3,Stan,"Dude! One of us should make up some disease and get on the Maury Povich show so we can win a prize!
"
4,12,Stan,"Hey, that's it! We gotta go back to third grade!
"
5,14,Butters,"Ah, I'm sorry. The car just rolled into the lake, and it floated all the way down the river. I tried callin' home, but it was-
"
7,5,Cartman,"Okay, Ms. Lopez, time to go to sleep. 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Let's be partners, Kenny.
"
1,12,Cartman,"No! That's my walkie-talkie, he gave it to me!
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, right, right. Take a seat.
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"You know, you boys might want to visit the Genetic Engineering Ranch outside of town for some help.  And you could both use this for your science fair projects next month. 
"
16,7,Mr. Garrison,"And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon , and he asked Eddard, also known as, of course, Lord Stark, to serve as hand of the king. You remember that Lord Stark accepted, or course. The queen's family - that's the Lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren't they? But where were the Targaryens at this time? Well, they were across the sea. We all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. So we've got the Greeks, the Romans, the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in Season 2. Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that's just a whole other mess- 
"
6,16,Stan,"Huh?
"
9,6,Butters,"Helll- Uh all right. All right, I'll help you!
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Ow!)
"
14,1,Butters,"Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??
"
4,17,Stan,"Tralalalala
"
4,14,Cartman,"Okay! Now we can really get this thing underway! Places, everybody!  Where the hell is Timmy?
"
4,2,Kyle,"Yeah, let's go. 
"
8,11,Kyle,"Dude, bail?
"
5,6,Cartman,"Line? Lines! I HATE LINES!!! Can't you go on something else right now? 
"
14,2,Stan,"Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!
"
4,15,Butters,"Huh-I'm in for five!
"
18,5,Butters,"I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig's mom we're sorry and that we'll-
"
5,9,Butters,"What?!  Oh, Jesus! I don't wanna get the 'thrax, fellas! Uh, what do I do?
"
6,13,Jimmy,"N-n-no, you retards! The video s...tore!
"
4,9,Kyle,"It was?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Well of couse I wanna get laid. That's why I'm taking you to this ...fancy place and pretending to be interested in what you have to say..
"
6,1,Cartman,"Come on, Butters, you gotta get skinny again!  You are such a flabby hunk of crap! Look at those jelly rolls! Jelly rolls I tell ya!! You still got seven chins, boah! You'll never be thin!! Nobody loves you!
"
5,3,Kyle,"Dude, no way! 
"
4,9,Randy,"See ya. 
"
15,7,Kyle,"Here, this one's from me, Stan.
"
8,3,Stan,"Hey, we want our money back.
"
9,12,Stan,"Seven and two.
"
13,2,Mr. Garrison,"Wow, a kid from my class was Mysterion.
"
12,9,Mr. Mackey,"Eh somebod - somebody call the principal! 
"
6,13,Butters,"Whoa.  Neat-o.  Well, this is good.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"It isn't working. Sing your song, Mr. Slave.
"
10,2,Mr. Mackey,"It's simply asking too much.
"
1,8,Cartman,"Yeah, that's right.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Out! 
"
8,1,Stan,"Kiya! Kiya!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Hey whoa, we are here because the average score was low. That's about all of us.
"
13,8,Kyle,"Mister... Jackson, y-you aren't alive. You're in purgatory.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Hey, dude. Do you like to rock?!  Yes, I like to rock! Helloo, Baltimore!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Hey!
"
6,17,Cartman,"I'm riding in Santa's sleigh. So high above the trees at Christmastime. With candy-cane wishes and smiles-
"
18,6,Stan,"I'll pay you back for it, okay?!
"
7,14,Kyle,"Yeah! Like Stan gives a crap if Wendy breaks up!  Stan? 
"
3,2,Randy,"I suspect you're talking about the dramatic heat wave.
"
14,2,Stan,"All right!
"
13,4,Stan,"Mom, gross! 
"
4,1,Cartman,"I want my Mo-omm 
"
2,12,Cartman,"What are you guys doing?
"
11,14,Kyle,"So what number was I??
"
12,11,Stan,"Hey, we aren't the ones on an ancient temple prophecy wall, buttwipe!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Date-rape psychosis.
"
3,3,Kyle,"No way, dude!
"
14,3,Randy,"That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
"
15,8,Cartman,"Godamned stupid school nurse! Heartless bitch!
"
8,3,Stan,"That's bullcrap dude, let's go get our money back.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Sorry Eric, but I really need to work, very much. I haven't written a good joke in over a week.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Holy shit, dude! Cartman's right! 
"
1,7,Wendy,"Maybe we could actually kiss tonight Stan.  Eww, gross Stan, sick! Barf is gross! 
"
2,12,Stan,"Oooh.
"
7,9,Kyle,"You'll never get a platinum album doing Christian rock, Cartman! It was a stupid idea then, and it's a stupid idea now!
"
16,10,Randy,"Yours? What?
"
7,3,Kyle,"Ah! Oh God! Oh God!
"
8,14,Stan,"Yeah. Yeah, there is.
"
1,1,Cartman,"I'm not fat. And you obviously like her because you throw up every time she talks to you.
"
1,13,Stan,"Come on, Kenny, get the go-cart going. I wanna ride it.
"
9,11,Stan,"Run, dude, run!!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Over the meadow and through the woods...
"
1,1,Wendy,"Huh?
"
3,13,Cartman,"Eh, not right this second, mother. Put them there by the door.
"
2,4,Stan,"Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?
"
2,12,Kyle,"It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Alright! Let's do it, boys! 
"
9,3,Cartman,"Jew! 
"
16,14,Cartman,"But where could they be? Where? And why would I care so much about the election results? So may questions, Kyle. So... little time. 
"
3,2,Randy,"Wow!
"
2,2,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
2,8,Stan,"Heard what?
"
13,7,Cartman,"Alright lads, guess we'll have to settle with this meager ship. Two of you sit aft and two of you sit in the front.
"
14,14,Randy,"Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion!  Ooo yeah, fuck yeah.
"
11,6,Kyle,"Our whole weekend is shot.
"
3,11,Cartman,"Wait. Ms. Struthers? Ms. Struthers!
"
9,7,Butters,"Hehey Jimmy!  M'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You'll probably win like always.
"
3,6,Kyle,"Because! Everyone is suing everyone else, and you're pretty much the cause of it all!
"
6,12,Cartman,"GODDAMMIT!!!
"
4,9,Randy,"Uh sure.
"
18,10,Stan,"What?? 
"
3,10,Kyle,"Camp?
"
9,10,Stan,"Governor's office?
"
6,16,Stan,"Who the fuck is is, Mom and Dad?
"
15,9,Stan,"Base! 
"
17,5,Kyle,"Mr. Mackey, can I talk to you?
"
3,3,Kyle,"They said that Chef works in one of these buildings 
"
5,9,Stan,"There's nothing you can do except stop breathing.
"
3,14,Cartman,"But why? Why should they get the bell?
"
10,9,Mr. Mackey,"Oh no, not the Goddamned-
"
11,4,Stan,"Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Kenny, think about it. Don't you want a  Sega Dreamcast?
"
5,6,Kyle,"And that's it? That's the end?
"
15,7,Stan,"Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don't like it. I don't like it at all, Kyle.
"
13,7,Cartman,"""It isn't safe."" That's not what you said back in the cafeteria, Kyle. In the cafeteria you said Somalia was ""awesome.""
"
16,9,Kyle,"Right, you're not fat.
"
5,12,Kyle,"Aharmani Exchange?
"
14,3,Randy,"Yeah, but what's the quickest way?
"
13,7,Kyle,"Nono, you're right. Somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls. It's totally the pirate's life.
"
13,10,Cartman,"I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! 
"
12,11,Randy,"No, it's a guinea mouse, stupid! 
"
2,2,Cartman,"Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!
"
11,11,Stan,"Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland.
"
4,8,Kenny,"(What?)  (Oh oooooooOOOOOOOH!) 
"
6,5,Stan,"But we have to watch the commercials in this show.
"
6,1,Butters,"Wuh well I told you my parents would be sore, and they said for... havin' liposuction surgery, I can't play outside for five days.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Stan, why don't you just ask the question?
"
5,11,Kyle,"I'm back.
"
9,9,Butters,"How?
"
3,4,Stan,"How come you wanna take home ec., Kenny?
"
4,13,Cartman,"Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done.
"
17,8,Jimmy,"It's the enemy! Defensive po-po-p-po-p-positions! 
"
4,7,Cartman,"Yes, well, until then, I need about ten million dollars.
"
12,13,Stan,"No, fuck off. I'm not doing it.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Students, I would like to introduce you all to the future.  M'kay. Starting today, our school will be operating entirely on IntelliLink.  Now whenever you need to see the school nurse, or talk to me, your counselor, you can simply sign up using this simple, integrated portal.  M'kay...  You can use a computer or any of the IntelliLink panels which are located throughout the school.  Lat's say you're in the cafeteria, m'kay. You start cougin' up blood and need to see the nurse. You just click on ""school clinic"" Mkay, see nurse. M'kay. Respiration problems.  Uh, okay, I must have I must have been in the wrong menu, uhkay. As you can see, you can control the sound system as well. Okay.  It's all integrated and smartlinked, and this is a great idea, m'kay. Let's look at the message board.  Mesage... board.  Here you can easily write messages to each other or to the faculty, m'kay? For instance,  here we go. Here's a message from Kyle's little brother, Ike Broflovski.  Okay, little Ike says ""My brother is a homo"" Ike made a little drawing of his brother too.  Drew a nice picture with a... nice bird hangin' off Kyle's forehead, m'kay, that's nice.  It's a nice... crane, a nice whoopin' crane comin' off Kyle's head there.
"
4,7,Butters,"Oh, uhuh alright, then. 
We're so sorry you're not feeling well.
We hope you're better soon.
So we're bringing you some sunshine
By, um, singing you this tune:
Everybody misses you
And though we hate to cause a fuss
We'd like to say, ""Get well soon!""
And ""Please don't die on us.""
"
8,1,Kyle,"Then it's not too late!
"
8,3,Stan,"We think the movie sucked and we want Mel Gibson to give us back our eighteen dollars. Do you know how we can get in touch with him?
"
15,11,Randy,"No, they're... they're bros, Sharon. Stephen Sondheim, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber... They're total bros who hang out at Hooters. Sharon, I'm so sorry.
"
1,7,Mr. Garrison,"Wait your turn Clyde.
"
10,12,Cartman,"What??
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Yup, looks like I'm gonna be rich.  And famous.
"
8,11,Butters,"Sexy Action School News Team, ho! 
"
13,12,Stan,"Yes, now get out of here.
"
16,12,Randy,"Stan?! Daddy wants to have a little talk, Stan! Stanny boy?! I'M COMING!  Oh look, Wedding Crashers.  What are you doing, Shelly?
"
10,1,Kenny,"(Like what?)
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, let's just wait our turn.
"
15,8,Cartman,"I spent all morning making hamburgers for nothing! That's what's the matter!
"
5,13,Cartman,"Better.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Stan! Go get the other guys and tell them to meet me at the bus stop in ten minutes!
"
8,9,Cartman,"Dude, you can't shop for crap. 
"
2,14,Kyle,"Cartman?
"
10,6,Cartman,"Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy!  Kyle, knock it off! 
"
18,5,Randy,"I am. Let's see what Nelson's doing.  Oh shit!  Dude! Neighborhood Watch! I'm Neighborhood Watch!  I've been shot!  No! Noooo!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Psst Butters. Butters!  At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys' locker room.
"
3,4,Kyle,"He'll view it as a challenge when he's getting his ass kicked!
"
2,7,Stan,"Yeah, but the monster outside couldn't be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn't eat you.
"
5,2,Stan,"Are you excited for your first night of Scouts, Timmy??
"
15,13,Kyle,"I actually only just said that sarcastically.
"
18,9,Cartman,"Oh really. Ten thousand subscribers and counting, brah!
"
14,6,Cartman,"My dad was a ginger!
"
4,13,Stan,"Yeah, that's fine.  No, wait!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Why not?
"
1,8,Kyle,"Sally Struthers, dude. She used to be on Full House.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Draw the um- You guys draw the nipples like on the bottom of my asscheecks.
"
12,10,Kyle,"We just wanna go home.
"
7,9,Kyle,"We're not letting you back in the band, Cartman! Fuck off!
"
15,8,Kenny,"(Are you serious?!)
"
1,1,Stan,"What's a dildo, Kenny?
"
4,14,Butters,"The kindergartners! They've got amazing stage effects. Pyrotechnics and what have yous. Why, it's a regular feast for the eyes!
"
14,14,Stan,"No, dad! No!
"
12,13,Cartman,"Ehhhhhhh. 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Do you really think your civilization is better than ours?! You people play games by killing animals, and oppress women!
"
17,8,Cartman,"Your CEOs?
"
1,13,Cartman,"You do?
"
11,12,Kyle,"Because I-  I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of ""real."" They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. 
"
10,9,Stan,"Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?
"
16,8,Cartman,"Let's do this.  Stan, hook up my bra.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Save me!
"
12,9,Cartman,"You wanna throw down, dawg? I'll throw down.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Calm down.
"
10,9,Kyle,"Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?
"
3,4,Kyle,"Well, Craig showed up.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"I'm aware of that.
"
18,8,Kyle,"Come on, Kenny! 
"
9,8,Randy,"Stan, you must listen to me! You must stay indoors! Do not try to go out! Global warming has brought in a new ice age!
"
2,17,Stan,"Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today. And that is why we should all let Harbucks stay! 
"
17,9,Cartman,"Oh okay, that could be a while.  All our men are ready. When the mall opens, blow the whistle. We'll rush through the doors and lock the Sony dorks inside. Alright, now I really do need to take a shit.
"
15,10,Kyle,"Wikileaks.  It says here his name is Wikileaks.
"
11,4,Kyle,"There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally.  Cartman? ...Cartman? 
"
2,10,Kenny,"(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)
"
8,6,Stan,"Haaa! 
"
3,16,Kenny,"(You guys! You guys, I did it! I got my very own period!)
"
18,8,Cartman,"Who is that??
"
12,8,Butters,"Oh jeez...
"
5,9,Kyle,"Oh God, it was horrible!
"
1,9,Wendy,"Unh  Oh!
"
15,9,Randy,"Well, I think it's good.  If the Mexican people feel inspired, good for them. People have a right to go and be happy.  NOOOOOO!
"
9,10,Cartman,"...No.
"
5,4,Cartman,"What?
"
18,3,Butters,"Holy moly! 
"
18,1,Stan,"And we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out,
"
3,16,Kenny,"(No. All I could get was a couple of tampons.)
"
6,14,Butters,"Lemmiwinks? NO!
"
5,4,Cartman,"...Okay.
"
6,15,Stan,"Then you're a stupid douche
"
18,7,Kyle,"We're here dude. Just a little further and we can finally end this.
"
15,5,Stan,"Awww dude, awwww.
"
6,6,Butters,"Not working out?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Gee, thanks a lot. See you next time.
"
8,2,Cartman,"Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids.  Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes!  Grow up! 
"
7,13,Mr. Mackey,"Well you'd better not! Because let me tell you some'n' about smokin'!  Uh, smokin's bad, m'kay.  And uh, if you start smokin' at an early age, m'kay, ih it's gonna be bad.  M'kay, because uh, smoking can lead to all kinds of health problems like cancer.  M'kay, and let me tell you something about cancer, m'kay. Cancer's bad. M'kay, and uh, eh, what?  What the?  Holy shit! M'kay?! 
"
4,14,Stan,"You do?
"
9,9,Kyle,"Can you see anything? 
"
3,16,Stan,"Chef, I have ...this friend, see? And this person is really bummed out, because everyone else the same age has gotten their period, and this person hasn't.
"
17,1,Butters,"It's never too late. There's a place where you can start over. 
"
18,7,Stan,"Yeah I remember. I'm heading back to the access point. 
"
2,3,Kyle,"It says, ""Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--"" What's this word?
"
2,3,Stan,"Oh, my God! They've killed--
"
10,3,Cartman,"Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Are you still trying to give a semen sample?
"
2,5,Kyle,"OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
"
6,14,Mr. Mackey,"Parents, I had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers, m'kay?
"
4,4,Kyle,"Hey wait. I think maybe I have Attention Diffunction Disorder.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Hooray for the earth! We must protect it.  And now, as promised, here are TERRANCE AND PHILLIP, on video! 
"
6,9,Kyle,"You?? Why?
"
17,2,Randy,"Yes?
"
8,10,Kyle,"Okay, so now you'll help us take care of Trent Boyett?
"
1,7,Stan,"Shut up Kyle!
"
4,15,Kyle,"Great.
"
9,13,Kyle,"All right, look, there's gotta be other Third-World countries with space programs. We've gotta split up and find someplace cheaper, that's all.
"
4,3,Cartman,"Hooray!
"
14,3,Randy,"...Well that sucks!  Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
5,9,Stan,"Okay, it's clear. Come on! 
"
2,2,Stan,"No way, dude!
"
15,11,Randy,"Right now, Shelly!  Shelly, you are not watching this trash! Now, come on!
"
5,2,Stan,"...Asshole. 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Kyle please! I'm sorry!
"
6,7,Stan,"Yeah, that'd be funny.
"
17,8,Butters,"What kind do we want?!
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Now, IT is easily operated using four flexigrip handles. Two of them are on each side. Left side for throttle, right side for steering.  The third flexigrip is gently inserted into the anus, to keep the driver in place. 
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, Filmore.  You'll be our first nominee. And who else?  Yes, Jenny.
"
9,6,Butters,"Eric! Calm down.  Stupid butthole God! 
"
12,4,Kyle,"We don't want you to die.
"
17,1,Butters,"Sure, I love the Truth.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Okay. So we put little ""woo"" mouths on all our heads.  And then we shoot that for one frame.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"So that's six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike.  And the last vote is for... Uh, let's see. Flora, I can't tell who you voted for.  You've got the winning vote, Flora. Who d'you pick?
"
3,10,Kenny,"(Nuh uh!)
"
13,14,Stan,"Just drink the pee, Kyle.
"
5,1,Kyle,"Cartman, stop being an asshole! 
"
13,6,Randy,"Do you have any idea how stupid that would make us look?!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih... 
"
2,15,Randy,"Hey, why is the basement door locked? 
"
11,13,Kyle,"Look, just go ahead and play, alright?  Leave me alone.  Can I get a Fresca, please?
"
1,11,Kyle,"A plebeian?
"
1,5,Cartman,"I don't think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant.
"
12,8,Stan,"Let's get out of here!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Gorak's a gay name.
"
1,13,Stan,"Nono. We saw him having a tea party with his stuffed animals.
"
12,13,Stan,"You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him. Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
"
7,9,Butters,"Awww.
"
9,14,Stan,"Where? I can't see.
"
3,16,Kyle,"You got your what?
"
9,12,Stan,"I hope so.
"
16,12,Stan,"No! They're looking for you there!  Sir, you've got to cancel the Monster Mash.
"
5,7,Cartman,"No, you guys, this is really cool. Come on! 
"
17,9,Stan,"Yeah, sure, what about it?
"
2,4,Kyle,"Huh?
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.
"
6,9,Stan,"You guys, close your eyes. Don't look at it.
"
1,11,Stan,"Wow. Hi, Wendy.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Nobody deserves this illness, Stan, Kenny! Nobody! It's awful! And maybe somebody needs to teach Kyle how to have some compassion!
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"You gotta get out!
"
15,2,Stan,"Okay we got it! We got it! 
"
1,1,Cartman,"Ah, son of a bitch!
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah. So hurry up and die, you piece of crap! 
"
17,2,Stan,"...What?!
"
7,13,Randy,"Pfft! That's none's the cool.
"
1,2,Wendy,"Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.
"
10,8,Randy,"Stan?  Stan?
"
1,4,Stan,"What don't I understand?
"
4,7,Stan,"And that has something to do with their medicines because...?
"
13,7,Cartman,"Dude, I'm a pirate! What the devil do I care what me mudder thinks anymore?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Okay, Cartman. You ready?
"
8,1,Kyle,"Dude, they don't care we knocked Butters' eye out with weapons?
"
7,9,Kyle,"Our band can't find a stylistic direction to go in. We need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of CDs to listen to so we can define our sound.
"
12,7,Stan,"Hey, m-Murderin' Murphy, you see that there feller?
"
18,9,Randy,"Thank you! Thanks a lot! This is for all the royals out there!  Lorde Looorde. I'm Lorde, ya ya ya-a-a. Sittin' on the toilet thinkin' 'bout how I'm not as rich as other people, ya ya ya.  Yaa ya ya ya, I'll never be, I'll never by royalty. Ya ya ya. But that'd be nice 'cause that'd be a nice fantaasy.  Women's bathrooms smell so nice, ya ya ya. Ya ya ya.  And we'll never be- Lorde Lorde Lor- Lorde flushing- Lordy Lordy Lorde. Lor-uh, okay, uh.  Oh God. Sorry.  Uh hold on. Hang on, uh. 
"
5,5,Stan,"Come on, guys, we're getting to the bottom of this.  'Scuse us.
"
12,3,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, kids, we have something very serious we need to discuss today, hm'kay? It appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves. Some kids call it ""The Choking Game"", hm'kay but, but choking yourself is bad. Hm'kay? Don-, don't do that. Hm'kay?
"
7,10,Stan,"...Yeah, or we just go to Country Kitchen Buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors can't get in.
"
8,1,Stan,"Hm, this doesn't seem to be the right way. My ninja sense is telling me we might be heading in the wrong direction.
"
10,3,Cartman,"Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! 
"
13,11,Stan,"Sweet! 
"
8,8,Randy,"You're crazy!! A d-a douche is at least clean!
"
3,2,Stan,"He just... ignited.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
1,5,Stan,"You can't just leave me here alone.
"
5,11,Cartman,"He's faaahn.
"
10,4,Cartman,"No! No, I hate Family Guy!! 
"
6,9,Stan,"He's definitely lost it
"
13,14,Stan,"Well if you don't swim in you're gonna die!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
7,7,Randy,"It's in God's hand now.  Stand aside, everyone! 
"
10,9,Stan,"Oh God!
"
3,12,Randy,"Here's their van! Here's their van!
"
4,3,Randy,"Huh?
"
8,3,Cartman,"Yes. A little too quiet.
"
18,8,Kyle,"All right McNuggets!  Did we pick the right rooster or what?!
"
5,11,Kyle,"Is it cold in here? I realize we're in the mountains, but do we have to freeze to death?
"
13,8,Cartman,"What if you didn't have to give it up?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Not, not like that?
"
2,5,Stan,"Dammit, we lost one already!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmuuhh!  Coodalah Timmuh!
"
15,8,Kyle,"Yeah yeah, ahh I'll be right there.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Fellas! Don't you see? This proves my point. We have to elevate our ideas up, not down.
"
12,1,Kyle,"I'm sorry. I gotta go home. 
"
5,11,Cartman,"Oh!
"
2,17,Cartman,"Aw, man, this sucks! 
"
8,4,Randy,"Stan? Stan?
"
9,6,Butters,"AH- 
"
11,13,Kyle,"Thanks, Mick.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Cool!) 
"
6,16,Butters,"Yeah, I can't believe it!
"
7,13,Randy,"Smoke you know has got to go. You go, you got to know to say the ""no"" to the smoke, you go go..  ... you gotta get it!
"
12,14,Butters,"Mom, Dad!  I changed back!
"
3,6,Stan,"I called you an ass-sucker!
"
17,9,Kyle,"Princess Kenny, I believe it's time we returned the Wizard's hospitality! 
"
15,11,Randy,"Get tickets, Stotch, it's worth it.
"
7,10,Stan,"No. Come on, Dad. Can't you guys do it?
"
1,7,Cartman,"Hey, wait til you see my Halloween costume tomorrow. It kicks ass.
"
3,14,Kyle,"Yeah! You're dressed up like the South.
"
2,4,Kyle,"You stay away from my little brother!
"
6,12,Stan,"Dude, don't you know what this means? You drank Kenny!
"
15,2,Stan,"What's the matter Jimmy? You still seem bummed.
"
11,12,Stan,"...Oh that makes sense.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Whoa, dude.
"
1,13,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
14,5,Randy,"ANYTHING! anything you want Mr. Cruise.
"
9,14,Randy,"No, Stan, you don't understand. I have a disease. Daddy's very sick.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters.
"
11,14,Wendy,"It's too late, Bebe. I've already made a full report and sent a copy to the police. People will know.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Well, sorry, but if we don't want the government treating us like children, we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half.
"
12,2,Cartman,"That's enough to buy slaves!
"
16,12,Cartman,"Hey, this means we can still make the costume contest, you guys!
"
13,13,Wendy,"Hey, what are you doing?
"
15,8,Mr. Garrison,"Sit down boys, we'll talk about this later. Right now we're talking about vaginal warts.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
"
8,3,Cartman,"It's my Mom's new minivan, so I'm the captain, Kyle!
"
10,9,Stan,"Aw Jesus...
"
18,1,Butters,"Happy Deadline Day!
"
5,7,Stan,"How do you feel?
"
1,1,Stan,"Whoa, dude!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Saturday. Last, last Saturday. He's a paraplegic, but it didn't—
"
2,5,Kyle,"Ye-yes.
"
15,14,Cartman,"You have to start doing more, Mom! What are you doing with your time?!
"
1,4,Kyle,"But I never practiced quarterback.
"
7,6,Stan,"No thanks.
"
13,10,Cartman,"You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! 
"
12,13,Wendy,"That's not true, Red. Everyone has something that makes them unique. 
Everyone is special in their own way.
Move to the beat and let your spirit out! 
"
6,17,Mr. Garrison,"Oh no. 
"
1,9,Cartman,"Hey!  What the hell are you doing?  Jewish people can't eat Christmas snow!
"
6,8,Randy,"Gang, I think maybe we, owe God an apology.
"
6,13,Cartman,"There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! 
"
16,2,Cartman,"You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that-  Motherfucker!
"
12,7,Cartman,"All we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us. Then we can say we were inside all along.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Craig, you can watch Red Racer any day of the week!
"
9,10,Stan,"Teacher, our egg is... okay. 
"
15,2,Mr. Mackey,"Attention students, m'kay? There will be a presentation by the special education department in the gymnasium Friday during lunch and recess, m'kay? Attendance to this assembly is mandatory. All students and faculty are required to go. Uh which, which I guess means I gotta suck it too, huh? Uh huh, m'kay.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Ike, can I talk to you? 
"
3,15,Kyle,"I made you out of clay.
"
6,7,Butters,"Ah, I've done it, General Disarray. I've completed my most horrible deed to date.
"
8,4,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Hi, are you Tony? 
"
15,4,Butters,"I don't understand it! An' I'm startin'- uhh, I'm starting to feel angry! Rawr! 
"
16,8,Butters,"Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he's a heck of a player! He's good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.
"
7,11,Kyle,"Oh. Thanks, dude.
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh thank you, commissioner! I'm thrilled to be a part of this! Thanks!
"
4,15,Mr. Mackey,"Now, Eric, all these people came here and paid to send you to camp because they care about you.
"
9,4,Kyle,"You say tomato, but I say Kenny!
"
7,6,Stan,"No! We're not gonna stop playing detectives! We've just gotta find that doll before thos FBI guys do.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Sixty-five... bottles of... beer on the wall. Six- 
"
11,13,Kyle,"You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! 
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"How about tonight, we sneak up to one of their houses, and right on their lawn we'll set fire to a big lowercase ""t""!
"
7,11,Stan,"Cartman, stop it!
"
16,2,Butters,"We aren't makin' that much, fellas.
"
2,12,Cartman,"No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!
"
7,14,Stan,"Bebe, you need to go talk to Wendy for me right now!  All this time I've been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me! Now I realize I need her friends to do it! Tell her I love her!
"
12,1,Kyle,"Yes!!
"
14,6,Randy,"Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you.
"
3,7,Cartman,"Ey! You ate all the pizza!
"
3,2,Stan,"Dad, what are you doin?! You have to get started!
"
2,15,Stan,"Dude, this is creepy.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Wait a minute.  Fried chicken! It's tender and it's fresh!  There's maple syrup... Maple syrup's being put on the chicken!
"
14,2,Butters,"You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
"
3,16,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I'd better book my ass a flight to Vegas! 
"
6,12,Cartman,"What the fuck is closure?!
"
11,14,Butters,"Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! 
"
6,14,Randy,"Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage. 
"
12,6,Randy,"Oh no it wasn't me, it was this spooky ghost! 
"
10,13,Cartman,"Are you spying on me?!
"
9,4,Kyle,"We want all the country to see that Kenny is alive, and in pain!
"
1,2,Kyle,"What was your paper about Wendy?
"
17,10,Wendy,"Yes, I'm... I'm a few steps ahead of that, yes.
"
8,11,Cartman,"And now, for a quick celebrity check, here's Butters Stotch.
"
3,16,Cartman,"And I'm here, Goddess Earthly Delight. So this is the first meeting of our club for teens who have gotten their periods. We're supposed to talk about our periods. And boys. Let's talk about boys first. I think Craig is pretty cool, but I don't think Clyde is very cool.
"
16,3,Stan,"Wow!
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Woohooo!) 
"
15,11,Randy,"Oh don't worry. I've taken care of everything! You're staying the weekend with the Feegans!
"
11,13,Kyle,"Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero.
"
3,2,Stan,"Well, that doesn't matter! I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him.
"
3,11,Cartman,"Oh. We don't know him.
"
15,14,Cartman,"What??  Greeley?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Give me that phone number!
"
2,5,Stan,"Whoa, dude, this is a school? 
"
15,1,Cartman,"An iPad??? 
"
7,14,Kyle,"Okay. Okay, come on you guys. 
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, come on! You all know that pigeon was a total slut.
"
11,10,Stan,"Well he said there was gonna be a- ...that there was... gonna be a-
"
10,1,Kyle,"Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!
"
5,9,Stan,"Dude, looks like we're going tooh... Afghanistan.
"
10,4,Kyle,"That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!
"
13,5,Cartman,"It's just... I don't know what to do about Jimmy. I'm starting to think he might try and Jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke.  I just... need you to teach me some Jew defensive moves, Kyle. Because we really both did come up with it. 
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations.
"
17,2,Stan,"In Minecraft.
"
11,3,Stan,"Yeah... Or you. 
"
6,12,Cartman,"You turned him into a teapot?
"
14,4,Kyle,"Can I come in?
"
6,3,Cartman,"Okay, here's your ticket  and they're gonna have a car waiting for you at the gate in New York. 
"
5,2,Stan,"Jimmy's funny, dude.
"
5,1,Stan,"So?
"
7,15,Kyle,"Got it. 
"
13,13,Cartman,"Good morning students. These are the morning announcements. If you'll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class,  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video.
"
11,12,Butters,"Red suit, white beard... Ssssanta! 
"
15,10,Cartman,"It's okay Mr. Mackey. I'm totally over it.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Oh my God. Token, aren't you stoked?  Aww, that's awesome, Token. I'm happy for you.
"
5,3,Kyle,"Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!
"
15,9,Kyle,"Butters?
"
15,1,Cartman,"Well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner? 'Cause I like to be wined and dined after I've been FUCKED! 
"
2,11,Kyle,"Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
"
5,7,Stan,"My room? Why?
"
6,1,Butters,"Now gosh darnit, my name's not Kenny! Kenny's dead, and you're all gonna have to learn to deal with it!
"
1,8,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell is going on?! 
"
5,11,Cartman,"What?
"
8,11,Kyle,"How do we know which one to use?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Stay by the window! Tell me if anything changes!  I need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance.
"
4,9,Cartman,"And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--
"
6,11,Stan,"Oh my God, our parents are so stupid, dude. 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Don't worry, Nut Gobbler! I'm coming!  Oh Jesus, not now.  Oh boy, this is embarrassing. 
"
8,9,Cartman,"No, but you got everyone all worked up! You're always jealous of the Wall-Mart. You always hated it.
"
18,5,Butters,"NO! There is NO WAY I'm gonna-
"
6,4,Butters,"Hey y-yeah. W-w-we can't let those little baby cows down. Why, they've got no one else to turn to.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay-Mr. Garrison, you're just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your father's sexual abuse, so you switch personalities to Mr. Hat, m'kay?
"
3,2,Cartman,"Oh, Peter. Weak, Peter. Lame. But I'm Jesus, so I'll forgive you, I guess.
"
6,16,Butters,"Oh, Stan!
"
10,9,Kyle,"So then, who was responsible for 9/11?
"
5,1,Kyle,"We think that you might have could it by helping make ""shit"" an everyday word. 
"
6,2,Stan,"Smell what?
"
7,14,Cartman,"Got it. 
"
2,18,Kenny,"(You bastard!)
"
18,1,Stan,"Nah.
"
14,8,Kenny,"(No fucking way!)
"
18,2,Stan,"What do you mean? We have a friend who needs us right now, and we can't let him down. 
"
18,10,Stan,"Dude. You're such a grandpa.
"
2,18,Stan,"No, it isn't!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Egh, because they're poor, Kyle! Poor people don't have anything better to do than piss other people off! Don't you watch Springer?!
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Well yeah, but at least I got rid of all those damn ni-
"
9,7,Jimmy,"...Colfax Point?
"
8,1,Cartman,"I'm gonna get those killer sai.  Look Kenny! There's something even you can afford! A ninja shuriken  for a dollar ninety nine.
"
16,13,Stan,"Jesus!
"
3,4,Stan,"You're on, fatass! 
"
3,13,Kyle,"What's your name? 
"
3,6,Stan,"Ohh, dude, get me out of here!
"
13,8,Kyle,"Hey! What the hell are you doing inside my little brother?!
"
18,8,Randy,"People are going to do it, Sharon. And it's up to the professionals to make sure it's handled the right way. Hoh!  Oh my gosh! 
"
12,14,Cartman,"Yeah, now get out of here.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"No?
"
3,6,Cartman,"Your Honor, my lawyer is just parking the car. He should be here any second.
"
7,8,Randy,"Oh my God, it's on fire! 
"
10,4,Cartman,"Oh... yes, yes. Um  hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-
"
3,1,Stan,"We're sinking.
"
16,3,Cartman,"What? Let me see that. 
"
17,9,Kyle,"Stan, it's me.
"
7,3,Stan,"D'you think that's enough?
"
3,14,Kyle,"Yeah, but you know? I think you've learned something today. You've learned that you can't rewrite history.  You see, history is forever,  and everything happens for a reason.  Sure, you can try and change the past, but usually you kno-
"
13,5,Cartman,"Dude, if I'm trying to be creative, I can't eat fruit. Doesn't your mom have something more substantial to eat?
"
5,1,Kyle,"It's just a marketing ploy by the network. Like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with Terrance and Phillip?
"
6,12,Stan,"Where's Kenny??
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
10,8,Stan,"Oh my God, he killed Kenny!
"
7,9,Stan,"Boy, I'll say!
"
8,5,Butters,"Yeah! And if Cartman ever messes with me again, I'm gonna show that video to everybody! Then I'll have my revenge, boy howdy!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Why?
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Out on the balcony, when Reginald kissed Diana's lips, her knees went weak. Slowly, he pulled her top down, exposing her soft, unyielding breasts
Oh yeah, now this is getting good 
Just the sight of those breasts made Reginald's penis very hard.
His penis was of considerable size, and now beads of sweat slowly ran down his
penis, making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out of the pool. It was a fantastic penis, that seemed as strong as a horse's leg, yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk. What a grand, grand penis. Diana's nipples
Uh, let's see...  Diana's nipples...  Oh, writer's block, writer's block! Hmmm. Crap! I'm stuck.  Oh well, maybe that's enough writing for today, Mr. Hat.
"
16,6,Cartman,"I brought it up because you already brought it up!
"
13,7,Cartman,"And a tricky lahty do!
"
1,4,Cartman,"He still looks pretty gay to me.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Okay. Okay, the shot is finally set up. Now shoot the O mouth for two frames. 
"
17,2,Butters,"Yeah. And then my dad just went berserk and came over and picked me up and threw me down a well!  I was trapped down there all night!
"
6,2,Stan,"Uhh... no.
"
6,6,Butters,"Oh yes. Every living creature and every sacred building will soon be under leagues and leagues of cold and dark water. And there is nothing you can do to stop me! General Disarray, begin the flooding of Earth!  You brought this upon yourselves! You made the outcasts of the world! Now watch! Watch as your precious planet drowns! Watch! 
"
16,12,Stan,"You have to get me to my friends! They aren't safe! 
"
2,17,Stan,"Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about. 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Alright! Kenny's in, you guys! Tits!
"
3,10,Kyle,"God damnit! 
"
15,13,Stan,"Dude!
"
7,3,Kyle,"Oh. Okay. Thanks.
"
16,9,Cartman,"Oh my God you guys, look at this!  Candy Corn Oreos. Oreos with candy corn filling.  Holy hell yes!
"
8,7,Kyle,"All you ever do is talk about your balls!
"
11,1,Cartman,"Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical!  Oh!
"
12,8,Kyle,"I'm sorry.  I I'm sorry, I can't do this.  I'm not doing this. 
"
1,12,Kenny,"(Oh no! I have got to stay away fro-aaagh!)  (Ugh!)
"
10,1,Stan,"Chef, we love you.
"
13,1,Stan,"A B.J.?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Wow, w-we've got to do something, Timmy. We've gotta get the Crips and Bloods to sstop fighting. I bet if we could just get them together... but how? Wu-wait a minute! I've got it! A lock-in at the rec center! We did it for our church once. All we do is rent out the rec center overnight. They lock the doors so nobody can leave, and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk.
"
2,7,Stan,"Cartman, no! 
"
16,2,Stan,"I'm not joking.  Do it.
"
12,8,Cartman,"God damn it Butters, what did I say about shooting guys in the dick?!
"
17,6,Cartman,"No! No, Kyle, you said that it's never for the best. Remember that? And you're right. You're right, Kyle!
"
6,9,Cartman,"How many hats have you made?
"
11,3,Cartman,"All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Mister, you can't do this to us!
"
10,13,Cartman,"This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Yeah! You ripped off our idea!
"
6,16,Randy,"You really did a nice job, Eric. 
"
4,9,Kyle,"Wow. I feel so rejected.
"
1,6,Stan,"Goddammit!
"
5,10,Kenny,"(You've ever done?!)
"
10,14,Stan,"Get near the puck! 
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Oh okay, okay, I just wanna sleep now.)
"
11,2,Cartman,"And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. 
"
2,7,Stan,"What time is it?
"
16,6,Cartman,"Ziplining. Hell yeah.
"
13,1,Kyle,"Kenny, aren't you a little young for this?
"
1,4,Cartman,"No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That's why he smote those sodomies in France.
"
5,3,Stan,"No way!
"
9,3,Cartman,"From now on, we are an entertainment team, Token. You just do all the singing, all the performing and all the entertaining,and leave the rest to us.
"
12,11,Kyle,"I don't know. It's old.
"
7,8,Kyle,"I thought of it two days ago!
"
9,4,Cartman,"Oh yeah! Oh yeah, baby! Who the man? Who the man?
"
4,13,Stan,"Cartman!
"
7,6,Kyle,"What?  What??
"
3,6,Stan,"""Island Of Misfit Mascots Commune"". This must be the place. 
"
14,14,Randy,"Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking!  I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. 
"
17,7,Stan,"Then join us! We need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall!
"
1,4,Kyle,"You're gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.
"
4,9,Randy,"Who are they? 
"
2,16,Randy,"Now, Sharon, don't overreact. Maybe Stan didn't go to Cartman's Grandmother's. Maybe he just ran away or got kidnapped or something.
"
10,6,Kenny,"(No, nothing!) 
"
16,7,Cartman,"What the? ...Oh, Token's shy. Oh my God, that is adorable.
"
3,12,Stan,"How should we split up?
"
14,10,Kyle,"Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver.  Look at me!  Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? 
"
10,9,Stan,"It was all planned out!
"
11,10,Butters,"Waaahaa!
"
7,7,Randy,"Gerald, twenty-six thousand-!
"
17,6,Kyle,"I... I know.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Aw, come on now, this is just getting silly! 
"
11,2,Butters,"A surprise? What is it?
"
16,8,Randy,"I don't see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool.
"
12,6,Randy,"Kids, get back in the car. We can go to the Mac store.
"
1,4,Kyle,"Chef.
"
2,3,Stan,"That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.
"
5,6,Stan,"Heh, heh.  Sorry.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I'm just sayin'.
"
2,5,Stan,"ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
"
18,9,Kyle,"And this kid is watching Cartman commenting on people commenting on Dragon Age.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Ey! You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kick you square in the nuh-  I'm gonyanya, uhnyuh, uhnyuuh, nyaahh 
"
1,12,Cartman,"...and I told him. I said, 'Kyle, I will kick you in the nuts.' But he didn't give it back to me. So I kicked him square - in the nuts, and he cried - like Nancy Kerrigan!
"
7,9,Butters,"Two billion, three hundred and thirty one million dollars.
"
3,11,Stan,"Sally Struthers is saving us!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Fine, Mom.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Hoh, boy, I'm gonna need some more smack.
"
12,10,Stan,"Yeah!
"
18,10,Randy,"Look, I don't know what they're up to, but these people have something much darker planned!
"
18,7,Stan,"Come on, we're going to Butters' house! 
"
7,5,Butters,"Hey, a big limousine just pulled up in front of the school!
"
3,13,Butters,"Wewell, come on. We gotta buy us some more duct tape.
"
13,14,Kyle,"I'm thinking about it!
"
10,7,Cartman,"Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face.
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"Thank you, Pioneer Paul.  All right, kids, this is a big place, so I want everyone to pick a partner to hold hands with. 
"
6,3,Stan,"Hey Kenny! 
"
8,8,Cartman,"Hello, Clyde.
"
13,4,Cartman,"No! No! As a matter of fact, I will not hold! I've been on hold for thirty-five minutes! Well we want some Goddamned answers, that's what we want! Like why did you show that smut instead of the Terrance and Phillip conclusion, you asshole?!
"
15,1,Cartman,"Mom, do not screw me over again! If I take that thing to school, everyone is gonna think I'm a poverty-stricken asshole!
"
14,8,Butters,"I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Cool! This game rules!
"
6,4,Cartman,"All right, how 'bout this? You guys have all the leverage and we have nothing. So how about we give you one calf... -
"
10,2,Kyle,"We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... 
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Well, well, well! Guess we learned something new about you, Jimbo, you freakin' fag! You wanna make out or something?
"
14,4,Cartman,"Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Heh-aaaaaah!
"
8,4,Randy,"What?
"
17,6,Stan,"Hey Kyle.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Nah. Dude, I totally spaced it. 
"
12,7,Cartman,"... Oh dude, laaame.
"
5,5,Cartman,"Aw, dude, gay!
"
12,9,Cartman,"My mom has muscular dystrophy. In her boobs.
"
18,2,Stan,"Dad, who's the guy at work that knows Lorde? Let me go! DAD!
"
4,17,Cartman,"Anything for more presents!
"
1,11,Kyle,"I've been thinking, Wendy. This whole outcome is pretty strange.
"
8,9,Randy,"Checkout line... They had these... little stickers filled with glitter! They were only ninety nine cents for 15 of them. I couldn't resist! Do you want one?  Here. It's a little turtle. 
"
15,5,Cartman,"But then, who played at my eighth birthday party?
"
5,4,Cartman,"What?!
"
8,6,Kyle,"Mr. Jefferson!
"
2,11,Cartman,"It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
"
18,8,Cartman,"At one point, Kenny actually polymorphed the dude into a blue frog with an instant attack card. It was carnage, bro!
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
4,15,Kyle,"Aw, dude, check this out. 
"
11,10,Kyle,"Are you gonna take us somewhere or not?!
"
4,3,Randy,"Alright, we've gotta figure out what to do. I'm gonna go wake her up.  Hello? Mrs.... Mrs., Old Romanian Woman?  Ma'am? 
"
6,16,Cartman,"Okay, very nice, very nice. Oh wait, uh, God-damnit! Felipe!  The classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents' bedroom! The living room is supposed to be all baby green poop!
"
7,9,Cartman,"All right. Nice, fellas. Nice. 
I need you in my life, Jesus.
I can't live without you, Jesus
And I just want to feel you deep inside me, Jesus.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Alright, alright, I drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter.
"
3,15,Kyle,"Oh, hi Dad.
"
11,8,Kyle,"No, I- I beat you!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Hey there fellas.
"
1,1,Cartman,"But mom, I don't want to spend time with my little friends--
"
1,5,Stan,"Yeah, when does Mother Nature go from beautiful to ugly?
"
11,5,Stan,"All right, can you explain to me what's going on?
"
3,14,Stan,"Don't touch me. 
"
15,7,Randy,"I'd love to. I'm not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I'm still cool. 
"
15,14,Cartman,"Will you stop with the Penn State jokes?! All you're doing is taking topical and revamping old Catholic jokes!
"
11,9,Stan,"What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!
"
9,3,Kyle,"Oh crap!
"
9,12,Randy,"Oh Jesus, the answer is no, Stanley.
"
6,4,Butters,"Oh, sweet Jesus. Uh, what do I do?
"
14,10,Randy,"Yes, it's me, Stan.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends! 
"
4,2,Cartman,"I got it!
"
7,12,Randy,"Let me handle this, Sharon. You gotta put these cult people in their place or else they never stop! I'm gonna go kick this Mr. Garrison's ass!  This, Mr. Garrison is, is a white guy, right?
"
14,4,Stan,"...Um, no?
"
4,7,Stan,"You have to be drinking milk for that to happen.
"
16,4,Cartman,"You're wrong, Kyle! God is not a dick! 
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, he says Pablo here will take you on a rainforest tour.
"
13,11,Stan,"Jesus Christ!  We've gotta get something to shoot 'em with!
"
3,9,Kyle,"He was huge.
"
9,6,Kyle,"It was Cartman having Butters apologize for him.
"
9,3,Stan,"Whoa whoa, wait, wait. ...where's Wing? 
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Well crap, that didn't work.
"
13,11,Stan,"Kenny? You don't care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered?
"
7,1,Kyle,"Other than his monstrous size.
"
7,12,Randy,"God-damned religious kooks! Tell my son what to believe, will you?! We'll see how you like my fist in your ass! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?
"
9,5,Randy,"I'm standin' right here! How do you wanna handle it?
"
1,12,Stan,"Yeah. I'm sure glad that's over with.
"
3,16,Cartman,"Hold your horses, guys. This is very important for mature people.  Let's see. Offers complete protection during heavy flow, hm.  Lessee, might slow stoppage of vaginal chunks, eh.  Oh, this one's got wings, you guys!
"
3,4,Kyle,"So, do you agree to fight him after school?
"
6,12,Cartman,"Stop it! Where am I, you guys? Oh God! 
"
15,8,Cartman,"Then why are they sayin' that gettin' vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded?
"
17,2,Cartman,"Son of a bitch!  Don't you think there are enough griefers in the world without our parents being shown this stuff?!
"
2,3,Kyle,"What's it say?
"
1,2,Cartman,"Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcake!
"
4,4,Kyle,"The Declaration of Independence?
"
14,4,Kyle,"...What?
"
16,9,Cartman,"Dude, how come when we play baseball I have to be the catcher? 
"
9,7,Kyle,"Well, what's the point? Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.
"
1,1,Cartman,"I would if I could, you son of a bitch!
"
12,9,Cartman,"You know what she did? She apologized and begged me not to fight her. I said ""Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone."" But she wouldn't. That's how desperate she is. Man you have to do something, Stan. You have to be a fuckin' man and forbid her from fighting, so she has a way-  Oh, that's where I put those.  Anyway, Stan, you've got to put a stop to this fight. Wendy's stuck and she needs you.
"
10,12,Cartman,"No...  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
"
8,11,Jimmy,"I wonder... oo-oo.. w-why?
"
13,11,Butters,"I watch their show all the time. And, they take volunteers.
"
12,8,Kyle,"Why would Spielberg and Lucas do this?!
"
15,4,Cartman,"There, you see? My wiener isn't 1.2 inches, it's 1.4!  What, Red?! You're all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys'?! I don't care!  Clearly I'm very happy with the size of my wiener, or else why would I have called for a new measurement, and for this poster to be put up at all?! Don't forget that this was all my idea!
"
7,1,Stan,"Dad?
"
2,10,Stan,"Thanks a lot, Frida!
"
10,12,Cartman,"All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right?  I think I figured out how to do it.
"
7,10,Randy,"Oh.  Wait a minute. If all the seniors in town are at a meeting, that means that when the meeting gets out...
"
10,7,Stan,"Dude, have you lost more weight?
"
15,7,Stan,"Kyle?
"
3,7,Cartman,"No, Kitty! I don't have anything!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Yeah you! In the park this morning?! ""I know, let's all go ziplining! We've never done that before!""
"
14,7,Cartman,"If in fact the Jews truly are shapeshifters, and I believe I've presented enough evidence here to prove that they are, then we must unite as a species to fight them and stop their plan of global domination and the control of our freedom. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"...Um, where is this videotape, Butters?
"
10,13,Cartman,"I got it! I got the Wii!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Yeah, and I'm not gonna take my friends for granted ever again.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?
"
7,8,Kyle,"Cool.
"
5,14,Butters,"Ye-!  wait, what?
"
12,13,Stan,"Yeah, just go in at recess and shoot some ball with the team, God damn it!
"
12,7,Butters,"I'm gonna fall! 
"
7,1,Stan,"Uh, Earth?
"
2,8,Cartman,"Nuh-uh.
"
16,9,Stan,"Yeah dude. It's really serious.
"
13,7,Cartman,"This... is your pirate boat? Dude, the FUCK! Alright, seriously you guys? What kind of pirates are you? I mean, really? The FUCK, dude, the FUCK?!
"
1,13,Cartman,"Mom? Can I ask you a question?
"
1,3,Stan,"Maybe it's Scuzzlebutt coming to weave us into wicker baskets.
"
16,13,Stan,"Well... we can't just let that guy get away with taking everyone's money.
"
2,11,Cartman,"What?!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Don't worry. I have a plan. 
"
1,12,Cartman,"Never! I'll get that triangle if it's the last thing I do!
"
18,8,Cartman,"We can't tell you, bro. It's like, hardcore underground shit.
"
13,8,Kyle,"What the hell are we going to do??
"
10,10,Cartman,"I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.
"
5,7,Cartman,"Yeah, I guess they thought we were cool, so they showed us how to do it—hey come here, dog. Dog, come here! 
"
7,9,Cartman,"Heheheheheh heheheheheh.
"
6,2,Randy,"Don't listen to 'em, let's just go!
"
13,7,Cartman,"Oh, excellent! They're taking us to a ship. Once we commandeer our vessel the plundering will be easy indeed, lads. 
"
6,2,Butters,"Do you guys smell that? It smells bad out here, too. I'm starting to think this whole town smells like doodoo.
"
12,11,Randy,"Sharon, you're gonna be really glad we have all this footage of the family someday. 
"
13,9,Kyle,"Butters, what's happened to you?
"
7,15,Kyle,"Well come on! 
"
6,15,Stan,"No no, he's trapped in Cartman's body.
"
5,8,Stan,"What's that?
"
6,4,Kyle,"You guys, check this out! 
"
11,14,Butters,"Neato!
"
2,18,Stan,"Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!
"
3,13,Cartman,"How come you don't go to school?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Yuh, you mean it?
"
9,1,Kyle,"Yeah, but it was totally worth it. 
"
3,5,Cartman,"You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me...  Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor!
"
14,14,Randy,"Back from where?
"
2,17,Kyle,"Woohoo! 
"
2,7,Stan,"Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Daaad, when's it gonna stop raining frogs?
"
15,11,Randy,"Oh you fucking pervert!
"
5,14,Butters,"...No.
"
5,1,Cartman,"My house, too?
"
16,8,Cartman,"Youuu save it all?
"
5,5,Kyle,"Please, you guys. This is for Earth Day.  You care about Mother Earth, don't you?
"
12,11,Kenny,"(I think we're fucked!)
"
1,1,Stan,"Dude, like Chef says, I've gotta get a piece of lovin' while the gettin's hot. 
"
9,9,Kyle,"The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That's retarded.
"
2,15,Kyle,"You know what I like best about you? You don't say, ""hella,"" like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! 
"
8,2,Timmy,"Oowrrr! Timmih! Livilaye!
"
2,10,Kyle,"You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
"
1,6,Cartman,"Hey, you're gonna miss it Kenny.
"
10,6,Cartman,"You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. 
"
9,8,Kyle,"...Cartman?
"
16,4,Kyle,"Get. Outta here! 
"
8,11,Cartman,"We're in fourth grade, Jimmy. We don't even know what ethical means.
"
10,6,Cartman,"I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!
"
10,3,Randy,"Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!
"
2,4,Kyle,"Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!
"
3,17,Cartman,"Uh-oh. 
"
1,12,Stan,"My mom always said there were no monsters, but there are, aren't there, Chef?
"
10,1,Kyle,"You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.
"
3,12,Stan,"Yeah, dude. It's right over there.
"
7,7,Randy,"Oooo, the nickel slots! You might win the thirty-dollar jackpot! Ahh, women, huh? God I hate 'em. 
"
15,5,Kyle,"So what are you doing?!
"
2,12,Randy,"Truth or Dare?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! 
"
7,7,Stan,"It's all right, dad.
"
3,9,Kyle,"I can't watch the meteor shower with you, Kenny. I have to go to Jewbilee.
"
15,7,Kenny,"(Get him!)
"
14,3,Cartman,"Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!
"
6,13,Kyle,"Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
"
2,9,Kyle,"You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Are we getting close?
"
6,8,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
18,6,Stan,"Your turn, Grandpa. If you roll a five or a six, you can kill these zombies. 
"
5,1,Kyle,"They're gonna say ""shit"" on television?
"
5,8,Kyle,"Seven and a half.
"
16,7,Kyle,"Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball? That's perfect! Thanks, you guys!
"
3,14,Randy,"Uh, the only thing we have to do is get home before our wives leave us.
"
7,3,Stan,"Fine! But we'll have the last laugh tonight, artwhore!
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Twig, is that you?  Mis-Mr. Twig?  Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No!  Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!
"
16,6,Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAAH!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Was it that I was ugly?!
"
12,8,Stan,"There was nothing we could do, Kyle!  There was nothing we could do. We had to get out of there.
"
9,12,Kyle,"Yeah dude, nothing fun is free.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Hey yeah! What's that song she always sings? There's got to be a morning after.
"
12,1,Stan,"...What?
"
6,1,Kyle,"Tha- that's diarrhea.
"
8,11,Stan,"We're hopelessly stuck, completely out of ideas.
"
4,8,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, yeah.
"
3,15,Kyle,"with dreidel I shall play.
"
5,10,Kyle,"Eh-heh. L-look, if you want an explanation, you you'd better go to Kenny's house.
"
8,11,Cartman,"And I'm Rick Cartman.
"
9,9,Butters,"Ah. Uhh, could I hold that?
"
11,4,Stan,"Russian?
"
3,14,Cartman,"Oh, really? I'm pretty sure I just did.
"
10,10,Cartman,"What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee.
"
15,4,Butters,"Homework! I just don't get it! That is the fourth time I've calculated, and it's below average! I thought I was hung, but according to my T.M.I., I have a micropenis! 
"
13,13,Stan,"Dude, what happened? You're not doing the morning announcements anymore?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Moooommm!
"
18,10,Randy,"Oh my God...
"
12,11,Kyle,"Um I think we're just heading deeper into the mountains.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Oh, stop it, Cartman! You didn't learn anything! Not a God-damned thing!
"
7,14,Butters,"O-kay!
"
6,13,Randy,"We think our boys might be showing other chiildren a, uh... pornographic tape.
"
15,9,Cartman,"At least I have an asshole, Kyle! 
"
3,8,Butters,"Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?
"
5,14,Butters,"Wah I have to get to South Park. Eh, if you give me a ride, I could pay you the four dollars I made at the titty bar.
"
16,13,Butters,"Wu-what sound?
"
3,8,Butters,"Hey, that's because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. 
"
2,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well, we just need to make some posters, nkay? Hand out brochures, onkay? That way, the public can know what the chldren look like and can call in if thry're spotted, m'kay?
"
16,3,Cartman,"How is this Kyle? This good? 
"
16,7,Cartman,"That-s al- Oh, Cupid Me!  Sick! What the fuck have you been eating?!
"
13,2,Cartman,"Wha, what?
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh uluh-livin' a lie!
"
4,17,Stan,"That's not me, that's you!
"
14,6,Kyle,"You gotta be kidding me!
"
14,9,Kyle,"You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage!  You've got cabbage in your muff!  You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! 
"
10,9,Stan,"Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you??
"
17,10,Wendy,"Ah, ah I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I have been jelly.
"
17,7,Cartman,"But my friends, we must still find others who will fight by our side! Are there no other factions we can call to our aid?
"
2,17,Cartman,"What now?
"
3,10,Cartman,"C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha--
"
6,1,Cartman,"Alright, I think it's in. 
"
2,14,Cartman,"What?!
"
6,17,Randy,"Christmas is ruined again! 
"
8,12,Butters,"Uh, well huh, how am I supposed to make that kind of money??
"
8,13,Cartman,"Not now! The nurse is gonna walk in any minute with my lunch.
"
12,9,Stan,"Yeah?
"
15,9,Butters,"All week long, bossman say
"
2,2,Stan,"Oh boy.  Bleech! 
"
1,11,Kyle,"Yeah, you're not a lesbian, fatass.
"
7,8,Randy,"Please, girlfriend. You look like some kind of Little Orphan Annie nightmare.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Yeah, they've been poppin' up all over the neighborhood lately. Ms. Nelson next door had seven hippies in her basement; they usually live in colonies.  Hm, I don't like the sound of that. Could I take a look in your attic?
"
4,3,Stan,"Hey! We wanna see the quintuplets!
"
2,1,Cartman,"He's my father?! 
"
16,13,Cartman,"I can't believe we all got duped. I've been wearin' this stupid things for months! I feel like such a tool.
"
2,12,Cartman,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
12,10,Kyle,"Sir? Sir, can we talk to you for just a second?
"
9,6,Butters,"Well, there's this ghost, see? Only it probably isn't a ghost, ih-it's just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I'm supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin' the Earth, even though I know that I'm most likely just completely insane.
"
3,10,Randy,"...Are those good moral values?
"
9,11,Kyle,"We're gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!
"
3,4,Kenny,"(I don't wanna take shop class!) 
"
14,6,Randy,"We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke.
"
6,12,Kyle,"You did, dude! You drank his whole body!
"
3,10,Randy,"My God, you're right.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yeah. 
"
6,1,Kyle,"Twenty-two point three years. That's how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.
"
1,12,Kyle,"Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would shut... up.
"
13,1,Kyle,"Kenny, we know you really like this girl, but...
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh brother.  Kenny, would you please climb that ladder and take down the star above the stage?  And be careful not to fall in that little pool below you, Kenny, the shark for the third act is in there.
"
12,6,Randy,"Well there certainly ain't none here! Look, maybe it's time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!
"
14,14,Randy,"If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan.
"
13,8,Cartman,"A child... and a female. And white.
"
9,2,Cartman,"I... don't want you to worry about me, Clyde Frog.  Hey! You're the best stuffed animal I've ever had. 
"
16,10,Cartman,"Kyle, have you stopped to think that maybe the sex wasn't consensual?
"
5,8,Stan,"It... it was right here.
"
15,9,Butters,"Meheecan
"
9,11,Kyle,"Is that an umbrella you're using?
"
13,10,Kyle,"Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Well, a little, yes.
"
7,15,Kenny,"(And I'm not gonna have last 5 days without death...) 
"
9,11,Cartman,"Red Power!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Juden!
"
12,2,Butters,"Not me! I'm a squirrel!
"
13,10,Kyle,"I'll fight anytime, anywhere!
"
14,2,Kyle,"Why the hell was this book banned?!
"
3,10,Cartman,"Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Yeah. See you later, heh. Ho,  huhuh, he, haha.
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"What?! What the hell are you talking about?! I am not gay.
"
9,14,Randy,"You heard what he said!  The higher power didn't cure me! I'm powerless again!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Live together!
"
11,1,Randy,"Okay. 
"
9,7,Butters,"Lu lu lu, I've got some...  Some... uh, some uh... some, uh... Uuuhhh... Oh no!  No no noho noo! 
"
7,6,Cartman,"Oh okay.  Okay, retard, you really don't know how to make semen come out?!
"
10,4,Kyle,"Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!
"
8,14,Stan,"Go away! Shoo! 
"
7,14,Stan,"She's a continuing source of inspiration to me.
"
8,14,Kyle,"No.  No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!
"
6,8,Cartman,"Ih... in our... butt?
"
11,12,Cartman,"Where are you going?!
"
3,4,Stan,"Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna have my uncle Jimbo teach Tweek how to box!
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"...So?
"
10,10,Cartman,"You're goin' with Christ! 
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I have to know why! Right here and now—we're gonna talk about this!
"
16,6,Stan,"You see guys? This is gonna be sweet after all.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hello, puhree! Puhree hello! Hello, sucky-sucky! Hello, puhree!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Ey! I need to use the phone!
"
10,8,Cartman,"Yes!
"
12,8,Stan,"So, what now?
"
12,10,Kyle,"But where are we gonna get the money to buy costumes and and the instruments? 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Hey, yeah!  Ow!
"
6,13,Butters,"Now wees hases it! 
"
8,10,Stan,"Shelly?
"
2,11,Cartman,"Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!
"
8,9,Stan,"Butters? 
"
16,14,Butters,"Well, mmmaybe Cartman had a good reason.
"
14,9,Stan,"Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Alright, ""start your engine."" What's that mean?
"
10,8,Butters,"I don't play World of Warcraft.
"
11,7,Stan,"Are you the head of Homeless Studies?
"
7,11,Cartman,"What what what?
"
4,1,Stan,"I saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it.
"
6,16,Butters,"Well, studying is the golden key to the imposing door of success.
"
4,4,Stan,"Huh? No, we're not actually gonna take that stuff.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Aw aw guys, come on!
"
4,17,Cartman,"Aw, Jesus Christ! I'm going back to bed. 
"
6,16,Randy,"Don't be silly, Stan. You don't wanna go through life without one of your hands. 
"
1,4,Stan,"Wow, cool!
"
16,12,Randy,"How many uh, how many copies of Meet The Fockers do we have in stock, Shelly?
"
8,11,Cartman,"Oh man, this is so great! We, we worked so hard to be on top! Oh, oh come'ere you! 
"
5,7,Wendy,"Don't you know that without wearing a condom you could get a disease?
"
15,11,Randy,"I can't!
"
7,14,Butters,"Hey, hey sweetie, I was thinking tonight you could come over and we could watch The Exorcist on DVD.
"
1,11,Stan,"Ploozer gift, ploozer gift.
"
1,7,Cartman,"Remember candy, focus on the candy.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Uuuh. Well, the truth is, we didn't write that paper last time. 
"
6,16,Kyle,"What if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Brrr brrr! Brrr brrr! Oh, excuse me, everyone. That's my cell phone.  Hello? Oh yes, hi, Colonel Sanders! Yes, I'm doing great, but you know, heh, someone at American Idol doesn't know who Wing is.
"
14,1,Butters,"I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??
"
5,11,Kyle,"I'm ba-ack.
"
7,13,Kyle,"You just hate smoking, so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you. And that's called fascism, you tubby asshole!
"
12,5,Cartman,"How do I reeeach these keeeeds?!  Just before the last Super Bowl, Bill Beelichick gathered his football players and said, ""Let's win this one for real. Just this one time. Let's not cheat."" You know what happened?  They lost.  Even if you feel all eyes are upon you, you cannot give up on chea-ting! Or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives.
"
3,16,Stan,"Thanks a lot, Dr. Mephesto. You're the best! 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?
"
11,5,Randy,"Just get out of here! 
"
1,1,Wendy,"Here, Stan. This is for you. 
"
1,10,Kyle,"Kick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.
"
1,7,Stan,"Hey, where's Kyle?
"
8,4,Kyle,"Dude, that is a sweet RC car!
"
9,1,Stan,"Oh Jesus, he's about to play! 
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Besides teaching?
"
9,5,Randy,"Guess that's my guy. I can take him, no problem. 
"
15,2,Stan,"What the hell are they gonna do to us?
"
4,7,Stan,"Nobody wants to listen, Kenny.
"
5,14,Butters,"We won't know until we're at Bennigan's.
"
7,11,Stan,"Yeah.
"
14,10,Stan,"Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!
"
16,3,Kyle,"Yep, that's great. 
"
17,10,Butters,"That's Lisa Berger?
"
2,14,Kyle,"Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!
"
12,13,Kyle,"I swear
"
15,1,Stan,"Genius Leslie, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.
"
3,13,Stan,"Dude, he's kicking the crap out of Kyle!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Ugh. UGHuh.  I can't do it! This is waaay too much material for a nine-year-old! 
"
6,6,Kyle,"Yeah! Isn't this great?!
"
1,5,Stan,"Shut up Cartman!
"
3,14,Cartman,"I'm playing the drum.
"
5,1,Randy,"Shipped. He said ""shipped"".
"
16,13,Stan,"I don't know,  I just like it.
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"Well of course Stanley, what is it?
"
15,10,Kyle,"One.  Two. Three! 
"
5,11,Stan,"Yeah. He'll be waaay better off back at home. 
"
17,9,Cartman,"Dude! Dude!
"
12,7,Butters,"Yeah, it sure has.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
1,1,Stan,"Dude, Kenny is dead!  See?
"
1,4,Stan,"Sparky, bad dog!
"
6,14,Butters,"Yes sir.
"
6,10,Wendy,"Oh, no, that's okay Bebe. You might trip and then we'd be sucked into your huge gaping vagina like ants into a vacuum cleaner.  Slut.  Slut.
"
8,9,Kyle,"But nobody wants a Wall-Mart here!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Roll camera!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Damnit man, this is not the time for negotiations! There's a little doll in there about to have her head twisted off!
"
11,3,Kenny,"(What? Fuck you!)
"
16,8,Randy,"Thanks, Jim. 'Cause it's totally what I intended. You know, when I came up with the idea I was sure it was gonna end up like this.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Hm huheh, that's okay. 
"
7,1,Stan,"You mean, at some point in this doctor's life he decided he wanted to work on people's buttholes.
"
4,10,Kenny,"(What??)
"
11,12,Butters,"Wuh, what can I do?
"
18,3,Randy,"Yeah, listen. I don't know if I can keep doing this. My wife is starting to suspect something. I just had to tell her I like the way fishnets feel.
"
4,15,Kenny,"(I'm not eatin' that!)
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
11,10,Cartman,"I believe a serious blow to democracy has just been dealt.  A travesty has occurred, and I want justice! Kyle Broflovski did willingly and knowingly sign a contract, and yet, to date, he has made no effort, nor does he show any intention, of ever sucking my balls!  I've given him ample time to fulfill his obligation, and he has thus refused. I stand before you with dry balls, Your Honor. I've provided witnesses, collected testimonials, and still, my balls remain dry. I want what I'm entitled to!
"
13,2,Kyle,"Dude, everyone's trying to figure out who you are.
"
16,1,Randy,"Aw, damn it.  He, hey officer.
"
1,2,Cartman,"Yes ma'am. I'm gonna be on television, I'm gonna be on television.
"
9,5,Kyle,"This is it, Stan. If you strike this kid out, we all get to go home.
"
11,14,Stan,"Are you sure you're okay with this, Kyle?
"
2,16,Kyle,"Good for you, Charlie!
"
11,10,Kyle,"Let's just get this over with!
"
6,12,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell's wrong with you?!
"
6,17,Cartman,"They don't have Christmas there, guys. We have to give it to them.
"
6,10,Butters,"Huh Bebe's cool, huh. Huh, fellas?
"
3,13,Stan,"Do you wanna go have some cake with me, Mark? 
"
10,8,Randy,"World of Warcraft! I need to play!
"
4,6,Butters,"Well, sure, u-uh I'm a team player-uh, I guess.
"
17,10,Wendy,"That's fine!  People can call me whatever names they want to! I don't care! There is a cancer in our country, and I'm not going to rest until Photoshopped images are required to be labeled for what they are! Fake! And nothing in this world is going to stop me!
"
15,10,Cartman,"That. Was. Amazing.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Oh, that's such a democratic thing to say, Kyle. What if I were to tell you that I have something in my room that could change the entire election? 
"
5,1,Cartman,"Kenny's got it. heh heh.
"
2,16,Stan,"I don't want your lame-ass supper!
"
7,3,Kyle,"How dare she talk to us like that?!
"
2,11,Kyle,"What does that do?
"
16,2,Cartman,"No, dude, it's... badass.
"
11,3,Kyle,"You know what? I'll bet it was you!
"
5,11,Cartman,"Maybe we'll have to send him to concentration camp. AWGH! Damnit, damnit, damnit!
"
8,12,Butters,"Oh hamburgers!
"
3,8,Stan,"Mom, go look outside.
"
6,8,Stan,"Chef! What would a priest want to stick up my butt?
"
2,11,Cartman,"I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch.
"
2,12,Stan,"We're working on it.
"
9,9,Butters,"Huh? Oh nothin'. Hey, you guys wanna tell each other's futures now?
"
7,1,Cartman,"Uuugh.
"
3,13,Cartman,"Ey! How come you never pick me?!
"
4,10,Cartman,"What the? 
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well.
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Fuck this!) 
"
17,1,Butters,"Congratulations, Brother! How do you feel?
"
6,1,Cartman,"I think we're looking at a non-exclusive two-year fifty-picture deal here. My calculations put that at about four million dollars.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Should I get it?
"
15,12,Cartman,"Oh my God! Why doesn't everyone just back off?! I know how this works: You're the 99% ganging up on the 1%!
"
2,10,Kyle,"No, it's not cool!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Ice cream. Covered with... chocolate sprinkles...  Double-Stuff Oreos...  He ... He's taking the top of one and...  ...and he puts it together to make Quadruple-Stuffs!  I see...ice cream, and sprinkles, and Quadruple-Stuffs!
"
12,2,Kyle,"Oh, God, what have we done?!
"
17,1,Cartman,"Can't do anything?? You're the NSA!
"
11,1,Cartman,"Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?!  Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?!  I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!
"
4,1,Stan,"That does it! We've got no other choice! We've got to bust Cartman out of jail!
"
6,7,Cartman,"That should be enough water, Kyle. You got the new sea-people packets, Tweek?
"
6,4,Butters,"Dad, uh, why don't you suck my fat one?
"
6,12,Cartman,"Shut up!
"
3,7,Cartman,"We don't have much time!
"
12,11,Kyle,"Yeah. How are we supposed to know that pan flute bands would be outlawed?
"
4,2,Kyle,"That can't be. My parents wouldn't lie to me.
"
16,1,Randy,"Yeah, but... but if you sit on it that way, you have to take your pants all the way off.
"
3,2,Stan,"Wow, that was short. 
"
1,9,Kyle,"Probably just another stupid dreidel anyway.
"
9,12,Randy,"Tom Cruise won't come out of the closet.
"
13,13,Cartman,"I do not directly say she's a slut!
"
16,2,Stan,"Grandpa? 
"
17,6,Kyle,"There are greater things at work than what you understand.
"
16,5,Stan,"Huh? Aw, come on!  Dude, what's going on?
"
18,1,Cartman,"Who the hell would burn Kickstarter to the ground?!  Oh my God! That weird little Jewy guy! Kyle!
"
7,10,Kyle,"Why are they all out driving at the same time?
"
3,12,Kenny,"(What the hell? What the fuck is this?!) 
"
1,13,Cartman,"Well. To think all this time I'm actually a Naive American.
"
2,8,Stan,"Winter's back!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Put on the hat!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Butters, helping people who have AIDS is one of the most important things you can do.
"
1,1,Kyle,"I don't want to ask Mr. Hat, I'm asking you!
"
1,6,Stan,"What do you mean?
"
10,14,Kyle,"You got it, Stan!
"
1,13,Cartman,"Whatooya mean?
"
8,4,Randy,"No, no, no, it's not on.
"
4,1,Cartman,"You know how you told me you always wanted to see Disneyland?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Right.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Well... then maybe I'll just use them a-al-little bit. You know, as a per-formance en... hancer.
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yeah. But there was so much of it. I was up until two in the morning.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Uh wu we weren't sleeping, Mr. Garrison.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Well it's just that... that's what that Casey kid said about your hairpiece?
"
15,11,Randy,"Noh uh.
"
13,5,Butters,"Hey look, there's Kevin Stoley!  Hey Kevin, do you like fishsticks? 
"
14,14,Stan,"Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!
"
18,10,Kyle,"Uh okay! No problem! 
"
3,2,Kyle,"We know how to fart, Mr. Mackey!
"
4,9,Wendy,"What's that? 
"
14,14,Randy,"Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?
"
6,5,Cartman,"Dude, do you wanna the Terranace & Phillip trailer with messed-up colors? I don't. How's that? 
"
13,8,Stan,"Whoa whoa wait, there really are ghosts?
"
15,7,Cartman,"Look like ice cream to me.
"
8,13,Kyle,"He can't do crap!
"
9,5,Randy,"Good call, ref! Good call!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Butters, do you know how many times Jewpacabra has been shot on video? Zee-ro!  I can't do this alone, please. Help me prove to the rest of the world Jewpacabra is real.
"
4,3,Kyle,"Alright!
"
6,11,Randy,"Wait wait. I learned some Mongolian in college.  Ah, let's see. Uh. K-kids, uh, Bi kute. Bi salnek kute. Uh-d tah tasobarro.
"
6,7,Kyle,"I told you, Cartman.
"
8,11,Kyle,"Yeah, Jimmy's right. I know we can come up with way better ideas than Craig.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Yyeah well, I-I'm sorry I didn't trust you either.
"
12,11,Stan,"Jesus Christ!
"
1,6,Randy,"Did you turn the heat down?
"
11,6,Cartman,"Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass.
"
11,9,Randy,"It wasn't bigger than mine was.
"
6,12,Stan,"We're not building a clubhouse, we're building a ladder to heaven.
"
6,17,Stan,"Well good going, asshole! Thanks to you, there's not gonna be any Christmas, and there's no one left to help us!
"
8,9,Kyle,"See?! That sucks, dude!
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah, screw them!
"
5,7,Stan,"What things??
"
8,14,Stan,"No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist!  I came here to put a stop to all this!
"
16,10,Cartman,"Yeah, no, false alarm again. I'm in the store and some fat bitch asked me if my dad likes cologne.
"
1,8,Cartman,"No, Starvin' Marvin, that's Kenny's creamed corn.  No Starvin' Marvin, that's a bad Starvin' Marvin!
"
8,5,Kyle,"Oh wait. Hey AWESOM-O,  I'd also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long, with peanut butter and raisins on top.
"
2,14,Kyle,"But what are we gonna do?
"
1,1,Cartman,"Oh, man, this sucks.
"
7,13,Kyle,"No, we really want nothing more to do with these people.
"
3,5,Stan,"Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends?
"
16,13,Cartman,"Dude, what's this about orange bracelets? Where do you get them?
"
4,1,Mr. Mackey,"Yes?
"
13,12,Stan,"Yeah, a lot of fags aren't gay.
"
13,6,Randy,"No, Japan! Will you listen to me for five seconds?! If you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions!
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!  Oh my God, what have I said?
"
3,2,Stan,"This spot looks good. 
"
5,14,Butters,"I can't wait till Sunday. I'm eating with my family at Bennigan's tomorrow.
"
13,13,Butters,"We need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school! We will forever remember this day, the day we finally stood up to Wendy Testaburger!
"
2,15,Cartman,"No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?You guys are my best friendsThrough thick and thin, we've always been togetherWe're four of a kind, havin' fun all dayPallin' around and laughin' awayJust best friends, best friends are we.I love you guys. 
"
8,10,Cartman,"A lot of stupid things that we regret.
"
10,8,Kyle,"We're over here, by the cart. 
"
16,11,Butters,"Yeah, ogh, I like that Ben Affleck guy. He's a good filmmaker. Come on, Kenny, I guess I owe the kids at school an apology.  Did you see Argo, Kenny? It's a pretty good movie. Ben Affleck has a lot goin' for him. Not everything, but a lot. Whoopie!
"
4,7,Stan,"We're gon' tuh take Cartman's kidney. 
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat.
"
9,9,Kyle,"What are all you guys doing here?
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Well ih it's good to be a little defensive around you, Miles, m'kay. Let's, let's not forget that your wife died of an ""accident"" while you were ""drinking"" on a ""hike,"" ""N'kay!""
"
10,13,Cartman,"Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side.  Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call. 
"
6,7,Cartman,"That is bullcrap! You'd better stop worshiping him, sea people! 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Butters!
"
2,12,Kenny,"(You suck ass and you suck dick!) 
"
4,12,Stan,"...More like, Ms. Makesmesick. 
"
4,17,Stan,"""Hey, you guys! Seriouslih! I'm so fat! Help me out over hmyah!""
"
4,9,Cartman,"Where the hell is Stan?!
"
11,1,Randy,"You want me to kiss your-
"
7,10,Randy,"Yes Dad.
"
12,13,Kenny,"(No way in hell I'm doing it.)
"
13,14,Kyle,"Are you fucking kidding me?! 
"
12,3,Stan,"Kenny, you home? 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America.
"
3,2,Stan,"That's the fifth store we've been kicked out of. Why is it so hard to get a nurection?
"
6,16,Cartman,"And while they're gone, we're gonna smear all their walls with poop. 
"
5,12,Kenny,"(Ow!)
"
1,1,Stan,"What's a dildo?
"
2,7,Cartman,"Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Boy band.
"
2,13,Stan,"Yeah, let's not ride that ride again.
"
1,1,Stan,"Dude!
"
10,1,Cartman,"No, Chef has always been super-cool.
"
16,4,Butters,"Jesus is a lie?
"
3,11,Mr. Garrison,"...And so, children, that's why Hare Krishnas are totally gay.  Uh, can I help you?
"
16,4,Cartman,"NO! COME BACK! Come back please, this isn't right!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Excuse me, but Ike has homework he's supposed to be doing.
"
17,9,Kenny,"Ha? Ueddingu? 
"
16,5,Butters,"Nnothin' Dad. Jjust a little gassy. 
"
17,6,Kyle,"I happen to be the one person who's putting everyone else's needs before their own!
"
6,14,Kyle,"Oh.
"
2,13,Stan,"We did it, dude, we did it! 
"
7,9,Kyle,"All right, cool.  Let's download some Metallica, and some Stevie Wonder. 
"
7,8,Randy,"It's super-fabulous. Would you like some shirazz?
"
12,11,Randy,"Here here, look, look!  What the?  Oh- ohhh I didn't have a tape in it. 
"
10,4,Cartman,"Okay, I'll make it easy for you.  Pull the Mohammad episode, now!
"
1,12,Cartman,"Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with my triangle, now that it is mmyy triangle.
"
2,9,Kyle,"I have to show you something.  I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Kenny, you got the f-a-g on that perp in Washington
"
8,1,Stan,"Guys, we're we're really not playing, okay? 
"
12,14,Butters,"Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. 
"
6,1,Kyle,"Wait!  You're all making a mistake!
"
8,13,Stan,"He's not gonna do it.
"
7,9,Kyle,"It didn't work! My stupid Jew dad won't lend me money for CDs!
"
9,4,Cartman,"That's not Kenny. Kenny sniffs paint and sets things on fire! Here, look.  Kenny, Kenny look. Want a dollar?
"
6,4,Stan,"Wait a minute. Veal is... little baby cows??
"
7,9,Stan,"We're sorry! We'll, we'll never download music for free again!
"
7,11,Butters,"Ooohhhh!
"
12,8,Kyle,"Somebody do something!
"
14,2,Cartman,"Oh come on!
"
7,2,Timmy,"Rrruh Timmeh!
"
16,4,Cartman,"It was no dog. I was there, I'm telling you this thing had no idea that Jesus Christ had died for our sins.
"
6,16,Stan,"You must know what I'm talking about.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Eh- ...what?
"
5,10,Kyle,"Dude, that poor kid. 
"
6,16,Cartman,"Then how does he know our names?
"
3,17,Kyle,"I don't believe it!
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Alright, upgrade me to the Centurion package.
"
7,13,Kyle,"Aw dude, this is really hard.
"
13,8,Cartman,"So maybe she doesn't know.  Maybe she doesn't know, Kyle! Excuse me, Ma'am, I see you're eating Chipotle.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we'll be fine.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Bull's eye!
"
1,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey.  He comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet.
"
15,10,Stan,"Craig, are we still clear?
"
3,2,Cartman,"Yes it is, you guys. I'm serious now. This is Eric's mom and I want him home right now.
"
2,6,Stan,"How?
"
15,14,Cartman,"This is awesome, Butters! You really think you got something?!
"
6,16,Butters,"Well they both got the same teacher for homeroom, too, but you didn't say anything then.
"
1,7,Kyle,"Ha ha, you look like a pansy.
"
8,14,Stan,"Ugh.
"
16,11,Butters,"No! This is our home! And I'm sick of everyone who thinks they're better than me just 'cause they've got good looks, and just 'cause, even after massacring Daredevil, they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes! You shouldn't be able to be good-looking and be with Jennifer Lopez and be a good director!  All right all right fine! Argo is a good movie! There, I admitted it! I told people that it didn't hold up, but it holds up god darn it! Ben Affleck has everything, GRAGH!
"
15,7,Cartman,"Ohooh dude, sweet! Tackle him!
"
1,8,Stan,"Doesn't look like she's having any trouble finding food.
"
8,11,Stan,"Eric, the outfits are even skimpier than before, leaving very little to the imagination. No doubt that if I were a little older, I would be aroused.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Higher, you guys.
"
4,17,Kyle,"That's one twenty-fourth of a second of our movie already shot! 
"
12,8,Cartman,"So nice to see othaa Chinese peopull heeh. As you can see, we are Chinese peopull ourselves.
"
4,9,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, Mrs. Cartman, I've been uh very bad. M'kay? 
"
3,2,Stan,"He's been up there for like, three weeks.
"
5,14,Butters,"I really wish I didn't know that stuff. I guess I learned that sometimes, lying can be for the best. Yup. Oh well, when I want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at Bennigan's, I forget all about my dad... bein' queer and my mom tryin' to kill me. I'm gonna be okay.
"
11,11,Cartman,"I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
"
1,6,Stan,"Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late.
"
1,5,Kyle,"Which song is that?
"
6,7,Kyle,"Wow. That's a lot of sea men you've got there, Cartman.
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle! Kyle!
"
3,6,Stan,"Well, where is he?!
"
3,16,Kyle,"Oh. Ah-ah. Ah-uh-m-m.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"We don't have time for all that, Chef! Oh, if only those Queer Eye For the Straight Guy people understood what they were doing.  Wait.  That's it! I know exactly what to do!  Come on, Mr. Slave! Let's get back to our flippity floppity floop. 
"
18,3,Wendy,"Cartman is using our bathroom!
"
2,14,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
3,3,Kyle,"This is not a woman! It is a succubus!
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Well, Kyle, living with a lie is never a good thing. Okay. Could... could you maybe just tell me?
"
5,10,Kyle,"Hello?
"
8,9,Stan,"It's time for what?
"
10,2,Stan,"Well... Maybe they'll change.
"
11,11,Cartman,"Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Stan, don't be such a dumbass. You have to trust people. 
"
2,18,Cartman,"Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here!
"
3,11,Stan,"You dumbass, Cartman!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now.
"
2,14,Stan,"Wow, you remember him?
"
14,2,Kyle,"Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-
"
3,17,Cartman,"We're trying to find the brown noise—it's this one pitch, this certain frequency that makes people lose bowel control.
"
3,7,Cartman,"That does it! I'm calling my mom right now, and bustin' your ass! 
"
11,7,Cartman,"Marina del Rey
They're so nice to the homeless
built them port-a-potties
"
12,10,Randy,"What's going on?
"
16,12,Randy,"Ew!  That's enough, Stanley! Ew, gross!
"
4,13,Stan,"Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
"
7,4,Randy,"And I'm a little for bringin' 'em home.
"
7,12,Stan,"Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?
"
7,13,Cartman,"I'm going to kill myself. 
"
4,12,Kyle,"Ungh, gay, dude.
"
2,12,Stan,"Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.
"
10,9,Mr. Mackey,"You got a whole school here, Clyde! M'kay? You got over three hundred people that need to use the boys' room.  Then you decide you're gonna be a comedian, m'kay, and pinch one off in the urinal, and leave it layin' there for everyone to have to look at!  Okay okay, you think it's funny, but nobody else does! They gotta walk in that bathroom and see your rancid dook propped up against the back of the urinal like a brown rag doll! 
"
9,8,Randy,"Don't be a fag!  Come on! We can make it!  We have to try!
"
8,9,Randy,"I'll make less money, sure, but... as long as I buy everything at Wall-Mart, it'll all even out. Don't you see? Wall-Mart isn't our enemy, it's our neighborhood friend.
"
15,7,Stan,"Hang on guys!
"
2,10,Kyle,"What?
"
8,14,Stan,"I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?
"
6,4,Butters,"Eh yeah I do too!
"
3,2,Kyle,"Where's your dad?
"
16,5,Stan,"But I worked hard on that! It's, it's been really stressful and I-
"
2,15,Kyle,"Like what?
"
16,9,Kyle,"Yeah! g'uh... A, a documentary?
"
18,3,Stan,"Uh hey Dad. I need to talk to you.
"
1,10,Cartman,"Now, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Choopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money... 
"
12,13,Cartman,"""Don't make fun of my diabetes, I'm Scott Malkinson."" 
"
2,17,Cartman,"Oh, I get it.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"More snow for South P... P-P-Park. Here's Token Black with the weather.
"
2,6,Stan,"Good. A-and action! 
"
9,4,Stan,"Oh wow...
"
12,7,Butters,"Our teacher said we have to hold hands the whole time we're here!
"
9,3,Stan,"Yeah!
"
2,12,Stan,"No.
"
4,12,Kyle,"And did you see her lazy eye? You can't even tell what she's looking at.
"
1,2,Cartman,"There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Hold it.
"
12,12,Stan,"Dad, what are you doing?!
"
6,1,Stan,"What?
"
6,2,Butters,"Uh you're not really gonna go down that K-13 run, are ya, Stan?
"
4,2,Kenny,"(No I don't! Thank you.)
"
9,9,Butters,"Hey Mom and Dad, I'm not- 
"
12,7,Kyle,"That guy is wearing a digital watch.
"
13,3,Kyle,"What's that? 
"
12,12,Randy,"Yes I can! Yes I can! 
"
15,8,Kyle,"About three minutes, fatass!
"
5,4,Kyle,"Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya.
"
8,9,Kyle,"Dude, I can't deal with Wall-Mart right now. My parents had me there for three hours last night. 
"
12,9,Cartman,"All right, fine Wendy!  I'll fight ya you big bully!
"
3,14,Kenny,"(Oh. Flutes are gay?)
"
10,13,Butters,"Oh, all right then.
"
5,6,Cartman,"HA! If you need money, you can get a JOB, Stan! No freeloaders are gonna take my hard-earned cash!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Okay.  Here we go, pack of chewing gum. 
"
14,6,Kenny,"(What?)
"
9,9,Butters,"Well, I'm workin' on it.
"
2,18,Kyle,"HELP! 
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"Yes.  Where the fuck did you hear this ridiculous load of bullshit? 
"
8,11,Cartman,"Parent-teacher conferences will be held this Wednesday night, from seven to nine. So kids, get a lot of playing in before you get grounded. And now, for a look at what's on the menu for school lunch today, here's Stan Marsh.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs.
"
4,7,Stan,"If she hears him screaming, or comes out or anything, just... stall her. Alright?
"
7,3,Butters,"Hey fellas!
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle, you have to hold your breath!  Oh, very funny! 
"
6,9,Cartman,"Oh, do we wanna do that?
"
15,8,Stan,"God, shut up! Everyone just shut the fuck up! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Wuh ih uh... Weh come on, Kyle, who the hell else are you gonna take besides Stan and Kenny?
"
2,12,Stan,"...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!
"
2,11,Kyle,"You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!
"
4,11,Cartman,"We are saving your daughter from the clutches of hell, suh! 
"
5,12,Cartman,"Shutup, Jew!  Yes, well. For my project, I made a pencil, taped to a pen. In this way we see the duality of writing devices that occur in nature.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Scared of a plastic frog?
"
1,2,Wendy,"You see, I've learned something today. You can't win all the time. And if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose.
"
16,1,Kyle,"Is your mom always like that dude?
"
18,10,Cartman,"Please show your support for CartmanBrah brah right now by uh...
"
11,7,Randy,"Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people.
"
16,13,Cartman,"So weak dude. Dark times, brah, dark times.  Dude, what the hell? You're wearing a ""What Would Jesus Do"" bracelet!
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Sure.
"
13,3,Stan,"So?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE.
"
1,11,Stan,"Wow. I can't believe Ms. Ellen was a criminal Iraqi fugitive.
"
1,1,Kyle,"But I...
"
1,11,Kyle,"How did your date with Ms. Ellen go?
"
2,18,Stan,"You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
"
12,10,Stan,"Oh Jesus, there's another one!  Another pan flute band! Have you guys noticed there's bands like this everywhere you go lately? 
"
7,12,Cartman,"Oh no! You guys broke up?
"
3,8,Stan,"Butters, is there any way out of here?
"
8,8,Randy,"You think the school mascot should be a turd sandwich? Well you're not exactly Einstein!
"
4,9,Cartman,"That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass!  I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!
"
4,14,Cartman,"Leave?? Leave?? But nobody else knows the part of Helen Keller!
"
17,2,Cartman,"And why was that?! Because one kid's dad actually went and killed his mom! For all we know, that kid's parents have been doing drugs and cheating on each other for years! Maybe watching murder porn had nothin' to do with it!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Because, Butters, Kyle was spying on us, okay-  Kyle was spying on us, and he knows that we put the video of Craig's mom on the Internet. He found out everything. That's why I had to make another video.
"
6,12,Stan,"Oh shit. Who had the ticket stub?
"
8,6,Kenny,"Aaaah! Aaaah, stop! A- 
"
15,14,Cartman,"My mom is so poor she waves around a Popsicle and calls it air conditioning. I wish I could be put in a kewl foster home like Kenny's familyyy.
"
14,7,Stan,"Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Uhokay. 
"
13,13,Cartman,"And so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable Smurfberries. Yeah well big deal. At what cost did our school president get it? Every Smurf is dead. Wiped out and we will never see them again! Go on, look outside! You won't see any Smurfs!  Of course, since I'm being silenced, I'm not allowed time to show you the entire movie. And so please buy Dances with Smurfs available now on DVD.  The question now is, What happened to morals? What happened to dignity? What happened to my schooool?
"
2,18,Stan,"What are you doing, Gorak!
"
2,10,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes.
"
3,14,Kyle,"Yeah. Too bad you're such a dumbass in history, or you would have known that!
"
13,3,Kyle,"You want something new every week, fatass.
"
12,10,Stan,"Yeah dude, kids at school totally like us. Craig is just being a dick because we're having a tough time right now.
"
5,5,Cartman,"Oh, Kyle, you just made a huge withdrawal at the First Bank of Lies.
"
12,4,Stan,"Ah, hi. We made a really successful thing on the Internet, and we'd like to collect our money.
"
7,10,Randy,"Oh brother. Well, good job, dad! Look at you now!
"
4,2,Cartman,"I love that song, Mom. Sing it again.
"
16,13,Stan,"Yeah, I've been kind of seein' that.
"
6,13,Stan,"Nothing.  Hey, kid!
"
6,6,Kyle,"Lame
"
14,4,Stan,"Profile? I'm not a profile.
"
6,2,Cartman,"Ugh, no more., 
"
2,6,Cartman,"That's it! Now I'm all pissed off!  Take that, hippie! 
"
1,1,Stan,"Bleech!
"
10,1,Cartman,"Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Come on. Come on.  Come on. Oho, this is so sweet!  You guys, seriously, this is sooo sweet!
"
9,10,Cartman,"...Why are you doing this?
"
6,1,Cartman,"Well, you don't sound like me. My name is Butters and I'm a little pussy who won't help his friends make money.
"
5,6,Stan,"""There you are, Jennifer Lopez!""  ""You've been most uncooperative, Ms. Lopez.""
"
11,5,Randy,"I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore.
"
3,4,Stan,"How come you didn't show up for the fight, Tweek?!
"
5,12,Cartman,"Oh, looks like you landed on Park Avenue, Stan. You own me ten million dollars.
"
14,8,Stan,"Cartman, dude, what's wrong?
"
18,3,Wendy,"That isn't fair!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!
"
8,6,Kyle,"I don't think Mr. Jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice. Come on! 
"
9,1,Kyle,"Yeah. My school teacher wanted to be a woman, and you made him into one.
"
10,8,Butters,"I got World of Warcraft, like you said.
"
4,9,Cartman,"There's nothing faggy about $10 million dollars, asshole! This was a message from God!
"
2,9,Stan,"Why?
"
8,1,Cartman,"Now remember, Butters, when you get to the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and- Butters, listen! At the vet's office, you need to stay down on all fours and bark a lot.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Hey douchebag, are you doing anything kewl?
"
12,10,Mr. Garrison,"They're really furry! 
"
6,15,Kyle,"I have to join Jewleeard and make Grandma proud!  Tell my parents I'll call them. 
"
1,12,Stan,"It's Saturday.
"
6,1,Butters,"Hu-oh! Goody!
"
5,7,Kyle,"""No, no, please! This time I swear I won't make albums or movies.""
"
13,10,Stan,"No, you can't possibly mean that-!
"
11,1,Cartman,"""Rise above it!"" Get it? Like he can rise above anything! 
"
7,10,Stan,"And Grandpa, you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior, but you should also realize that, when you're behind the wheel, you're a killing machine.
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn to hide our emotions with math problems.  M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication tables over here, m'kay. First we'll do uh, four time four, m'kay?
"
5,4,Kyle,"Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish?  Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it's a black widow! 
"
3,15,Cartman,"that's why they're lame.
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Gee, that's a terrible thing, Eric. Um comedy can be the best therapy, very much.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh, Mike, you're breakin' my balls here, Mike.
"
7,14,Stan,"Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. 
"
13,7,Cartman,"Yes! Do you really wanna go back to that?!
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Hi, Mrs. Campbell.
"
9,3,Kyle,"You assholes stole our client! How about some Goddamn business ethics?!
"
1,8,Cartman,"Hey you guys, do you hear something?! Ah- I think I hear the flower children calling!
"
3,17,Kyle,"That's amazing.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
1,11,Cartman,"Oh, weak! Chef's gonna make sweet love to Ms. Ellen!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Mm, 'kay, Mm.  N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... 
"
2,7,Stan,"What?
"
4,12,Kyle,"Wow! I had already forgotten how great third grade was.
"
10,2,Cartman,"We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!
"
1,2,Stan,"Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?
"
3,12,Kyle,"Well, she's not here! That's just great! Thanks a lot, Stan! You're gonna get me busted again!
"
11,8,Butters,"You... you and your cousin touched wieners?
"
1,6,Stan,"I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes.
"
8,3,Kyle,"Dude! I've been freaked out this whole time because of that guy's movie?
"
3,16,Mr. Garrison,"He's coming out!
"
6,9,Cartman,"AY!
"
10,10,Cartman,"I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish?
"
6,13,Cartman,"I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!
"
7,14,Stan,"The pain is everlasting.
I miss you so much, babe.
Want to hold you in my arms again, girl.
Want to-
"
5,12,Stan,"Come on, guys. We'll just have to find other stuff to do. 
"
12,7,Kyle,"Why aren't the cops coming in?
"
7,14,Butters,"Lexus! 
"
6,15,Stan,"What?! 
"
18,8,Randy,"Won't somebody help me out?! Get someone- You, little girl! Can you please just, just check behind your ear?!  Oh, it was behind her ear.  And there we go and we're all better and I am the Amazingly Randi! Thank you! 
"
17,10,Wendy,"Look it up, stupid!  In real life, Kim Kardashian has the body of a hobbit!  You're gonna be in real trouble when the teachers find out what you said to that poor girl! 
"
3,2,Randy,"Uuuh, I- I'll try to find a solution.
"
5,1,Butters,"Uh, Ms. Choksondik, eh, can we say it in the expletive? Like, ""Oh, shit,"" or, ""shit on a shingle""?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Uh you did what? 
"
12,9,Wendy,"Ma'am?
"
6,15,Cartman,"What the hell are you assholes doing here?!
"
12,10,Randy,"There's Shelly. You excited about eating dinner Shelly?
"
6,7,Kyle,"...Yeah. So?
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Alright!) 
"
10,2,Butters,"You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
"
3,12,Stan,"That's just an old legend.
"
9,11,Kyle,"Oh... hey there. 
"
9,6,Butters,"Boy oh boy, Eric, you've got a lot to atone for.
"
10,10,Kyle,"It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Really? Awesome!
"
12,2,Stan,"Yeah, we'll just get a picture of her doing something else.
"
17,10,Kyle,"Yeah. Clearly Annie Nelson is the hottest girl at our school. Look at those eyes!
"
4,3,Stan,"Mom, Dad, you're not gonna send them back, are you??
"
13,6,Stan,"It's uh, Marsh. 
"
18,2,Kyle,"That's right, we've still got Lorde. You talked to your dad, right Stan?
"
13,1,Cartman,"The Jonas Brothers? Dude, Kenny, what the hell is wrong with you? 
"
2,9,Wendy,"Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them.
"
5,1,Randy,"That makes sense.
"
6,7,Butters,"No! No! 
"
4,2,Cartman,"I'll tell you why it has to be you, Kenny: because your family is poor, and therefore has bad oral hygiene, so your teeth are gonna fall out someday, anyway. If you think about it, you should actually be thanking us.  ""Oh, thank you, guys."" You're welcome, Kenny.
"
9,13,Kyle,"What do you wanna talk about?
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Hey!)
"
15,2,Kyle,"Yeah, sorry dude uh, I can't make it either.
"
17,7,Butters,"I'm obsessed with wieners? Well what about HBO?
"
4,8,Wendy,"That's because you're stupid, and you're a racist!
"
15,12,Stan,"That's what we mean by ""grow up"" dude! Stop being a baby!
"
16,8,Stan,"Yeah Dad. You need some of this. 
"
6,13,Butters,"The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Very good, Kyle.
"
8,4,Cartman,"All right, Butters! 
"
6,11,Mr. Mackey,"No helping!  M'kay, I'm not really sure havin' all the parents here is a good idea, m'kay?
"
18,4,Timmy,"Tutih Tuh-Timmih?
"
11,2,Butters,"Well yeah, sure.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.
"
9,12,Stan,"I can't. I'm writing a new sacred doctrine for my church.
"
16,14,Kyle,"We need everyone's help here. What you're looking for are big boxes of ballots. Hundreds of them. Please check your basement, your attic, and-
"
8,4,Stan,"Cool, because, there's this competition on Saturday, and I have to find the very best dancers in South Park to be on my crew. My friends can't do it because they suck ass, so, will you be in my dance troupe?
"
1,9,Kyle,"Hey!  How about Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo?
"
12,7,Butters,"I'm not lettin' go!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Go. 
"
1,6,Stan,"Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!
"
2,11,Stan,"What other crime in South Park?
"
4,8,Wendy,"There. Now, the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history. As times change we hope to grow, and as we grow our rules must change. It is a natural part of evolution. Thank you. 
"
2,12,Stan,"What?!
"
5,8,Kyle,"Okay.
"
1,5,Kyle,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastards!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Oh nonono, now you're gonna have to get us something else! 
"
10,10,Butters,"Haaaah!
"
4,15,Cartman,"You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!
"
11,7,Kyle,"You're welcome. 
"
15,4,Kyle,"You get in trouble again, Cartman?
"
7,11,Kyle,"You've always been a dick to me, Cartman, and I'm not inviting you. 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Well, check everywhere! I'm not paying you guys each twenty bucks to scratch your buttholes!
"
2,11,Cartman,"Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!
"
14,6,Kyle,"We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
"
17,2,Cartman,"Boooo, Wendy Testaburger, Boooooo!  Boo Wendy! Liar!
"
11,7,Kyle,"I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
"
3,15,Cartman,"Yes, we know, Ms. Broflovski. It's so very interesting.
"
12,12,Randy,"Who let the Obama out?  Ohoh, police are here. OooooOOOOooo!
"
11,9,Stan,"That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?
"
10,10,Cartman,"I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!
"
6,6,Butters,"Wull what is it?
"
5,8,Stan,"Oh, yeah, we got baseball practice today. God damnit!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Oh, God, when is this gonna end?
"
7,9,Kyle,"You're on, fat boy!
"
16,6,Stan,"Hey ah, I'm so sorry, but we have an emergency. Our friend is really really sick.
"
8,1,Butters,"bu- but fellas, I gotta- 
"
7,3,Cartman,"And you feel like you have to confess.
"
8,10,Cartman,"You guys, we're free! We haven't a care in the world!
"
9,4,Stan,"Yeah, Kenny finally found something he's really good at.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too.
"
6,6,Butters,"Hehey, fellas. I'm glad you called me. There was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse, and I thought we should all go.
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Uuuhh. Mmm mkay.
"
12,9,Wendy,"I can't!  God damn it!
"
4,11,Timmy,"Timmiiiy!
"
1,10,Mr. Garrison,"Wow, we have royalty in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era.  Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass...
"
1,1,Cartman,"You are making it up. 
"
5,8,Cartman,"Alright, I think we go over there. 
"
6,8,Stan,"What? He did.
"
10,3,Cartman,"Suck mah balls, Kyle! 
"
1,10,Cartman,"Right. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.
"
8,4,Stan,"Great! 
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, I hope you all did your homework last night, because we're goin' to talk about pages 42 through 612. First of all, who can tell me what year the Founding Fathers got together?  Let's see, how about...
"
17,2,Kyle,"You mean that we're forced to pay for the Oprah channel?
"
5,12,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
2,14,Cartman,"Stinky britches, you got stinky--
"
6,1,Stan,"We're gonna take before and after photos, and then, when he gets skinny from eating your food, we'll show the world.
"
7,14,Stan,"So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don't think so.
"
2,9,Kyle,"What is it, Mr. Hankey?
"
6,1,Stan,"Okay, so now, do you wanna use our friend in your commercials?
"
4,1,Cartman,"Huh-who's Romper Stomper?
"
8,9,Stan,"Stan Marsh. Now, where's the heart?
"
12,14,Butters,"Goth kids burned down the Hot Topic, and sure enough, soon as they did I tried eatin' a hot dog and it tasted good. My vampire teeth even fell out when I bit into it. I'm human again!
"
11,12,Kyle,"Hi Superman.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Pfffft. Aw, that's a doozie, Wendy! You come up with that one on your own?!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Aaand cut!  Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!
"
6,5,Kyle,"Look! Crack addicts with a television! 
"
4,10,Stan,"Okay, come on. 
"
2,16,Kyle,"It was a fake!
"
11,14,Wendy,"Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks?
"
10,7,Cartman,"Quit it, mom!
"
6,4,Butters,"Oh I don't know about this, fellas. It says right here on the Mission Impossible Breaking and Entering playset: ""Not for actual breaking and entereing. B-breaking and entering is a cr-riime.""
"
1,11,Kyle,"Hey! We should buy Ms. Ellen Valentine's Day presents. 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Say Timmy, did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros?
"
4,10,Stan,"Oh no! It's locked!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Are you okay?
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Come, on, just try it out. You can be Terrance or Phillip or both. You can walk around and collect Canada cash to build new stuff.  It's the perfect thing if you're bored. And honestly, the best part about it, is it's free. I mean, come. On. Why wouldn't you download it, and just try it out? 
"
9,3,Cartman,"Come on, Wing!
"
15,5,Cartman,"You've got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up, Kyle. And best of all, it's all charity, so it's tax free. 
"
12,7,Butters,"Do you see any Indians?
"
10,13,Cartman,"I want one of those time-phone things.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Mkay. Drive carefully, mkay? 
"
14,6,Cartman,"Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
"
9,6,Butters,"Please leave me alone, Eric. My bottom is really sore.
"
16,1,Kyle,"Don't you just feel a little bad for Clyde?
"
7,4,Randy,"Why are we fightin' this war?'There's a man in the office we didn't vote for.'They didn't give me a choice.'War is not my voice! Yeaaaaahhhh!
"
7,13,Kenny,"(Uh huh.)
"
8,1,Kyle,"Wow, cool.
"
9,8,Cartman,"You know how?
"
2,11,Cartman,"Thaat's right, suck on that. 
"
3,4,Kyle,"How??
"
18,1,Kyle,"When was that?
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"It is, too late for me, young Wendy.
"
2,10,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?
"
9,9,Cartman,"Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don't have a lot of time, so I'll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Go ahead, that's more for us.  You want some beef jerky, buddy? Yes, who's the buddy? Who's hungry?  Who's the hungry man?
"
9,5,Cartman,"How the hell was that a strike?!  Goddamnit, he's going to first!
"
4,7,Kyle,"Better, thanks.
"
5,7,Cartman,"Here, talk to them, Butters.
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"I can't take it, Mayor. You have to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Uhh trust me, he's not fat and unimportant. I think we need to change his status to ""ripped and sweet.""  'Scuse me. Excuse me! There's a very important threat to national security! We need to change Eric Cartman's status!
"
7,6,Stan,"Okay, okay. Ready? Break the door down! 
"
8,2,Jimmy,"S-s-six!
"
6,2,Butters,"Hey, do you guys smell that?
"
5,6,Cartman,"No! But I don't... ah... ah...  Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.
"
3,15,Kyle,"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
"
4,6,Stan,"Yeah. You know, we believe in equality for everybody, and tolerance, and all that gay stuff, but dude, fuck you.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Thank you so much. Christ has really blessed us with talent.
"
11,11,Cartman,"Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you.
"
4,6,Kyle,"Yeah. I guess we gotta try to get into that club, too.
"
15,12,Jimmy,"...Excuse me, can you use a different terminology please?
"
7,8,Kyle,"God-damnit!
"
4,8,Wendy,"Stan?! How could you be so insensitive?!
"
5,6,Kyle,"No... No, this isn't possible.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Here. We got you some sticky cinnamon buns. 
"
6,5,Kyle,"We're not kids. We're full-grown men with dwarfism! How dare you assume that all midgets are children! We demand an apology!
"
11,10,Kyle,"That if he could prove leprechauns exist, I would suck his balls.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oh my... God. 
"
8,9,Cartman,"Ha! You owe me five bucks, Kyle!
"
2,6,Kyle,"Well, he screwed us by makin' something up; I say we do the same thing.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
"
10,3,Kyle,"Ike? Iiike!  Ike! 
"
8,8,Kyle,"You misled him, fatass!
"
15,5,Butters,"Every single night.
"
8,11,Kyle,"Wait! You know what we should do? We should all take a bunch of cough medicine!
"
10,10,Cartman,"Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway! 
"
2,6,Kyle,"Who are you?
"
8,9,Stan,"...What?
"
11,1,Randy,"Please I, I don't want any trouble.
"
4,9,Cartman,"But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do,  so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the--   Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-damnit..! 
"
13,7,Butters,"Eric! Hey Eric. Listen, we wanna go home.
"
16,12,Randy,"I'll take a DVD of Robocop 2 and the director's cut of Blade Runner.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Here, Kyle. 
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, uhuh, Stanley, can I talk to you for a minute?
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Well why the hell didn't you say so! Come on, let's go!
"
12,8,Butters,"What? Uh where are you going, Eric?
"
11,3,Kyle,"No way.
"
2,13,Stan,"Dude, that bull's gonna kill him.
"
15,10,Cartman,"Yeah, I think they're all ready.
"
17,5,Kyle,"I couldn't get in to see the principal, Ike.
"
16,12,Stan,"Oh, let's go to the Petersons' house.
"
16,2,Stan,"You're not?
"
9,6,Butters,"Hey, I think she could see you too. You really are a ghost.
"
18,7,Butters,"Okay, I'm back in your room!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Alright, so apparently what we're gonna do now is hand-count each person's ballot--
"
16,12,Randy,"Hello, welcome to Blockbuster!  Can I help you find something?
"
1,11,Kyle,"Really?
"
5,14,Butters,"...Well ah, I'm happy you're alive too, Mom. So now can we go to Bennigan's?
"
8,1,Kyle,"But don't tell anybody we have them.
"
7,11,Kyle,"What?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Uh oo what?
"
5,13,Stan,"I- 
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, it's the middle of the day! I thought you weren't going to drink as much anymore!
"
6,17,Cartman,"This is such a magical Christmas adventure, you guys.
"
10,10,Kyle,"What?
"
16,9,Stan,"Haven't you heard what happened? Honey Boo Boo's heart gave out.
"
15,10,Timmy,"Run. 
"
4,14,Wendy,"Doctor, doctor! Will our daughter be okay?
"
5,6,Kyle,"""No, please! I promise I'll never make another album or movie!""
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Come on, push it! Push it!  Yeah. Nice p-pecs. Sweet b-biceps. 
"
11,7,Cartman,"Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?
"
5,2,Stan,"What do we want?
"
4,3,Stan,"We've just gotta get that angry mob back on our side!  Alright, everybody, listen up! Those bastards broke in here and took those poor quintuplets to the mayor's office downtown! But they haven't won yet! I say we all go over to the mayor's office, and demand to see the quintuplets right now!
"
5,4,Butters,"Wuh what are you gonna do?
"
6,10,Randy,"But Stanley, you can't let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they're just boobs; your friends... are forever.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles! Gobbles!
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"Can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here, please?
"
2,4,Kyle,"I need one ticket for my little brother.
"
6,4,Cartman,"They look so delicious. 
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Those richers are getting snooty. We've got to show those richers they're not welcome here!
"
6,8,Randy,"Oh boy, now that we're atheists we don't have to pray for our food.
"
5,5,Stan,"Guys, we have no choice. We're gonna have to move away. Environmental activists don't use logic or reason.
"
11,1,Randy,"I just... need some aspirin.
"
1,2,Stan,"Tell me what you wrote about!
"
3,12,Stan,"Where's Kenny? He said he had the best Halloween costume ever. 
"
4,2,Stan,"Dude, every time I lost a tooth I only got a quarter.
"
9,8,Kyle,"No, Cartman, I have no idea what you're talking about!
"
3,13,Stan,"We've never seen you before. Do you live in the woods or something?
"
18,7,Cartman,"All right, Butters. Behind you you should see the door. Go through it and head outside.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Whoa.
"
11,1,Randy,"Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G.
"
18,10,Kyle,"Uh thanks, Mr. Cosby!
"
17,5,Kyle,"I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.
"
18,8,Stan,"A way to finally do something good for other people.
"
1,7,Stan,"We gotta call that Worcecestershire sauce hotline.
"
6,5,Kyle,"What if they don't show the Terrance & Phillip trailer at all? What if we went through all of this for nothing?
"
15,1,Stan,"Let me see your iPad, Cartman.
"
7,15,Cartman,"Dude, look at that. Sprinkle Time Make Your Own Marshmallow Factory. I'm definitely asking for that for Christmas.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Sorry, Marvin. We tried.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Woo-hoo!!) 
"
15,7,Kyle,"Dude, you've... you've changed.
"
3,14,Kyle,"Yeah. He doesn't even know that the South loses the Civil War.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Ke...c-come again?
"
2,3,Stan,"Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
"
2,14,Cartman,"Yeah, and he’s Jewish.
"
15,1,Kyle,"What are you talking about?!
"
5,9,Stan,"Oh, it's just a goat. 
"
16,1,Cartman,"Of course, man. It's cool.
"
18,7,Butters,"Who's the man now?! I'm gonna take his car! This is like Grand Theft Auto!
"
14,7,Cartman,"I'm supposed to be allowed to finish, right? Is that right?  The Jews have been persecuted across the earth for good reason, Kyle. You are a race of beady-eyed thieves who are always wan- 
"
14,2,Butters,"Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
"
5,7,Cartman,"Yeah, you want us unprotected, asshole?!
"
7,15,Stan,"Oh all right, but we'd better not miss out on great Christmas adventures.
"
13,14,Stan,"Come on, show us how long you can hold your breath.
"
4,12,Cartman,"There, that's better.
"
1,4,Cartman,"Oh, Marty's Movie Reviews are on, kick ass!
"
7,7,Mr. Garrison,"Sorry, Charlies! You can just keep your filthy bastard Indian money!
"
2,18,Stan,"No, I'll go! I found him!
"
7,12,Stan,"Hey Gary.
"
11,11,Cartman,"No! Goddammit no!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Steve, wait!
"
16,12,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
11,3,Butters,"Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice.
"
4,1,Cartman,"You... well... I know you don't think you've... ever been anybody's friend, but, well, you're a friend to me.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Oh, God damnit!
"
1,1,Cartman,"No, Mom, leave me alone! 
"
4,9,Randy,"Because I said so!
"
12,11,Stan,"Wow. 
"
8,1,Stan,"It's all right, Kyle. We'll go back to the fair and return them.
"
16,7,Cartman,"What?! Fuck you, Cupid Me!
"
7,2,Cartman,"Can too!
"
18,1,Stan,"...Nnnno, there isn't. 
"
16,14,Cartman,"I know my rights! Stop right now! 
"
13,3,Kyle,"What's going on?
"
1,4,Cartman,"Stan, you need to lay off the cough syrup, alright, seriously. I'm worried about you man. 
"
2,13,Kyle,"Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
"
13,3,Stan,"No, you just lost it all!
"
5,11,Cartman,"Uh, it's nice to meet you, Kyle. I can certainly tell you're a relative of my good friend Kyle here. 
"
13,13,Butters,"I don't know about all of you, but I have had enough! We've been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet! But today, we do something about it!  So let's march right over there to Wendy's house and do what we know needs to be done! 
"
5,13,Cartman,"Aah! Kyle!  Kyle! 
"
2,13,Stan,"Yeah, and then those Terrance and Phillip dolls will be ours!
"
9,14,Randy,"No, Stan, you don't understand. There's a church in Bailey. The statue of the Virgin Mary is bleeding out her ass.
"
11,13,Kyle,"Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. 
"
1,3,Randy,"Uhh...
"
4,1,Kenny,"(Yes)
"
6,4,Stan,"Kiss my ass!
"
5,12,Kyle,"And Cartman for being stupid.
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"Who should we call on next Mr. Hat?
"
13,14,Randy,"Sir, please, my son is in there! What's happened?
"
5,9,Cartman,"Mehah...  What's up, bin Laden?
"
3,11,Cartman,"Wait. I remember. It was the red button! 
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey! Hey, open the door!
"
16,10,Kyle,"Take a look. 
"
10,2,Cartman,"Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
"
9,10,Cartman,"Damnit! I knew you'd say that! You always have it out for me!
"
3,8,Stan,"Shut up, Pip.
"
3,14,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"That's good. 
"
3,1,Kyle,"They're... they're bastards.
"
4,13,Kyle,"No!
"
6,17,Stan,"Why would Iraqis do that? Why?
"
1,1,Stan,"Go on, Kyle, ask 'em for your little brother back.
"
11,5,Stan,"Okay, fine. 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Mmm. And why do you know that, Kyle?
"
10,8,Cartman,"What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
"
2,10,Stan,"Wow, coo-hul!
"
8,1,Stan,"Sh shhhh. It's okay, Butters. Calm down. It's not that bad, really.
"
7,2,Cartman,"But they say I can't be in their club!!
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh, hello, folks. Uh what's the problem?
"
3,2,Cartman,"Hey, there you guys are!
"
13,8,Cartman,"Including the late and very talented Billy Mays!
"
2,8,Cartman,"Where is Chef?
"
3,1,Cartman,"I'm asserting myself. It's tough love. Just like my Mr. Kitty. When he's bad I say, ""Uh that a bad Mr. Kitty!"" and I smack him on the head!
"
13,4,Stan,"On television us children are starting to see and hear more and more graphic queefing.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me!  Now hand it over!
"
18,3,Butters,"Just hold it. That's what I do now. 
"
13,6,Randy,"What?  Hey, hey Sharon.
"
16,9,Cartman,"That's not the way this country works, Kyle.  Your bathroom has to be to code for my mobility scooter.  It's the law.
"
13,9,Butters,"I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch , and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school!  Do you know what I am saying?
"
3,8,Stan,"Sh!
"
18,1,Stan,"You alright dude?
"
18,7,Cartman,"I'm gonna get you back to reality, Butters. But you have to give me time! I've gotta go. The Orion parameters are embellishing. Just stay quiet! 
"
7,3,Stan,"Yes, dude!
"
1,7,Stan,"Yeah, me too.
"
6,17,Cartman,"That's what I thought.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball.
"
9,9,Butters,"No! That darn device is nothin' but trouble! Ah I'm done, and I'm goin' home to tell my Mom and Dad I'm not dead! 
"
4,2,Stan,"Kyle?
"
2,15,Stan,"No, mom!
"
5,2,Butters,"Oh, no. No. Oh, no. No! Oh no no! 
"
12,8,Butters,"But Eric, wu-why would the, Chinese tell us their invasion plans?
"
7,9,Cartman,"The Body of Christ! Sleek swimmer's body, all muscled up and toned!
The Body of Christ! O, Lord Almighty, I wish I could call it my own!
You're one time, two times, three times my Savior...
Whenever I see Jesus up on that Cross I can't help but think that he looks kinda hot...
"
1,12,Kyle,"If it'll make you leave me alone, then just take the damned thing! Here!  There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel really, really good about yourself!
"
6,7,Cartman,"Frances, let's talk. I don't want a bunch of bullcrap from you and you don't a bunch of bullcrap from me, right? Where does that get us? Nowhere. The truth is, I'm completely certified to handle sea men, and though I may appear young, I'm one of the leading sea men authorities of the Midwest. Up and comer, you know what I'm saying? I'll have my own business soon and I'll need people to run it. I'm talkin' about you, Frances. And I'm talkin' about a six-figure income. How does that sound? 
"
14,5,Stan,"We made a promise... to Jesus! 
"
8,4,Stan,"Over at the True Value parking lot. There were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like, really good dancers and, we don't really understand what it means, but I guess-
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh wait wait wait. Was it the pagan remark?
"
4,13,Cartman,"Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--
"
18,8,Kenny,"(Yeah, I guess. I just wonder about McNuggets.)
"
8,10,Butters,"Ohhh hamburgers! 
"
13,3,Randy,"Wow, the new Margaritaville!  With salsa dispenser! ""Just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom."" Oh, we need this! 
"
9,14,Stan,"That's not disciprine.
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Hat!
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, we all need to start studying more and fighting less, m'kay? 
"
15,11,Randy,"Nuh uh.
"
1,12,Kyle,"What would we use a marble sack for?
"
5,8,Cartman,"That's... so... cool!
"
6,1,Kyle,"But you're lying to people. If they knew that you didn't eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Uh... 'Cause I'm just like you guys. Uh-I'm one of you.
"
2,16,Stan,"This is Nebraska?
"
4,9,Stan,"Yeah.
"
13,3,Stan,"What?!
"
2,3,Kyle,"Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!
"
1,12,Cartman,"Come on, Stan, it's mine! I'll roshambo you for it! 
"
13,14,Stan,"Come on Kyle, let's go check out the fireboat.
"
13,7,Butters,"No, I'm sick of it!
"
9,13,Stan,"Let's go see the stingrays, and then we can go to the sea lion show.
"
9,1,Mr. Garrison,"Do I look like a woman?
"
1,4,Cartman,"Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan's little homo dog.
"
15,12,Jimmy,"Hello sir, we are here on behalf of all fourth graders at South Park Elementary.
"
1,13,Cartman,"Huho. So you're not my dad?
"
3,3,Kyle,"Mr. Derp?
"
3,13,Cartman,"That sounds cool. Maybe I'll go to that.
"
8,9,Kyle,"What the hell? 
"
1,5,Stan,"It wasn't me Uncle Jimbo, it was my evil genetic clone.
"
8,10,Stan,"Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall. 
"
4,15,Cartman,"Two donuts and a pack of licorice.  Well, Tony, the usual?  Why are you crying, Chad?
"
4,10,Butters,"No! I mean, poor Timmy's gonna go to hell! He can't confess his sins, 'cause all he can say is his name!
"
1,11,Stan,"What happened? Didn't you make sweet love to her?
"
3,9,Kyle,"That's Moses, stupid! 
"
5,1,Cartman,"You know, that stuff you get as an appetizer at Thai food restaurants. Meecrob, dude, is way grosser than ""shit"", dude. I'd scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before I ate another plate of meecrob. 
"
1,12,Kyle,"AAAAAA!
"
14,9,Mr. Garrison,"He's still questioning that new prisoner.
"
7,4,Kyle,"We didn't do our homework.
"
14,4,Stan,"Where?
"
18,3,Randy,"Shelly, that's enough time on your phone.
"
10,4,Cartman,"Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Yeah yeah, let's do it to Clyde.
"
18,6,Kyle,"Let me ask you something, Jimmy: What happens on level 2 after you get the Ontario Nugget?!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Yeah Mom, I'm holding a meeting for all the people who loved The Passion as much as I did.
"
14,8,Cartman,"I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do!  Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit.
"
6,8,Cartman,"So now I can dump them into this little pool and swim in them all day long!  Yeessss. Kyle's monneey. 
"
12,5,Cartman,"I reeached these keeeds.
"
10,10,Kyle,"Oh crap! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change.  No! Must... fight... it... Don't open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here's some water and food from the shelter.
"
16,8,Mr. Mackey,"Hey, get off the field! M'kay?! 
"
4,12,Stan,"Yeah!
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, uh-- Perhaps you should let your wife finish talking, Mr. Marsh. Now, Stan, I want to you to be--
"
1,4,Stan,"Uh. It, it's really cool that we beat the spread against the Cowboys.
"
14,4,Stan,"...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!
"
1,5,Kyle,"No, Cartman, we're going in there and splicing Fluffy and my elephant together.
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Dude! What the fuck!)
"
15,8,Randy,"We worked it out, pal. Surprise!
"
3,13,Cartman,"Dude, what's wrong with you? You got some kind of John Travolta disease?
"
10,7,Cartman,"I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. 
"
11,2,Kyle,"I mean, that if-
"
10,10,Cartman,"Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with.
"
10,4,Kyle,"What manatees??!! 
"
3,2,Stan,"Cartman??
"
6,13,Cartman,"Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. 
"
2,15,Stan,"WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
"
6,3,Stan,"Shhh! Be quiet, Not-Kenny! The Maury Povish freak show is on.
"
2,2,Kyle,"Hey, Cartman.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Royal Crown Chinpoko Master? Holy shit!
"
3,16,Stan,"Please, it's important.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Well you don't expect me to get the WiFi-only 16-gig version, do you?
"
17,9,Kyle,"Cartman, he's got everyone on Sony's side. We can't stop him!
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"I want you all to find somebody in your own life who was in Vietnam and interview them about it.
"
1,2,Stan,"Shut up Cartman!
"
2,11,Stan,"Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
"
12,7,Kenny,"(No they don't wanna see a child die! You guys! Uf.)
"
6,8,Kyle,"Cartman, that's the dumbest thing you've ever said - this week!
"
7,7,Stan,"Come on! Come on! 
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters.
"
1,10,Kenny,"(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)
"
17,5,Kyle,"What?
"
6,4,Stan,"We're sorry, cows. We tried. We tried!
"
8,4,Butters,"Waaah!  No! Jesus, not again!
"
4,15,Cartman,"Take it! I can't eat this crap!
"
4,1,Cartman,"He's a black kid that goes to my school?
"
16,2,Butters,"Sorry! 
"
1,4,Stan,"Like who?
"
6,5,Stan,"The bar! They've got a TV at the bar!
"
5,13,Stan,"I let Kenny down. I'm his worst f-f-f-friend. 
"
17,6,Cartman,"Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. What sounds better in your mouth tomorrow? Thai or Greek?
"
7,1,Kenny,"(Me too.) 
"
14,3,Cartman,"Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce!  Oh God yes!  Where did you get that?!
"
7,5,Butters,"Holy smokes, it's Jennifer Lopez!
"
7,12,Stan,"Oh brother.
"
13,9,Butters,"Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch.  Do you know what I am saying? 
"
11,2,Cartman,"You, you will?
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"No! We just haven't scared them the right way! Think about it. What scares rich people more than anything? 
"
17,6,Kyle,"Mom, there's sssomething I need to tttell you.
"
12,4,Mr. Mackey,"Students, quiet please, m'kay? As you may or may not know, today is Canada Appreciation Day.
"
9,10,Kyle,"I thought you didn't care about Wendy anymore.
"
11,4,Cartman,"Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!
"
16,2,Randy,"Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?
"
17,5,Kyle,"We're so sorry. Please forgive my little brother. He's going through puberty.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Well what are you gnomes sitting there for?! You have to go rescue him!
"
2,11,Stan,"Where have you been, Cartman?
"
4,2,Kyle,"When I say ""go,"" you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear. Okay, Timmy?
"
17,7,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
16,14,Stan,"But I thought Obama won pretty easily last night.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Plunder the booty, lads! This ship is ours!
"
9,14,Randy,"Because I got a DUI and so I'm required to attend AA meetings for two weeks. I was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car. That was dumb and I'm not gonna do it again.
"
3,12,Stan,"Alright. The fifth graders are gonna be here soon. Let's get Kyle's grandma!  This is gonna be sweet
"
3,12,Cartman,"Hey you guys!  You know what time of year it is?
"
18,8,Kyle,"We don't... really know the difference.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"I think I really got a shot at the gold in the swimming competition. Coach says I'm the fastest he's ever seen. Well, I'll see you nice and early for p-practice, Tim-Tim. Oh, uh, can you hand me my bag?
"
10,11,Kyle,"See? You can still make it for the end of the party.
"
17,2,Randy,"Well, hold on, stay by the lake. I wanna kill you now.
"
6,10,Wendy,"...And I was like, ""I'm not buying those shoes for twenty dollars."" 
"
2,17,Kyle,"And that's our report, I guess.
"
2,8,Cartman,"What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!
"
3,16,Stan,"Have I missed anything?
"
2,2,Stan,"Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!
"
13,13,Cartman,"No! You wiped them all out!
"
3,13,Stan,"Damn, dude. Those home-schooled kids are smart.
"
10,14,Stan,"Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?
"
1,12,Cartman,"Eey!  It's not my triangle, it's Kyle's!
"
17,8,Cartman,"That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny's doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn't let him!  I said, ""You can be a chick, Kenny, but there's only one ruler, and that's me!"" 
"
11,10,Kyle,"Just get out of here!
"
17,2,Randy,"Why, why would we punch trees?
"
1,1,Kyle,"Come down here, you stinking aliens!  Uh, uh...
"
6,12,Randy,"The person's ashes are put into an urn, and that's where Kenny's body is.
"
4,11,Stan,"Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. You mean that this whole thing has just been a way for you to make ten million dollars?
"
12,11,Randy,"Go! Go go go go go!  Oho, Oh God, we're going down the stairs now. Okay, getting downstairs. 
"
16,9,Stan,"They don't just allow them, they have them available at the front. 
"
4,9,Stan,"Well, I guess.
"
10,13,Cartman,"So there is no war now in the future.
"
6,12,Stan,"We can keep going, but we need to start tearing down houses for wood.
"
2,10,Kyle,"""So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea.""
"
5,5,Cartman,"You guys! Hey you guys! You guys!
"
9,11,Kyle,"Dude, this is going awesome.
"
1,6,Cartman,"Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!
"
13,7,Cartman,"North Africa. Just picture it, guys: clear blue water with skull islands. Waterfalls and jeweled treasure underneath.
"
10,3,Stan,"Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand.
"
7,8,Kyle,"I got beat up at school... for being different.
"
10,12,Butters,"Oh jumping Jesus! 
"
10,8,Stan,"You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!
"
18,9,Cartman,"I have a YouTube blog where I comment on video games. Big whoop.
"
2,5,Cartman,"So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh? 
"
18,5,Randy,"Eeww.
"
15,12,Cartman,"No.  NOOO!  CLYDE FROG!!  They took Clyde Frog! 
"
2,10,Cartman,"It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?
"
4,13,Cartman,"Okay, that's cool.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Now, don't go saying that. There's always hope. Miracles happen most every day.
To people like you, and me.
But don't expect a miracle.
Unless you help make it to be.
You hope, and I'll hurry.
You pray, and I'll plan
We'll do what's necessary, 'cause
Even a miracle needs a hand!
"
4,15,Kyle,"Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great.
"
7,12,Mr. Garrison,"All right, Gary, why don't you take that empty seat and we'll get started with the lesson? 
"
13,11,Stan,"Can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second?!
"
9,2,Stan,"So it seems like we have enough people now. When do we start taking down the corporations?
"
14,2,Cartman,"So what?
"
5,1,Cartman,"You'll never guess.
"
6,15,Stan,"Look, my friend Kyle won't fly back home to Colorado. All I need you to do is just talk to him and tell him, you know, the whole talking to dead people isn't for real.
"
8,9,Randy,"Look at it, honey. It's so big.
"
1,1,Cartman,"You guys, I have to get home.
"
11,3,Kyle,"This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
"
13,3,Randy,"Yea, it is an angry and unforgiving Economy. To repent we must stop frivolous spending! Instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds! Instead of buying clothes, wear but sheets from thine beds! Cut spending to only the bare essentials! Water and bread and margaritas, yea. 
"
15,7,Stan,"It just looks like shit to me, a bunch of processed, gooey shit.
"
16,14,Kyle,"What?
"
13,7,Cartman,"Wow, cool! Wait a minute. The fuck?! Why would you do that? Unless... you're trying to trick me somehow.
"
15,8,Kyle,"Dude. Have you been drinking?
"
6,4,Kyle,"Stan, we're almost there. You've got to hold on.
"
7,11,Butters,"Finally I can breathe a-  Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It's all destroyed. Nothing left.  Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello?  Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals.  Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma'am?  Oh. Aww, it's a little dog.  Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. 
"
9,1,Kyle,"All right!  Dad, I can play! 
"
18,9,Butters,"Heheyehah.
"
14,8,Butters,"Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? 
"
4,11,Cartman,"Suck my balls!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Fuck you!
"
2,4,Cartman,"What the hell is a ""bris""?
"
3,2,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, here comes the guilt trip again.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Butters, can you keep a secret?
"
18,9,Randy,"You slept with Tupac?! SHARON!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Look.  But I don't think it's for usin', I think it's just for lookin' through. 
"
12,6,Kyle,"I think... I know what's wrong.
"
12,8,Jimmy,"You can't run away from it forever,  Stan! Sooner or later, we all have to face what we fe-fe-fehh fehsow.
"
17,8,Cartman,"Dude, you'd better stop harassing me or I'm callin' the cops!
"
2,6,Stan,"Why would he just invent a story instead of telling us the truth?
"
2,16,Stan,"There's a bunch of policemen chasing after us!
"
6,8,Kyle,"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"You don't love me!  I wanna die!
"
10,9,Kyle,"Aaaah!
"
16,9,Kyle,"Oh no!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison won't let us out of school. He thinks we're making it up.
"
9,5,Stan,"Look! We're gonna be the losers tonight, all right?!
"
5,12,Kyle,"Is that fun?
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh, this is good! Nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball!  Yeah yeah, we're, we're through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled! Let's make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide!  Go on, pat yourselves on the back! 
"
5,9,Stan,"My parents will never let me keep a goat
"
3,13,Stan,"Dude, what happened to you? You're a total wuss now. 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"...You're not?
"
9,1,Butters,"Uhh, it's Kyle! Huh, he's a Negro! 
"
16,11,Stan,"""On the morrow""? What the fuck is wrong with Kenny?
"
5,6,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, that is a lot of money. Don't you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house?
"
2,14,Kyle,"You bastard!
"
9,8,Kyle,"Stan, it's over. You have to admit what you did so our parents could help us! 
"
1,2,Cartman,"...I'm gonna be on television, I'm gonna be on television...
"
6,10,Cartman,"Heheh, yeah.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Not much huh?! My mom is so poor, when she heard about the Last Supper she thought she was running out of food stamps!
"
11,14,Stan,"Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
"
2,15,Stan,"Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. 
"
2,16,Kenny,"(Okay) 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"We just have one question before we join your c-club. Do you think it's better to be born a Crip, or to become a Crip later by accident?
"
14,4,Kyle,"Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!
"
5,9,Cartman,"...Not really.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Come on, Craig!
"
12,10,Randy,"What are?!
"
6,10,Butters,"Me too!
"
11,8,Kyle,"I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly!  Whoa.
"
5,2,Stan,"I just... called Cartman a name- he's a, he's a silly goose.
"
9,6,Cartman,"I know how.
"
15,8,Cartman,"It's alright. I think another batch is just finishing off in our top-secret flavor enhancer.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Eh! God-damnit! 
"
9,9,Cartman,"Dude, I think it's totally working. The girls are totally buying it. 
"
3,3,Stan,"Dude! Chef's wedding is in three hours. We've got that much time to find out how to destroy a Succubus.
"
12,9,Wendy,"God! 
"
4,11,Butters,"Jesus!
"
12,10,Kyle,"I think Kenny likes it. 
"
1,10,Kyle,"Stan!
"
2,12,Randy,"Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?
"
15,12,Cartman,"Somebody's been in my room!  Fucking 99%ers! What did they take?!
"
12,1,Kyle,"Why do I have HIV?!
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired!
"
17,6,Kyle,"Dude! Do not do this!
"
6,9,Kyle,"Do with us what you will, Mr. Lucas!  But please, don't change Raiders of the Lost Ark.
"
7,5,Cartman,"There we go, Saright?
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Oh! Oh God! Oh God he killed himself! Eric Cartman killed himself! Did you see that? Oh why would he do it?  Oh wait uh here, here's a suicide note. Mkay.  Dear Guys, I just cannot go on mkay. I'm tired of being FAT, mkay, and I have to end it all. Mkay. -Eric Cartman.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Oh-kay.
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey, stop running!
"
13,14,Stan,"We got it, Dad.
"
9,6,Butters,"Well I saw...  Well he was...  Nothin' I-I just had a nightmare.
"
16,3,Cartman,"No, no. It was kind of stupid, really.
"
3,1,Kenny,"(My name's Kenny.)
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"FLAT! You're FLAT!
"
1,7,Cartman,"Where the hell is Kyle, we don't have all night to wait for him.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Nno!
"
7,4,Randy,"If it means war, then we say NO!
"
3,8,Stan,"Super weak.
"
11,12,Kyle,"No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination.
"
11,4,Cartman,"The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.
"
8,2,Cartman,"Why?
"
3,4,Stan,"Come on, you guys. 
"
12,5,Cartman,"Principal Victoria. Right over here. Nnnnnh!
"
10,12,Butters,"Oh hamburgers!! 
"
14,2,Stan,"More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!
"
3,3,Kyle,"There he is! 
"
6,14,Mr. Mackey,"Good luck, m'kay.
"
1,11,Cartman,"I'm a bigger lesbian than you!
"
17,3,Cartman,"I can't think here. I need a magazine and a toilet. 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Ah! Eh. Nuh!  Less than a minute! Less than a minute!
"
5,9,Cartman,"Yeah. 
"
1,9,Kenny,"(Kyle has Jesus' head instead!)
"
6,14,Kyle,"""Fat tits."" That's a good one.
"
6,7,Butters,"Look! Look! I've made the news! I-I've wreaked havoc!
"
14,5,Cartman,"Put it on!  Do the voice.
"
4,17,Kyle,"He's gonna be here any minute, Ike.
"
2,16,Kyle,"I wanted to make sure, too.
"
1,4,Kyle,"What'd he say?
"
8,11,Cartman,"Wait, I've got it.  Crab people.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Step back! Tell those men to step back!
"
2,16,Cartman,"All right, keeps your pants on.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Whoa!
"
10,6,Cartman,"I can't kick!
"
14,6,Cartman,"Ahaaa!
"
15,12,Cartman,"I know, Clyde Frog, but now the 99% is saying everything is my faaault.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Why the hell do I have to share my room with other patients?! This is bullcrap!
"
12,3,Stan,"Kenny, I know we're super-cool and everything, but if we ever catch you cheesing again, we're gonna tell on you.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Well then, I wish you both well in your new venture. Good-bye. 
"
5,5,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, you're the guy on the screen. 
"
17,1,Butters,"Well, there's a lot of interesting stuff in here, Craig. There's even some quotes from President Obama.  Could you read this part out lout?
"
14,5,Randy,"There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us.
"
13,8,Stan,"Yeahhhh!
"
5,8,Stan,"What?
"
9,10,Kyle,"What the hell are you talking about?!
"
16,5,Kyle,"With Cartman singing about his vagina.
"
8,5,Butters,"Yep. That's right. He's a real live robot. He can walk and talk and everything. You're like the fourth kid I told already.  Well I gotta go Dougie. My robot and I have stuff to do.  Heheh, they're all so jealous!  I'm so glad you came into my life, AWESOM-O. You're the best friend a guy could have.
"
3,1,Kyle,"No, dude. That's a branch.
"
15,7,Randy,"Face it Sharon, our son turned 10 and you feel old!
"
1,10,Mr. Garrison,"Wai-wa I was here first.
"
3,3,Stan,"We wanna talk to Chef.
"
2,4,Cartman,"Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"All right, now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window; that's the easiest access.
"
6,4,Butters,"Oh, sweet Jesus.
"
12,13,Stan,"Stop. 
"
4,16,Cartman,"Aaahh!  You sons of bitches!  You see what we're dealing with here. Tonight is Carousel. And they will try to kill one of us. Eh, you two seem to have the uncanny ability to cross the white line. If you help us, we'll get you what you need. 
"
7,6,Cartman,"Right. I think I know exactly where to start.
"
11,13,Stan,"This is um, Thad Jarvis.
"
10,14,Randy,"Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.
"
7,9,Kyle,"That's us!  ""Dear MOOP. This letter is to inform you that Faith Plus One's debut album has just sold one million copies.""
"
8,8,Stan,"Mom, a-I just don't think there's much of a difference between a douche and a turd. I d-I don't care.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Arkansas?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?
"
2,18,Stan,"Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!
"
1,6,Stan,"That's my silly grampa. 
"
7,6,Butters,"Okay!!
"
14,5,Stan,"No, you can't even show his feet.
"
16,12,Kenny,"Yeah, Stan?
"
4,12,Stan,"Dude, look at the walls.  Everything is written in some strange, foreign language.
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Now, Timmy,—
"
15,5,Kyle,"...What?
"
5,6,Kyle,"My life can't get any worse!
"
16,7,Cartman,"NOOOOOOO! 
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"Ho-okay, children, we have some new students joining us today. Let's all be warm and welcome them to our class. 
"
6,10,Butters,"Uh here comes an SUV. 
"
11,7,Cartman,"California Supercool to the homeless
"
18,9,Randy,"Iggs, I really don't care to go through this again with you.
"
7,7,Stan,"Dad.  Good luck.
"
10,6,Stan,"Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
"
5,8,Cartman,"I'm almost done, you smartasses! I'm just wipin' mah- whoa, what the hell is that?  You guys, look what I found in the trashcan in Stan's bathroom. It's like a bloody cotton thing wrapped in toilet paper.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Cool, thanks. Let's get to work! Now let's see... something that's a play on words, I don't know... fishsticks. You know, 'cause it, 'cause dicks
"
13,9,Butters,"The next key to a successful business is ""innovation."" I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?
"
4,2,Stan,"What are you talking about, Cartman?! We're only $167 away from gettin' a Sega!
"
2,11,Stan,"Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-
"
16,13,Cartman,"Well don't you care?! Jesus Asterisk Christ, Stan! People are feeling really cheated by all this!
"
15,7,Cartman,"Yaaaay!  Oh cool, look. A Ben 10 Wrist Rocket! This is exactly what I wanted for Stan's birthday! What'd you get Stan?
"
7,3,Stan,"Mrs. Streible thinks she's so cool!
"
9,14,Stan,"That's probably okay if you spread it out.
"
16,8,Stan,"Look, I'm sorry guys, my dad said he's too busy with the Broncos. He doesn't have time for us.
"
3,6,Stan,"Yeah, dude. That's my favorite toy.
"
6,17,Stan,"Hang on, Santa! 
"
3,16,Kenny,"(See, a tampon is what you stick up your ass so you don't bleed.)
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
2,12,Wendy,"Wow, that sucks!
"
16,4,Butters,"Nope. I don't think... Christ has any basis in reality.
"
13,11,Stan,"Mister Prime Minister, Japanese officials, there's something you need to know. The photo you were given of the Enola Gay was doctored. Because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they... simply pointed the finger at somebody else. My government has authorized me to give you the original photo, unaltered, so you can finally know the truth.  Dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers.  A chicken and a cow.
"
3,1,Stan,"SNAAAKE! 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Captain Cartman reporting from Shuttlecraft Spontaneity. Approaching planet Omega Nine.
"
12,2,Kyle,"All right, fine! We don't need you, Butters!
"
4,16,Kyle,"Dear Mr. Castro:  I am an eight-year-old American boy who lives in South Park.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Guys.  Guys, I need your help.
"
4,9,Kyle,"I wanna be the tough one!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Dude, it's a dude! 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Nooo!
"
8,8,Kyle,"You're doing the right thing, Stan. Don't you feel like you're a part of something now?
"
2,4,Cartman,"Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?
"
8,1,Stan,"No dude, you gotta help us find him!
"
13,5,Cartman,"And then it was on Leno and the Jimmy Kimmel show! Dude, that's our joke on national television.
"
15,10,Kyle,"How do you know?!
"
5,9,Cartman,"Hey look! An infidel! 
"
12,13,Stan,"Look, I just want you to know, if you want to, you know, be with that Bridon kid, then you should.
"
16,7,Kyle,"Well... what kind of stuff does she like? Do you know?
"
10,7,Cartman,"Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?!  Fine! I'll do it by myself!
"
17,8,Cartman,"Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the Game of Thrones model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.
"
4,6,Cartman,"You see, unfortunately I have matured faster than all my friends. I wanna hang out with older friends, but I can't find any, so I was wondering if you could genetically engineer some older friends for me.
"
1,11,Kyle,"Screw you guys, I'm king lesbian!
"
10,7,Cartman,"Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-
"
17,2,Stan,"We want specific networks dropped from our cable.
"
16,1,Cartman,"What? Yes I'd mind! Do you mind if I touch your fucking balls?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(I'd like a box of condoms, please.)
"
4,13,Stan,"Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
"
8,4,Randy,"You got served? By who?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Clear the streets! Everyone clear the streets! We've gotta get the fuck out of here!  Mom it's starting! We've gotta go!  Come on, come on!  Come on, we've gotta move! It's spreading! Let's go! 
"
12,9,Stan,"What am I supposed to do about it? 
"
4,13,Kyle,"Screw you, fat ass!
"
3,14,Cartman,"I don't. I made it up. 
"
9,1,Stan,"Dude, is Kyle's- dad a- dolphin?
"
15,14,Cartman,"How?!
"
10,9,Stan,"Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you.  There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"No. See, you got beeped.
"
4,15,Cartman,"I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?
"
13,8,Kenny,"(Holy shit, dude!)
"
9,8,Cartman,"Yeah. Isn't this fun? Just you and me hangin' out, Stan. No stupid Kyle around.
"
13,7,Butters,"It's just l-leavin' everything behind, uh, uh I can't believe I'm actually doing it.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Don't be sad, Ike. Just be happy that you live in a country where people get to elect a president at all.  Hello?
"
6,6,Cartman,"All right, everyone, the time has come for us to narrow the list down from ten to six. But first, let us just say that the people who we didn't pick were only not picked because they totally sucked balls. Kyle?
"
3,15,Cartman,"Time to go, Mr. Hankey.
"
6,2,Cartman,"You know, when somebody is sleeping and you put your finger up your butt and then, wipe it on their upper lip to give them a little Hitler mustache? You've never Hitlered anyone?
"
4,7,Cartman,"Shut up, Fluffy! 
"
18,2,Wendy,"Thought so. 
"
1,8,Stan,"That was awesome!
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"...No, Eric! That's not what I'm talking about! The school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools. Please welcome Petey, the Sexual Harassment Panda. 
"
16,12,Randy,"It's finally happened, Sharon!  I did it!  Here you are, my lady. A brand new leather coat, pour vous.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Really? What did you like best about it?
"
2,10,Cartman,"More calamine lotion!
"
4,11,Cartman,"The Lord has spoken again-uh! O, forgive us, Lord, for our sins-uh!
"
6,13,Randy,"It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?
"
3,13,Mr. Garrison,"Well, very impressive, Mark. You should be able to throw the grading curve and flunk all these little bastards. 
"
6,13,Kyle,"It has to go back!
"
6,13,Jimmy,"Go!  You shall not...pah..? You shall not..puh...  You shall not paah...  You shall not pa--!  You shall not paah--!  You shall not puh-uh-uh--  You shall not pass. 
"
6,7,Butters,"Good! Then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us!
"
6,7,Stan,"Do you see the sea people.
"
3,17,Cartman,"No? How about this? 
"
16,14,Jimmy,"Just old junk, and boxes of Eric's mom's d-dildos
"
10,6,Kyle,"I need your help!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Eh! 
"
8,11,Cartman,"...You're gay!
"
3,12,Kyle,"Cartman?!
"
4,8,Wendy,"D'aaaaahhh!
"
15,13,Kyle,"Dude, shut your fuckin' mouth!
"
12,8,Stan,"Why aliens? Aliens don't belong in an Indiana Jones movie?  Come on dude! There's nothing we can do!
"
9,1,Mr. Garrison,"Ough, ergh. Eww. 
"
13,8,Stan,"Dude, the two male judges love her.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Well hello everyone. 
"
8,10,Kenny,"(Oh yeah!) 
"
17,6,Stan,"They're really that good?
"
14,5,Kyle,"We can't give him over to the gingers!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Oh, we're just gonna watch some TV, maybe play a board game.
"
7,12,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats.  We have a new student joining us today who has just moved here from Utah. I want you all to say hi to Gary. 
"
7,14,Wendy,"Look, Stan is really nice. I just don't wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I've been wanting to break up for a while. but it's, it's nothing against him.
"
6,9,Cartman,"...I believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman, Tweek. 
"
9,3,Cartman,"...Oooo...
"
6,9,Stan,"Really? That's great.
"
7,7,Stan,"No! We won't let you destroy our town!
"
18,10,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Nuh uh! Wuh. Huh. Waaagh! Ungh! 
"
16,3,Butters,"What?! You mean you guys still plan on Faith Hilling after what we just saw?
"
1,12,Cartman,"Make it go away! I hate Barbra Streisand! I hate her! 
"
11,3,Cartman,"Well who was it?  It was Kenny, right?
"
2,9,Kyle,"What is it?
"
4,7,Stan,"You suck, Cartman!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, for Pete's sake, Clyde. You just went!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? 
"
11,7,Kyle,"Fine.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Okay, guys, eh... If you'll excuse me, I must be going now. 
"
1,13,Stan,"Go ahead, dude. 
"
6,5,Butters,"Oh, Jesus. Ah, I gotta run like the wind. 
"
12,8,Kenny,"(Damn.)
"
13,6,Randy,"Come on, Stan, you can do this! 
"
7,11,Kyle,"I told him 5:30 and we gotta get going. You in?
"
9,10,Kyle,"Who?
"
14,6,Kyle,"Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.
"
9,14,Randy,"This is my only hope, Stan! Either you drive this car or I will!
"
3,14,Stan,"God damnit, that fat piece of shit!
"
9,6,Cartman,"All right, Butters, I'm going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.
"
18,5,Randy,"Look, we're all here because what happened to Laura could happen to any of us. There's nobody regulating these drones and if we don't do something now, we're gonna be up to our navels with bush.  Oh um, up to our necks in trouble. Sorry. 
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Oh I see.
"
11,14,Cartman,"Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time."" When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground.
"
17,1,Butters,"Yes! Yes I will! Oh, thank youhoohoo! I will! Oh, I feel so much better already! 
Livin' in America!
Eye to eye! Hand to hand!
Across the nation!
Smokestack, fatback,
Many miles of railroad track
Ow! I said Ow ow!
"
4,3,Stan,"Damn, dude. 
"
11,4,Cartman,"Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh?  That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice.
"
13,9,Butters,"Uugh!
"
6,11,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, kids, so, now, who can tell me what year the first moon landing took place?  Uh, how about you, Clyde?
"
2,7,Kyle,"What are we gonna do?
"
13,14,Kyle,"Well then they're not minorities, are they?
"
2,5,Stan,"Yeah, shut up, Pip.  Can we go home now?
"
11,8,Cartman,"But I'm not gonna do the-
"
1,4,Cartman,"No I didn't. That was just my shoes.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"I don't want to go to rehab! I haven't even done drugs in weeks!
"
3,10,Cartman,"Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!
"
3,12,Stan,"Boo!
"
2,13,Stan,"How long was that?
"
13,7,Cartman,"That's it! Get in there you swarmy dogs!  Lower 'em down, Ike. 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Wow, these guys really are crippled.  Timmy, I have a feeling that this is the start of something b-b-b-b...b-b-brilliant.
"
7,6,Stan,"You said you set the pie in the window sill, where it must have sat for some time.  But its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody. 
"
10,10,Kyle,"Really?! What's there not to understand?!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth!  Let's see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse,  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one,  think again. 
"
8,13,Cartman,"Proper channels?
"
3,13,Kyle,"Wooww.
"
3,16,Kenny,"(Ooooowwwwwwwhh.) 
"
5,9,Stan,"They're not.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Yeah, this is sweet!
"
1,4,Stan,"Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut--hut. hut. hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.
"
2,11,Stan,"He hits this switch- 
"
2,13,Kenny,"(I don't know where he went!)
"
16,1,Cartman,"Now listen. All we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down. If they can't raise or lower, there's zero chance of anyone falling in.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Because they taste so yummy. 
"
10,10,Kyle,"Can we get going now, please?!
"
5,3,Kyle,"Cartman, no!
"
2,13,Cartman,"I hate you guys!
"
1,10,Cartman,"I HATE YOU! I WANT YOU TO DIE! DIE!!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink.
"
7,14,Jimmy,"For- Forw- Forw-w-w what?
"
8,4,Stan,"Aw, what do we do, Chef?!
"
10,13,Cartman,"What?!
"
12,12,Kyle,"We made it, Ike. You're going to be okay. 
"
7,12,Butters,"He's a peckerface, that's what he is!
"
2,9,Cartman,"I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!
"
14,3,Cartman,"I know, it sucks. 
"
17,8,Kenny,"(You can change your mind instead of fighting with us, Eric.)
"
7,9,Cartman,"You just start that way, Stan, then you cross over. It's genius!
"
2,10,Stan,"Yeah.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"We're not bad. I mean, maybe what we needed was just to think outside the box here. I mean, if there's anything we've learned is that the only thing that makes a juicy story go away is a juicier story.
"
1,1,Wendy,"Hey, what about that?
"
3,4,Stan,"Tweek and Craig are fighting. We're just watching. 
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"""Well, I'm not gong' to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!""
"
10,2,Kyle,"The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls.
"
4,4,Stan,"Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?
"
15,8,Cartman,"Okay, you're on, Jew! 
"
17,6,Cartman,"Yeah, come on over here. I got some more stuff in my locker, Kyle. 
"
7,7,Stan,"Our whole town, gone. We'd had such great times here. 
"
7,1,Kyle,"It's not Helen Hunt's ass. It's an alien space ship.
"
2,12,Stan,"I didn't even think about that.
"
11,13,Stan,"I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! 
"
7,1,Stan,"Uh oh. This must be the head alien guy.
"
2,8,Stan,"He's taking swimming lessons.
"
6,12,Stan,"Hey Kenny.
"
16,9,Kyle,"When we said ""documentary,"" I thought we meant 60 Minutes, not Honey Boo Boo!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Look, Timmy. There's a convenience store.  That must be what the fellas meant by ""pop some punk-ass Bloods."" They want us to get them some soda pop and treats.  Let's buy them ginger ale and marshmallows. Then they'll let us in the club for sure.
"
6,16,Stan,"Oh dude, I should have never touched that marijuana!
"
1,2,Cartman,"Ohh, rainbows. Yeah, I like those, those are cool.
"
2,15,Randy,"There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
"
18,3,Wendy,"What the hell do you think you're doing?
"
18,6,Stan,"That's what I've been addicted to. It's a freemium game sending me push notifications. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"That, that's very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.
"
18,1,Butters,"Hang on, is this the company where I don't get raped? Yeah, he-here, right? Okay, I'm uh stayin' here.
"
1,7,Stan,"Taser... 
"
3,12,Stan,"Okay. Let's just hide her here, and tomorrow, during the Halloween party, we'll come back in our costumes and use her to scare the fifth graders.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Okay, we're ready for the-  What the hell did you assholes do?! This is supposed to be the big finale where the turkey jumps through the ring of fire!
"
9,10,Stan,"I don't. She's totally lame. 
"
11,13,Kyle,"Hey dude, how'd it-? 
"
6,11,Randy,"There is no other team.
"
8,7,Stan,"Well dude, they are taking people's jobs away.
"
9,12,Kyle,"How come you didn't buy any cards, Stan?
"
14,4,Cartman,"You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him.
"
6,3,Butters,"Well I can certainly see why.
"
1,5,Kyle,"Come on Stan, don't you even know where you would go?
"
15,14,Cartman,"My case worker?  Oh, not this guy!
"
16,2,Cartman,"Butters, what the fuck?!
"
16,6,Stan,"No!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Can I talk to you for a second, just for a second, right over here?  Listen uh, I heard through the grapevine that you've got a thing for Kyle?
"
3,11,Stan,"Whatever. Let's go see what's on TV.
"
4,2,Stan,"Really?
"
15,9,Cartman,"Where the fuck did he go?!  Haha! Game over, Butters! You lose!  The fuck is this?!  No. NO! 
"
3,4,Cartman,"Well, well, well, look who's here! Our little home economics friend, Kenny!
"
4,17,Cartman,"My mom could make a better Christmas special than this!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Wow, the Declaration of Independence Day.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Come on! Loosen up! Meteor showers only come once in a great while. 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Ahh-d, excuse me, sir, did I hear you say you needed somebody for your show?
"
6,6,Cartman,"I think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was Jimmy. 
"
9,13,Kyle,"You're going home, Willzy-x! 
"
2,15,Kyle,"That's not cool!
"
11,2,Butters,"Yeah Kyle?
"
2,10,Stan,"You know, freshen up your breath.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Abortion isn't wrong! What's the one thing I've been teaching you?
"
10,1,Stan,"Come on, Chef!
"
4,7,Stan,"Go on, Butters!
"
5,9,Kenny,"(God-damn, it stinks like shit!)
"
17,1,Cartman,"I know, right?  A big rally to tell the government to stay out of our private lives! I'm gonna e-mail everybody and put it up on my blog pages!  I seriously feel like I'm being spied on right now.  I'm sure the government has a file on me a mile long; that's why this is so important, you know?  Hang on, I'm gonna make a video blog for my ""Stop Listening To Me"" Web site.  What's up everybody? It's me again, just kicking it at my skeal. There's gonna be a big rally to tell the government to stop gathering information on us! Gonna tweet you all the details, but keep quiet, 'cause it's top secret!  You guys gonna update your blogs too?
"
2,7,Stan,"Dude, I think the scary monster is right outside the bus!
"
10,3,Kyle,"You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah! Why do we have to be their bitches every year?!
"
5,8,Stan,"God-damnit, I guess we're gonna have to climb the stupid fence.
"
15,9,Kyle,"Better than being a fatass Texan!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Yeah dude, it's fuckin' boring as shit!
"
16,7,Butters,"It's gonna be okay, Eric.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Well, where is it?  What the hell is that?!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Arkansas is where I grew up. My parents live there—my  ...father still lives there.
"
14,5,Mr. Garrison,"No Mr. Hat, don't say any more!
"
7,7,Mr. Mackey,"We have plenty enough to save our town now!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Ms. Crabtree?
"
10,6,Stan,"Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig.
"
10,10,Kyle,"Who's Beth?
"
14,4,Kyle,"No. What's chatroulette?
"
6,8,Stan,"What?
"
17,1,Butters,"Uh huh.  Did you follow all that, Craig?  Uh, I don't think I really followed all that.
"
13,14,Stan,"Aaaah!  Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
12,13,Stan,"That isn't true!  Okay, that's totally true. But you guys, we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids
"
5,2,Cartman,"Yeah, he's excited.
"
18,2,Stan,"There's a health crisis going on, and it's spreading faster than anyone realizes. For a long time we ignored it. Thought it would only affect the poor. People who ate Eggo waffles and Pizza Pockets. But gluten can attack anyone. This is not a time to party. This is a time to get serious. We're calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family. Because we don't know how much time we have.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Fly, fly little dove, to the welcome arms of Christ above. Your tears are finally gone to-
"
3,7,Cartman,"You're not ugly.
"
10,3,Cartman,"Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong.
"
16,3,Kenny,"(Oh, fuck it, dude.) 
"
1,1,Cartman,"No, Kitty, it's mah pot pie!  Mom! Kitty's being a dildo!
"
3,2,Kyle,"Really? Great! I don't have to worry about that anymore. 
"
13,3,Cartman,"Hengh!  Of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things, it had to be the week that Grand Theft Auto 4 comes out for Nintendo DS!  Hengh!
"
12,8,Cartman,"No! The Chinese, no! Somebody has to stop them!  No! No!
"
12,4,Stan,"What'd they say?
"
4,9,Randy,"...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...
"
13,14,Stan,"That's true dude, didn't you see The Abyss?
"
15,9,Stan,"What are you talking about?
"
4,14,Cartman,"Alright, got to write the new lyrics. Lemme see.  no  No.  NO!  God-damnit 
"
10,1,Kyle,"No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??
"
2,18,Stan,"Let him out, dude. He's scared.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Ah he's just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He's got boneritis.  Right guys? 
"
6,17,Kyle,"Wow, cool!
"
5,5,Cartman,"Agh! Wough! Man, it smells down there! 
"
17,1,Cartman,"And then all I have to do is go back to this place every time I do something wrong and admit it and I'm forgiven again?
"
14,8,Butters,"That's fuckin' gay as hell.
"
6,5,Kyle,"They're goin' to show the new Terrance & Phillip trailer
"
1,8,Kyle,"Ask her if we get the watch right away.
"
2,18,Cartman,"I told you guys.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Excuse me, what the hell are you doing?
"
5,13,Kenny,"(All right. I'm fine.)
"
9,3,Kyle,"Woohoo! Yeah!
"
16,3,Kyle,"Kenny?
"
1,5,Cartman,"Heyyy, these bunny ears are tied on with little strings.
"
1,7,Cartman,"Are you crazy?! I'm the candy master.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Dirty bitch.
"
6,6,Jimmy,"Well, the, the reason I think I would make the perfect foreh- friend, is that I love telling jokes. You know, who doesn't like to laugh?
"
6,2,Stan,"What's a Hitler?
"
11,12,Cartman,"What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe.
"
7,14,Stan,"Dude, I don't have time to start over with other girls. I'm nine years old, dude! If I don't work things out with Wendy, I could be alone my whole life!
"
5,12,Butters,"...And so, just like in nature, ah I can add the mixture into the volcano and...  O Pele! God of Fire! Show us you uh-  Aw, it's all uh g-gooey.
"
1,12,Stan,"Whoa, dude! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
"
9,2,Cartman,"What?
"
10,14,Randy,"Oh, well that's good.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Don't look at me! Uh, y'all go on your bastard trip and just- don't look at me! 
"
3,11,Cartman,"No wait. I'll tell you.  He's, he's a little starving Ethiopian kid. We adopted him.
"
10,6,Cartman,"Grab my hand.
"
7,10,Kenny,"(Ohhhhh, look!)  (You guys!)
"
15,5,Kyle,"Gut they're the ones risking injury.
"
5,7,Randy,"No, Stan! What you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual.
"
1,7,Stan,"You what?!
"
16,5,Butters,"HA! OH. Ah. Hi Grandma.
"
2,14,Cartman,"No more Salisbury steak and… pecan pie. 
"
15,6,Butters,"Waaaa! 
"
4,16,Kyle,"Yeah. We're fine.
"
15,1,Stan,"What?
"
1,7,Kyle,"Hey dudes.
"
13,11,Kenny,"(And they're all shot.) 
"
18,9,Randy,"This ends now. I'm gonna tell people the truth.
"
11,5,Randy,"Wha... what do you mean, ""Why do we do this?"" It's Easter!
"
9,3,Stan,"There it is! American Idol contestants!
"
1,10,Stan,"Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.  You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'
"
1,1,Stan,"How can you eat when you're farting fire?
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah, Butters. You wouldn't make a very good ninja. Come on, guys.  We have a lot of work to do.
"
17,1,Butters,"Yes!
"
2,17,Cartman,"Well, look at him. He's all, you know, uh l-look at him. 
"
15,11,Randy,"I got plane tickets and a hotel room! We leave in three hours!
"
11,10,Butters,"Wow.
"
3,14,Cartman,"Yes. E-e-enjoy your freedom, gentlemen. Soon, you will be my properteh. Come, Kenny. Come fight for us, and I'll make sure you get lots of plunder and womens.
"
7,11,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
15,12,Stan,"Dude, what the hell?
"
4,14,Cartman,"...Alright, fine! Get in costume!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Whatever it is, it's getting closer.  Ow! What the hell was that for!
"
16,2,Randy,"Just trying to leave without being rude.
"
2,13,Mr. Garrison,"You know, uh, excuse me, but I agree. These rides are really stupid! Chamber of Farts isn't scary at all!
"
13,5,Kyle,"Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Newton was the first to discover that for every action there's a reaction - thank you Butters. Now what do you think is gonna happen when I introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of Mr. Slave's ass?  Well let's see. 
"
3,3,Kyle,"We have to talk to him!
"
6,16,Stan,"This is my future self. He came during the electrical storm last night and is caught in a time matrix. He's me when I'm 32.
"
8,13,Stan,"Dude, I really don't think it's smart, Cartman. 
"
10,10,Cartman,"Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool.
"
1,12,Stan,"Get us down from here!
"
16,13,Cartman,"...Oh, I guess I do care about that. Huh.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Please, Ma. I don't think Kenny has anywhere else to be tonight.
"
16,3,Kyle,"Yeah. Do it, Cartman.
"
6,14,Randy,"Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?
"
7,8,Kenny,"(Woohoohoo!)
"
7,12,Cartman,"Will he bleed? That's all we care about.
"
6,6,Stan,"Oh, this is giving me a headache.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Yo, don't be dissing my niggaz, dawg. They're my f... friends.
"
13,4,Stan,"I'm going too. 
"
9,6,Butters,"Ahhh. 
"
3,13,Cartman,"Mom?
"
13,13,Cartman,"Wendy, I wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question, and I hope you don't take offense to it.
"
7,5,Cartman,"Ohnonono, Ms. Lopez.
"
15,5,Kyle,"What are you doing here?
"
13,5,Cartman,"What are you, Clyde? A gay fish?
"
6,2,Kyle,"Yeah, what a stupid sport! 
"
5,2,Jimmy,"How about Jimmy Stewart? ""Merry Christmas, movie house."" And John Travolta. ""Oh my God, Mr. Kotter! Mr. Kotter, oh, oh my God, Mr. Kotter!""
"
5,7,Stan,"You guys, we just wanna know if you-
"
11,9,Randy,"Mine... mine was bigger.
"
18,6,Stan,"...Free? 
"
3,5,Kyle,"There it is!  That must be of the antelope family.
"
16,11,Butters,"Hey yeah, all the time.
"
18,3,Butters,"Yeah! Stan's a big old fat cissy!
"
9,4,Cartman,"That's right. Respect our authoritah.
"
3,10,Randy,"Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys.
"
5,13,Kyle,"...I hate you so much. 
"
7,9,Stan,"Yeah, and I'm more hip-hop and R-and-B oriented. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"Attention! Attention please!  This is a message for all of you out there who have just ended a relationship. Sometimes, love is hard. But you can't just run away from it. When you start to have something special you have to work at it!  Even though it might seem like the world is against you, you still have to hold on! With both hands!  Don't let society dictate who you can and can't be with. Kyle, I love you babe. You can run all you want, try to pretend you like girls, but damnit, when we kiss there's magic! Don't let it go, Kyle. 
"
2,10,Cartman,"Uugh!  Yeessss.  Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh... 
"
4,10,Stan,"I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna do.
"
3,2,Stan,"Dude, he's still not dead.
"
15,5,Cartman,"It's a good life, Kyle. We've come here every night for Denny's Baconalia specials.
"
8,4,Stan,"It's all right. My friend Chef is gonna coach us.
"
18,9,Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah!
"
18,2,Kyle,"Cartman?
"
8,12,Butters,"Before what happens? 
"
15,5,Stan,"Aw dude, that's so sad. 
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"That's right! In fact, I'm gonna call the jelly school right now, okay?!  I'm sorry about this, but it's gone too far! I've had it! Hello, is this the jelly school?! ... Okay, I have a girl here who's extremely jelly! Uh, see if you can take her in for a few weeks! Okay, you're full? Okay, yeah, I guess she dodged a bullet this time, but she'd better watch her jelly behavior!
"
13,10,Stan,"Yup.
"
18,7,Butters,"I can't  I can't breathe too good. Eric, I can't see. Are you still there? Oh... I think I overdid it. I have to take this thing off. What the hell? What the hell is that?! AAAH!
"
13,9,Butters,"But I heard ACORN helps pimps and their bitches!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Slowly the rage built inside his mind.  ""Why won't she let me eat that pie? Why does she always stop me from doing what I wanna do?!"" His only solution became obvious: Kill her!
"
5,10,Cartman,"...Naw, see? Somethng's wrong. I'm not laughing.
"
9,8,Stan,"Jesus Christ!!!
"
11,13,Stan,"Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!
"
16,5,Butters,"We don't have a choice, Butters. You have to defend yourself!  Oh, but violence is never the answer.  But she's gonna kill you, Butters! You know she is!  You're right, Butters! I don't have a choice!  Sorry, Grandma, but you brought this on yourself!  It's time you met... Chaos!  I've been pushed around for the last time!  Now I'm coming! And heck's coming with me! 
"
12,14,Butters,"Two weeks ago. It used to be a Banaaana Repuuubliiic.
"
6,13,Cartman,"You're gay!
"
4,1,Kyle,"Phil Collins Hill on Saturday! You got it!
"
9,5,Butters,"We'd better hope they never know, or else there's gonna be heck to pay. Heck, I tell ya!
"
1,9,Cartman,"I don't know, but it sounds pretty sweet.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Wow...
"
18,6,Randy,"It's not fun! You two have demons you're trying to compensate for!
"
17,6,Kyle,"That's, that that's k-kind of what I was thinking.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, great! Flora's undecided! Well, you're just gonna have to sit there, Flora, and think about it until you come up with an answer.
"
18,9,Wendy,"Hi everybody. I love you!
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Come on, Squirts, we gotta run! We're already god-damned late!)
"
12,8,Cartman,"Because the Chinese hate Americans! That's why I've started: the American Liberation Front. A group dedicated to freeing American from Chinese tyranny.  Will you join me?
"
2,11,Kyle,"Like you really need it, hippo-ass!
"
6,17,Kyle,"That's a retarded idea that won't work. Why are you really doing this?
"
13,12,Kenny,"(Jesus fucking Christ!)
"
14,2,Butters,"No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!
"
18,9,Wendy,"So can you explain to our audience members over the age of five what it is that you DO?
"
16,13,Stan,"What would Jesus do?  Yeheah! 
"
17,6,Kyle,"Okay, okay. Stan, you're right. Maybe I let being a martyr go to my head. Just please, let me stay on this path, and, I'll try to be cool about it. Okay? I'm sorry.
"
4,11,Kenny,"(Eric! Eric!)
"
17,3,Cartman,"It's Token. I think he's a ticking time bomb.
"
12,6,Randy,"You don't understand.  I need the Internet to jack off. I... got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button, you know? Once you jack off to Japanese girls puking in each other's mouths you can't exactly go back to Playboy!
"
6,17,Cartman,"God-damnit I have to get that Haibo robot doll, you sonofabitch!
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of Medical Center. He thought. ""Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?"" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see? 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry!
"
6,6,Butters,"Alright. I'm goin' to the bathroom now. If anybody needs me, ah that's where I'll be.
"
9,8,Stan,"Huh oh. 
"
1,4,Kyle,"Uh, Chef?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Uh-huh.
"
2,10,Stan,"That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
"
14,2,Kenny,"(Awesome, dude!)
"
13,10,Jimmy,"Your girlfriend is a whore!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Butters, it was my pleasure. 
"
1,7,Cartman,"My mom made it, isn't it cool?
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"I've always wanted to write a novel.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Hoh, that sucks, dude.
"
17,9,Butters,"What's that?  Awww! 
"
2,6,Mr. Mackey,"You're here because you are inferior, m'kay? You are here because you are awkward, m'kay?
"
3,17,Stan,"You did? 
"
14,6,Cartman,"Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
"
13,7,Cartman,"The FUCK?!
"
5,10,Stan,"Dude, the ass-faces' son is Ben Affleck!
"
13,14,Kyle,"Eewww! 
"
16,9,Cartman,"Oh yeah, it's nice. Yeah, that works pretty well. 
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.
"
8,9,Cartman,"You butthole, Kyle. You just had to go and ruin everything, didn't you?
"
7,1,Stan,"You mean, the thing in Cartman's ass?
"
12,12,Randy,"Uhh...  Oh ow.  Hey, where are my pants?  Where's our TV?! Where are my pants and where's my TV?!
"
8,11,Butters,"Whoa...  I'm feeling kind of bowling-ballish, fellas.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
3,12,Kyle,"Alright, alright, let's get this over with so we can put her back!
"
13,3,Stan,"It does?
"
9,13,Kyle,"I went up to Jambu's tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did. Jambu swam up and started talking to me about rocket ships! Come on! You gotta check it out! 
"
16,12,Randy,"Okay good, that's... that should that should be good... Shelly.
"
11,9,Randy,"I guess it was pretty big.
"
13,8,Stan,"Dude, I don't understand at all. I eat Chipotle all the time and it never made me crap blood.
"
12,6,Randy,"My Internet's not working; I gotta use yours. An-and give Daddy some private time, will ya?
"
8,5,Butters,"When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he's her! He sings and dances around with a life-sized cutout of Justin Timberlake.
"
9,8,Kyle,"Dude, this whole building is going to collapse!
"
15,9,Butters,"While people play in the sun all day
"
13,13,Cartman,"He stuttered like a bitch! I've got this job in the bag!  Who are you?
"
14,1,Butters,"There! It was like that! It looked just like that!  Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right..
"
4,8,Kyle,"Oh.
"
18,7,Stan,"Poor Butters. Can't you just leave him alone?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Let's all try to help a little, 'cause 
"
7,8,Randy,"Oh really?!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Wow, I've never thought of it that way before, but you're right.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, kids? Uh, you shouldn't do drugs, m'kay? Drugs are bad. You see, I was at the bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck; why, I didn't even care about money. I was-I was wasting my life... 
"
15,7,Randy,"I don't know if I've changed or you have. I just feel like I might not have a whole lot of time left and... I want to enjoy it.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Whoa. What was that?
"
7,7,Stan,"You totally had it! You had enough to save the town and then some.
"
8,6,Kyle,"Hey Look! 
"
14,8,Stan,"Why not?
"
15,1,Cartman,"You know, Mom, the least you could do is kiss me first. 'Cause I liked to be kissed before I get fucked!
"
1,4,Stan,"I'm not playing in that stupid game. I have to find my dog. 
"
9,9,Cartman,"No, not like Juwanna Mann, Kevin, okay? It's way cooler than that!
"
7,10,Stan,"But they kill people.
"
4,10,Butters,"He had sins that he didn't confess!
"
14,4,Kyle,"What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?
"
7,11,Cartman,"The cannibal! The cannibal's dead, Butters! But he bit me,  which means soon I will have a taste for human flesh as well.
"
15,14,Cartman,"Heh heh, yeah?
"
16,6,Cartman,"You... You killed Kenny! 
"
13,9,Butters,"Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.
"
8,4,Butters,"I let those people down! Don't you get it, man?! Eight people died!
"
5,11,Kyle,"Alright then, hu-how do I catch it?
"
16,6,Kyle,"It was like having the life sucked out of you. That' all it is, sliding down a cable. Maybe without a tour group it'd be ...kind of fun. Maybe. But, this was just... a complete disaster.
"
4,10,Mr. Mackey,"God is in the midst of her, m'kay. She shall not be moved, m'kay.  Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, m'kay, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof, m'kay. There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place- 
"
13,12,Stan,"Now, we have some ideas, and we'd love to hear your ideas, and I think together we can-  ...and I think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all.
"
2,10,Stan,"Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!
"
2,11,Stan,"Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?
"
3,3,Stan,"You forgot!
"
1,5,Kyle,"Yeah Stan, she's just a girl.
"
12,2,Kyle,"Aw come on now, people! 
"
12,10,Kenny,"('Cause girls like shaved balls.)
"
10,12,Butters,"Go where?
"
8,6,Kyle,"Come on!
"
16,5,Stan,"Aw Butters, you ruined it. This is all one big long shot and you ruined it.
"
6,1,Butters,"Ugh.  Wuh, wuh, I can't eat no more.
"
18,7,Butters,"When we were playing with the Oculus headset. Wuh don't you guys remember?  We were all messin' around with it. I played with it first, and, and went a little nuts. Uh I forgot I was in virtual reality and I got grounded, and now I'm grounded in real life.
"
3,13,Stan,"Nice speech, nerdo.
"
10,3,Randy,"FAMILY GUY!!!  I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!
"
7,13,Kyle,"But... isn't that, kind of, lying?
"
8,11,Stan,"All right, Sexy Action School News Team, it's time to go to work. Get out there and get some stories!
"
9,2,Stan,"Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, can I have your attention please? What are we doing?  It's been nine days! Doesn't it seem like we should accomplish something?
"
2,9,Wendy,"Hrmph!
"
3,1,Kyle,"Miss Stevens, you have a bug on your back.
"
16,8,Cartman,"Hm, it's kind of a grapey, bleachy flavor.
"
3,14,Kyle,"You cheated, Cartman!
"
4,2,Stan,"Dude, just stop thinking about it.
"
5,2,Stan,"See ya, Dad!
"
11,11,Kyle,"No, no dude, it went up there.
"
10,8,Stan,"We can't do this without you now! Come on! 
"
11,13,Butters,"Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! 
"
17,1,Cartman,"No! Dude, I'm gonna sneak into their headquarters disguised as an employee, and I'm gonna-  Hey, hang on a second, Lawrence.  I think we have a Nosey Nancy in the room.  Dude, my Twitter account might already be compromised. If I'm gonna infiltrate the NSA and get all their secrets out to the public, then I'm gonna need something better than Twitter.
"
15,7,Cartman,"Stan's getting another present, Mom.
"
12,8,Cartman,"They are so! There's two billion of them and their economy is getting better and with all their advances in technology they're gonna bring down America.
"
1,12,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, keep quiet. I'm trying to sleep. 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Ugh.  Just remember the song ""Can't Touch This"" and you'll remember the code word!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. Uheheheh, heh.
"
3,15,Stan,"It fell;
"
2,18,Kenny,"(Blue.)
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Yeah! Fuck yeah!  Yeah, I did it! I'm the b-bub-best!  '
"
12,13,Wendy,"No way. That's be stupid. I wouldn't have a chance with Bridon; he can be with any girl he wants. 
"
2,17,Stan,"No.
"
8,12,Butters,"HAAAAH! 
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey, look at what the postman brought me! It's a big brown package from Afghanistan!
"
3,16,Cartman,"Well, because yesterday I got my period. 
"
9,12,Randy,"Look, we don't want our son to join your group, okay?
"
1,6,Stan,"Grampa!
"
8,8,Butters,"Yeah, game on, Jew-boy! 
"
2,10,Cartman,"Where is the Nintendo?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Are you talkin' to me?!
"
1,7,Wendy,"I'm sorry I dissed you at school like that Stan. I guess I just wasn't very considerate of your feelings.
"
16,12,Kyle,"Does anybody even go to Blockbuster anymore?
"
5,5,Stan,"Okay. Okay, I think we lost them.
"
6,14,Stan,"Jesus... we have to get out of here. 
"
7,13,Cartman,"We're sorry.
"
6,2,Stan,"Dude, what the hell is your problem?!
"
4,2,Cartman,"How can I trust you?  How can I trust anyone ever again, Mother? I guess, uh to make it through this life, I can only trust myself.  Myself and Willikins Bear, of course.
"
10,9,Kyle,"Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?
"
2,18,Kyle,"Oh. Okay, it's over this way 
"
1,2,Cartman,"Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like, ""Hey, get out of my ass you stupid rainbows!"" 
"
3,16,Cartman,"Oh, look. It's that little boy who hasn't gotten his period yet.
"
12,13,Kyle,"Do what you want, don't have restraint.
"
4,6,Cartman,"You can't go.
"
4,9,Cartman,"No way!
"
16,4,Kyle,"It doesn't matter. Because God is going to harden the Pharaoh's heart!
"
3,3,Kyle,"I can't believe it!
"
12,14,Butters,"Vampires. I've seen them.
"
13,1,Cartman,"The hell did you do to us?!
"
10,3,Stan,"Sso?
"
7,6,Stan,"Aw crap!
"
6,10,Wendy,"Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs.
"
4,4,Stan,"Oh dear. Timmy's band broke up?
"
2,15,Cartman,"Why the hell not?!
"
5,3,Kyle,"It's just me.
"
14,4,Stan,"'Scuse me, my name is-
"
3,2,Randy,"Boyfriend. And they said Kenny had a new girlfriend.
"
2,16,Cartman,"How the hell did Mr. Hankey get so popular? Look at all this Mr. Hankey stuff. 
"
1,2,Kyle,"Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play. 
"
10,3,Wendy,"...yeah.
"
1,4,Stan,"Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don't-  Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!  No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi. 
"
16,3,Kyle,"Copy that. 10 seconds, Cartman.
"
17,1,Butters,"We've got a new member today! Eric Cartman, do you love your country?!
"
3,15,Stan,"Let me try. 
I'll try to make it spin.
It fell; I'll try again.
"
11,11,Butters,"Wait! Waaait! 
"
1,7,Kyle,"Well at least my mom's not on the cover of Crack Whore magazine!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-
"
17,7,Jimmy,"Come on, Sir Stan. There must be kids somewhere who will join us. 
"
13,10,Kyle,"Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!
"
8,11,Cartman,"Oooo, interview with the vice-President, hmmm. Frankly, Jimmy, I don't know how we're gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and Who's got Skidmarks Monday.
"
13,8,Cartman,"Billy Mays? Billy Mays?!  Dude, you didn't tell us Ike was seeing Billy Mays!
"
3,5,Cartman,"What the?
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmuh! 
"
15,5,Kyle,"What's going on?!
"
18,6,Randy,"Can you believe him?! He knew how much he was spending! He knew he'd get in trouble, but it didn't matter!  I hate to say it, but this is a lot like his grandpa.
"
10,6,Stan,"Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!
"
11,4,Cartman,"Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
"
13,12,Stan,"Clyde, can you take care of getting KFC for Cartman? Kyle and I will get the spray paint cans. If we do this right, we'll be doing the town a huge favor, so let's get to it!
"
8,5,Butters,"Hang on a second, here! 
"
14,9,Randy,"Fuck New Jersey!  Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!
"
3,10,Cartman,"It's all Chinpokomon now.
"
11,5,Randy,"...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.
"
3,12,Kenny,"(You guys, I'm gonna try and win that costume contest!)
"
4,8,Wendy,"Cartman, we can't just attack Stan and Kyle's credibility. We need to present our side of the debate.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Mel! Gibson!  Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You're actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses! We are ready to do thy bidding!  Have I been a good boy, Mr. Gibson?!
"
1,5,Cartman,"UUuuhh.  I sure am hungry.
"
8,1,Kyle,"So I guess this means we get to keep our weapons.
"
17,6,Cartman,"Yeah, be sure to show everyone, guys. It's really amazing. Heheh, too good, too too good.
"
1,6,Stan,"Yeah, but, mom!
"
10,2,Randy,"Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.
"
1,4,Kyle,"Wow, it's been like two days.
"
6,12,Randy,"Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor.
"
3,13,Kyle,"...Uuh, can I talk to her?
"
9,5,Kyle,"You hate this game too?
"
2,12,Kyle,"What? Why?
"
8,11,Cartman,"All right, so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria, we're go to Kyle for the story on Brian Teeves trying to make out with Susan Farkle.
"
17,1,Kyle,"How do we have a choice?!
"
8,6,Stan,"You don't have to tell us twice, Mom. That guy's a freak!
"
3,3,Stan,"There she is! 
"
4,17,Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, not this thing again.
"
8,11,Stan,"Craig's new show?
"
8,1,Stan,"Butters!
"
6,16,Stan,"Dude, how long has your future self been around?
"
14,4,Stan,"Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!
"
16,5,Kyle,"Excuse me, what are you doing to my locker?!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Because  of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
"
4,14,Cartman,"I can't dude. Timmy has a boner for it.
"
2,11,Kyle,"But it's true, dude!
"
12,11,Randy,"Nothing, sorry. I just startled myself. Gaaah! 
"
14,10,Stan,"Aw come on.
"
4,9,Randy,"And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?! 
"
1,8,Cartman,"When they cut up a chick's stomach to get a baby out?
"
4,15,Kyle,"Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?
"
12,13,Stan,"But... No, we just... No, no wait. We just got good at this! Aw!.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Nothing. Um , my period is really uuuh...  Uuuh, my period is going swimmingly.
"
9,3,Stan,"Ohhhh Token. Right, yeah, you're makin' a smart move, man.
"
13,6,Randy,"So, so guess what? Our Pinewood Derby car found alien life in space.
"
13,14,Stan,"Come on, dude!
"
11,14,Cartman,"Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about.
"
3,6,Cartman,"Oh, you did it again! You all heard him!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Dude. Come on, now. Come on.
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Well children, I am your teacher. I think you'll find that my advice is just as valuable as Chef's, if not more so.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Well there's still time before Christmas! Can't I still make up for it?
"
1,3,Cartman,"What do you mean? Have you ever seen Step By Step?  So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts. They say that on quiet nights you can hear him weaving his baskets. Tahink … tahink … tahink.
"
17,8,Kenny,"(Welcome to my kingdom, Sir Eric. Now, state your purpose.)
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"All we were tryin' to do was keep another one of our students from killing themselves! We're not bad!
"
6,11,Stan,"Bi ologad bag, big nan dastai. 
"
2,13,Kyle,"No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
"
7,10,Randy,"The boys, Gerald! Where are they?!
"
16,11,Butters,"They won't let me on the plane. Why, I can't do anything right!  No, no! I have to go to Hawaii, Kenny! I have no idea what's waiting there for me, but I guh, I can't go on like this! 
"
17,1,Butters,"Hello, Craig. How would you like to know the Truth?
"
6,2,Cartman,"You guys, you guys! You're not gonna believe this, this is so funny!
"
18,4,Randy,"I know! Are we watching at your house?!
"
2,8,Stan,"I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt.
"
18,2,Randy,"Beer. I didn't know it had gluten.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Is a meme I will fight
'Cause I'm Faith Hilling 'til the day that I die.
"
1,6,Stan,"Ok, here we go. Bye grampa, it was nice knowing you.
"
6,14,Kyle,"Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Uh, what's the question again?
"
1,10,Mr. Garrison,"Children, children! Today is a very special day.
"
17,8,Cartman,"Kenny, we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while, 'kay? But you are never going to be a real princess!
"
13,7,Cartman,"That we be, lass. It's all paid for on me mudder's credit card.
"
3,2,Stan,"Huh?
"
8,9,Kyle,"Hey! Isn't there where Stark's Pond used to be? Where we used to kayak and fish?
"
10,13,Butters,"Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?
"
10,3,Kyle,"I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.
"
7,5,Kyle,"No!
"
2,13,Stan,"Oh, hell!
"
8,4,Cartman,"All right!
"
17,6,Kyle,"Mom?
"
6,7,Kyle,"Hey! Let's pour them in the teacher's coffee tomorrow morning.
"
7,12,Mr. Garrison,"Gary was state champion in wrestling AND in tennis.  He also maintained a 4.0 grade point average at his old school AND has been on two national commercials for toothpaste.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Fine.
"
3,4,Cartman,"I don't think that's very fair: if I teach Craig, he's gonna really kill Tweek.
"
6,1,Stan,"Now, he's got lots of moneys and girls
"
17,6,Cartman,"Cheer up, Kyle. I'm sure this isn't the first time someone who thought they were suffering for humanity was actually just sucking farts. Hey. How about we get a little dessert, help cheer you up? 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Now let's see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, 'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.
"
15,1,Kyle,"You see? And then I can take all my homework on my iPad, and swipe it over to my iPhone.
"
17,7,Randy,"No! 
"
8,9,Randy,"Those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers! They were three dollars five minutes ago! The Wall-Mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us!
"
16,4,Kyle,"If someone says they saw a Sasquatch, they are either lying or they are stupid. Now stop lying about a Jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you!
"
2,14,Stan,"No, you don't!
"
4,11,Timmy,"Timmilih? 
"
2,18,Cartman,"Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles! 
"
12,2,Randy,"For harvest, Stanley. Same reason we've always done it.
"
7,9,Kyle,"Just get the hell out of here, Cartman! You're not serious and you're a detriment to the band!
"
1,5,Cartman,"Oh yeah, watch me. 
"
16,12,Randy,"Yeah...
"
11,4,Cartman,"Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
"
3,17,Stan,"Yeah, but you know? I learned something today. We were so worried about how cool we looked to those New Yorker kids that we forgot: we're already totally cool, even if we don't know what queef means. 
"
7,4,Kyle,"Cartman? Cartman saved the day?
"
2,6,Cartman,"Ee-goddammit!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?
"
5,4,Cartman,"I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.
I'm a little piggy; here's
- Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!
"
15,4,Stan,"Wait, it says mine's only 2.1 inches. That doesn't seem right.
"
7,12,Randy,"Well, no, no, I just-
"
3,10,Cartman,"Oh, you didn't get a special Chinpokomon game controller. T-heh heh heh heh. Jehesus C-hrist! 
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"Hello, children. Ready for lunch?
"
8,14,Stan,"I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? 
"
6,4,Butters,"""Susanne Sommers' Calf Exerciser.""
"
3,2,Kyle,"Hey, that went really well. They really liked it.
"
5,3,Stan,"No, I'm Stan.
"
11,1,Stan,"Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Right uh-  Wha- ...what was that?
"
1,11,Cartman,"That is so-ho lame!  Oh man, I...
"
2,14,Kyle,"But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
"
8,1,Kyle,"Goddammit Cartman, stop throwin' those stupid poppy-things at me! 
"
5,7,Butters,"...Pretty good.
"
17,7,Butters,"Woo, spooky.
"
3,12,Cartman,"That's right, and that means only two more months till Christmas! You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry—
"
2,7,Cartman,"Ma? I just dreamt that me and Stan and Kyle and Kenny were trapped on our bus, and we were talking about everything that happened to us, except that it was all wrong and everything ended with us eating ice cream.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Yeah. 
"
8,11,Cartman,"And now, for a look at the weather, here is Token Black, and Token, I hope there's no tornadoes headed our way.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Aw dude, I hate repeats!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Buh... but... this doesn't make sense!  How can gay men do this to their own people??  Unless... you're not gay at all... 
"
2,11,Cartman,"Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!  Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!  You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!  Planetariums suck ass! 
"
10,6,Cartman,"That's right, and I...  Fake treasure?
"
7,6,Kyle,"Because, dude, we're playing detectives! Detectives don't just go tell on people.
"
15,12,Stan,"Because of you! It's your fault that we have to do this! We have to do this because you're unhealthy!
"
1,3,Cartman,"Holy crap! 
"
10,11,Randy,"Biggie Smalls?
"
6,7,Cartman,"No, just a bunch of goo.
"
2,15,Stan,"Up yours, evil twin! 
"
3,3,Kyle,"Moving in?!
"
11,7,Kyle,"You barely made it over one, fatass!
"
8,13,Kyle,"Don't listen to 'em, Cartman! I'm sure it'll work. Go for it. Yaaay, Cartman! Fly, fly, fly!
"
5,10,Butters,"Ahah-I can't, fellas. Ah-I'm grounded for lookin' stupid in my school picture.
"
13,11,Stan,"I thought you guys were pirates in a war!
"
10,8,Kenny,"(Woohoo! Oh man!)
"
3,10,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
1,1,Stan,"Sorry, dude. I gotta go meet Wendy Testaburger.
"
7,6,Kyle,"That's great, Butters, but we're not playing Detective anymore. We're playing laundromat owners.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book! Face it, you're a lackey, Mackey!
"
14,2,Butters,"Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!
"
2,9,Stan,"Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?
"
6,11,Stan,"I hope this movie doesn't suck ass.
"
1,6,Cartman,"My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.
"
6,12,Randy,"Well, our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend Kenny again and... and that he thought it would work...  if he... built the ladder to heaven.
"
17,7,Butters,"Well it's it's pretty good, I guess, but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guy's wiener, that guy's character is gay?
"
11,5,Stan,"Grandpa's in it too?
"
18,2,Cartman,"Dude, people are pissed off at us.
"
5,11,Kyle,"What's he look like?
"
9,3,Kyle,"Cartman! 
"
18,10,Kyle,"Come out here and talk to me face to face! Open this door!
"
4,1,Cartman,"What? A federal offense?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Gotcha! 
"
9,8,Stan,"Ohhh, fuck it!
"
10,14,Stan,"Okay. 
"
2,15,Stan,"Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. 
"
16,6,Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
"
4,10,Kyle,"Mom! Dad! Am I gong to hell?
"
9,6,Cartman,"Butters! Butters, I just want to talk to you!
"
8,9,Kyle,"You said we have no idea that you're never let us hurt Wall-Mart!
"
11,1,Randy,"Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh...  Let's see here uh...
"
16,14,Kenny,"(At Red Lobster.)
"
3,2,Randy,"Exactly. 
"
14,6,Cartman,"Nice work, Conner.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"But you were just there! Why do you wanna go again so soon?
"
1,13,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, Okay! I admit it! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance! But who here didn't?!  Now come on, honestly. Who here has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman? 
"
5,11,Kyle,"Uha, wa, actually, I- I can't eat beef. I have a degenerative problem with my intestinal lining, and beef really gives me gaass.
"
13,2,Cartman,"Which one of them is it? Somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero! But who? Has to be one of the guys in my class, 'cause only they knew that the Coon would be on the rooftop of Walgreens.  No, stop. Can't think about that right now. Have to focus.  Tomorrow is the most important day in the Coon's life. Everything the Coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow. Concentrate.
"
3,3,Cartman,"My eyes are going bad, but the only eye doctor in South Park is really, really mean.
"
8,4,Kyle,"Sweet. I made mine go off the jump. 
"
13,8,Cartman,"Ohh well how nice for you, Stan. It's great you've got a golden rectum of the gods, but the rest of us need Chipotlaway.
"
11,5,Randy,"I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!
"
5,1,Kyle,"And asshole.
"
5,3,Kyle,"Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could stick my penis in your vagina?
"
13,7,Cartman,"Then why don't you wanna go?
"
15,8,Kyle,"Yeah.  Hey Riley! Try this hamburger.  Cartman made them himself.
"
4,2,Cartman,"Wow, look at the size of these houses!
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Wokay, in fifteen fucking minutes you all are not gonna care about this anymore, so I'll just say what I need to say. That was the worst rehearsal we have ever had! We are two days away from opening and you're all fuckin' around!
"
11,7,Kyle,"Really?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Please, just, just leave it alone, Stan. Everything is as it has to be.
"
7,6,Butters,"...ow... Ow!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Ughuh...  Drinkin's bad.
"
10,3,Randy,"Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet.
"
3,2,Stan,"Yeah.
"
1,11,Kyle,"Yup!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Mexico here we come! 
"
6,10,Cartman,"Put the lotion in the fucking basket!  Oh no! Precious!  I've got your dog, Mister. Let me out or I'm gonna kill it!  Now you say, ""Don't you hurt my fuckin' dog!""
"
16,4,Kyle,"What are you doing?
"
8,3,Cartman,"Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
11,5,Stan,"Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?
"
4,10,Cartman,"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
"
3,13,Cartman,"Home-schooled kids? Who the hell are they?
"
1,13,Stan,"What?? 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Well, why did you pull it out of the trash?
"
5,13,Stan,"Well that burned a long time.
"
2,12,Randy,"I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry.
"
6,12,Cartman,"I don't know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic  and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box.  I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken-  AY! 
"
12,8,Stan,"No! Uh what are you gonna do to him?! 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Oh no! The tape jammed! 
"
12,13,Stan,"But the girls like singing and dancing.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They're liars and cheats.
"
15,1,Kyle,"You guys!  You gotta help me. These business casual G-men are trying to kidnap me!
"
1,8,Kyle,"Ah, I told you we shouldn't have brought him to school dude.
"
5,10,Kyle,"It isn't that funny, Cartman.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Hey, is your show as good as America Idol?
"
9,5,Cartman,"Wiat. I've got it, you guys. A fifth point in a sports movie, the team always goes out and finds a really sweet player to join their team.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Wendy. Wendy psst.
"
12,10,Randy,"What the hell was that? 
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Sit down, boys. Now, let's see. What did Mr. Garrison send you in here for? ""The boys were being rude while a choir teacher was giving some stupid presentation-""
"
18,7,Cartman,"I know. Let's go to the backyard. 
"
13,13,Kyle,"""These, are the morning announcements."" 
"
14,2,Kyle,"Oh that's,  yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one...
"
2,15,Stan,"The fish!  But-.
"
8,1,Kyle,"No asshole! From now on you only get to have one power! So what is it?!
"
3,17,Kyle,"Mung's good.
"
9,6,Jimmy,"Hey fellas, w-where is Cartman? 
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Right, Jimmy Valmer.
"
3,12,Cartman,"Nno Grandma.
"
1,11,Kyle,"Ms. Ellen, dude! She's beautiful! 
"
18,6,Jimmy,"I needed the money, alright?!  I downloaded Yum Yum Sparkly Gem Forest because it was free. I love the sparkly little gems. The sounds they made when I got new ones. Then I made my first in-app purchase. Before I knew it I had spent my allowance, then my birthday money, I LOST my CRUTCHES!
"
9,12,Randy,"Stan! What the hell did you do?!
"
7,6,Kyle,"Well, we've all talked it through and we've come up with a theory.
"
7,12,Stan,"No, I was supposed to be home at eight.
"
18,7,Butters,"Aghah. Okay, stop! Stooop!
"
7,11,Cartman,"We've got to fight them off!  Stay away from Butters! He's humanity's last hope!  Awww! He bit me! He bit off my hand!!
"
18,1,Cartman,"I just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch. 
"
7,11,Butters,"Wuh, wait, well, what happened??
"
7,8,Kyle,"I'm just trying to fit in, Daddy. Don't be such a drama queen! 
"
6,8,Randy,"Great news, Stan! The Vatican is burning down!
"
16,2,Stan,"Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
"
15,5,Kyle,"But who paid for all this? 
"
17,10,Wendy,"...Nooo.
"
12,10,Stan,"Jesus Christ!
"
2,14,Stan,"Yeah, thanks.  That’s $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!
"
1,13,Cartman,"I... am... so... pissed... off... right... now.
"
11,5,Randy,"You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!
"
2,15,Cartman,"'Cause I'm hella cool, that's why.
"
6,15,Kyle,"Yeah, and, we don't know whether or not we should care.
"
1,9,Kyle,"Come on, dance!  Daaance!  Dance, damn you!!
"
4,7,Stan,"Don't be a smartass?
"
4,16,Cartman,"Snow igloos kick ass. 
"
7,7,Randy,"Listen, Stan. SARS is destroying our people. The Native Americans put it in the blankets they gave us.  Soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left. 
"
7,8,Cartman,"Have you guys seen this? It's a conditioner that you can leave in, and it detoxifies the scalp.
"
14,11,Randy,"It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Hahahaha haa ha!
"
4,12,Stan,"Less than 20 minutes?!
"
11,8,Kyle,"...Scotch?
"
12,8,Cartman,"They're gonna... take over the world! HAA!  Too many of them.  No! Leave us alone!  Nooo!  Damn it no! No!
"
6,1,Cartman,"No, I totally covered for you. They completely believed I was you on the phone!
"
8,3,Stan,"Okay, search for Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson bio, Mel Gibson news, Mel Gibson... home page. Here we go.  Welcome to Mel Gibson's ThePassion.com, your source for everything Mel. Pictures, philosophy, upcoming projects. Damn it, no phone number! Oh wait! ""For more information on Mel Gibson, call the Webmaster at 1-800-43.."" Okay, okay, wait, here we go. 
"
11,14,Stan,"That didn't sparkle with her, did it?
"
6,13,Cartman,"Clyde's a dick.
"
8,11,Kyle,"So where are students getting all this cough medicine??  This surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist!  Sexy Action School News reported the pharmacist to the South Park police, and he was immediately arrested! 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Wah!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Dad?  Pop, I'm just fast asleep—I'm not hearing anything. 
"
4,13,Kyle,"I can't reach the CPU.
"
18,2,Stan,"We can't let our party suck.
"
8,3,Stan,"Look, kid, we just thought it was a bad movie, so tell us how to get in touch with Mel Gibson so we can get our money back!
"
2,17,Stan,"Our case?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha! 
"
4,14,Kyle,"We can't be outdone by the kindergartners!
"
8,5,Cartman,"The fuck are you talkin' about, dude?!
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uhhh, well, I'm not sure.
"
4,14,Stan,"'Ere 'ere, my good wife, 'ere is nothing we can do.
"
7,12,Randy,"And?  Your turn, Sharon.
"
4,1,Kyle,"And we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?
"
6,5,Kyle,"God-dammit. Come on, guys. We gotta go to Butters' house.
"
3,15,Cartman,"...play stupid games.
"
6,12,Stan,"Where??
"
2,17,Kyle,"Sure. 
"
14,2,Stan,"You can't be serious! You people like this?!
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ex-cuse me?! If my little brother has been getting some athlete's hormones, then who has been getting Ike's medication?!
"
11,12,Stan,"Kyle? Kyle, what happened?
"
1,8,Cartman,"KICK ASS!!
"
1,2,Wendy,"Hitler was famous too.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse?! 
"
6,13,Kyle,"Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
"
18,6,Kyle,"You need to stop recommending that app to people!
"
7,13,Randy,"Wha- what the hell is wrong with you? That's not right.
"
8,11,Cartman,"We have crab people. Just sayin'.
"
12,2,Kyle,"What is going on?! Why do you want Britney Spears to die?!
"
7,14,Stan,"What about Wendy? Isn't she still with Token?
"
14,10,Cartman,"So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. 
"
6,10,Stan,"Friend. Ahta.
"
2,16,Kyle,"This is not Mr. Hankey!  This is a fake! 
"
15,4,Randy,"No dude, fuck you! We're burnin' this shit!
"
6,9,Kyle,"It's not too late to do what's right. Give us the print. There's still some good in you, Mr. Lucas. We know there is. 
"
5,1,Kyle,"How many ways are there to take it?! It's just a stupid word!
"
14,4,Stan,"My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
"
17,1,Cartman,"Okay, well put Toby back on the phone! You guys start Googling everyone the directions to the rally site. Toby, are you there, bro?
"
18,5,Cartman,"Check it out guys, she's taking o- Oh my God, we've got full bush!
"
18,5,Butters,"What?! You said nobody would know!
"
3,2,Randy,"Exactly.
"
3,2,Cartman,"Yes she is! I've been hearing her all day! Listen! Listen.  Eric? Eric, where are you? I miss you very much.
"
4,8,Kyle,"W-we really didn't see it that way.
"
2,10,Randy,"We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.
"
3,2,Kyle,"...Oh, yeah. Sorry.
"
17,7,Kyle,"This isn't helping us, Butters!
"
3,4,Kyle,"This is when you gotta get mean, Tweek.
"
18,5,Cartman,"What does that have to do with me?
"
7,7,Kyle,"I said I wanna leave.
"
15,4,Stan,"No, dude, that's not Skeletor, that's Terminator's wife.
"
2,6,Kenny,"(Nononono-yikes!) 
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"And I can't sleep or think...  Where would he have gone? Why would he leave?
"
3,13,Butters,"Hey, isn't that the home-schooled kid's sister? 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Kyle's brother?
"
10,10,Cartman,"Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass.
"
3,2,Randy,"Not me. I'm not a scientist, I'm a hack. Even if I found a solution, those people would still all hate me.
"
16,12,Kyle,"And then we ran out of the Kum & Go and these guys, th-they took our friend.
"
7,4,Randy,"The Founding Fathers would agree with our right to protest!
"
1,13,Kyle,"Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.
"
16,14,Cartman,"I can get those at K-Mart! If you want me to switch sides, you'll have to do better than that!
"
7,8,Stan,"These guys are trying to say they're gayer than us!
"
7,6,Butters,"I'm not playing. I really don't know!
"
4,10,Butters,"Eyou guys! Eyou guys! Uh we just thought of somethin'!
"
14,8,Butters,"Yep. You don't have a penny left.  You're poor as shit.  How come you're hangin' upside down?
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence's butthole didn't take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I'm willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it's the last time! Okay?!
"
14,3,Randy,"Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?
"
7,11,Cartman,"I'm not sure of anything anymore.  Now Butters, listen: No matter what happens, no matter what you hear, do not come out! If I don't make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.
"
5,1,Kyle,"I don't really give a fuck! 
"
2,4,Cartman,"No way, I set up mine first, hippie!
"
6,1,Butters,"No- but you don't sound like me.
"
18,5,Butters,"Loo looloo loo loo loo loo, Loo looloo loo loo.
"
7,9,Stan,"See? Everyone on the Internet copies their music from their CDs, and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer!
"
7,15,Cartman,"It's Christmas. We officially missed it. It's Christmas Day and ... I'm in Canada.
"
16,3,Stan,"Alright, go Cartman.
"
3,10,Kyle,"No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Hey! Who was that?! Who came to the door?!
"
9,12,Stan,"I am?? I didn't know that!
"
6,10,Cartman,"Bark bark bark.  Okay, so then we put my mom's hand lotion in this little basket  and lower it down to Polly Prissy Pants. 
"
7,4,Cartman,"The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.
"
4,3,Stan,"They have nowhere else to go.  Please?
"
10,6,Kenny,"(We're almost there!)
"
2,15,Cartman,"Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!
"
13,13,Cartman,"You wanted to see me again, Principal Victoria?
"
14,5,Cartman,"AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!
"
8,10,Butters,"No, Trent, I-I ain't gonna run. We can talk this through.
"
10,4,Kyle,"Cartman!!  You fucking fatass!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Jeh
"
13,9,Butters,"All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!
"
8,13,Cartman,"...Jeez, this looks a lot higher from up here.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmmeh!
"
2,15,Cartman,"Don't touch me! 
"
7,4,Cartman,"If you all don't mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"We get a bus... and then we... throw Eric Cartman under it.
"
18,7,Butters,"I'm taking your money! Ow. Oh she stabbed me. Uh the hooker stabbed me.
"
12,14,Butters,"Maybe not.  Did you say you're trying to get rid of the vampires?  I want to help you.
"
4,6,Stan,"Um, deny it?
"
5,5,Stan,"Oh my God!
"
2,17,Kenny,"(Let me try! Let me try!)
"
9,5,Randy,"Attaway, South Park! They ain't swingin' at nothin'!
"
4,15,Cartman,"Memememeee! 
"
8,11,Kyle,"Jesus, you may be right.
"
6,10,Cartman,"Alright guys, now that we're all here, I think... we need to have a difficult conversation. It's obvious that Bebe is the like the coolest, smartest, most awesome person we've ever met.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Motherfucker!
"
1,1,Stan,"I think we have to signal them somehow.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Uh, I think we're gonna try your authentic pizzareli casserona poppers.
"
1,8,Stan,"Oh.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Amen.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Oh.)
"
7,11,Cartman,"Believe me, Butters, you don't wanna see what's up there. Now come on. I'll guide you to a safer location. &lt;/&gt; There you go. Two more steps and you're at the top.  Good.
"
8,14,Stan,"What?!
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time? I was just a middleman.  People were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me. I'm not the one who made it.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Shunkarah puntaur lah-turi.
"
6,12,Randy,"When you die, your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until you're nothing but ashes. 
"
3,12,Stan,"This one time, like eight months ago, I saw two guys kissing in a park. And that was the gayest thing I'd ever seen, until I saw the KOZY-FM Halloween Haunt. 
"
3,13,Butters,"Got it. 
"
7,15,Kenny,"(Gah!)
"
16,8,Randy,"Yes Stan, this is what people want! Don't worry, you look really cool. 
"
3,6,Stan,"Where's our desks?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Oh, nothing, except that you stick it up your ass before you go to bed.
"
18,2,Jimmy,"No food at a party? And I thought I was handicapped! 
"
9,3,Stan,"All right, our client will do it!
"
7,15,Cartman,"Of course I care about Christmas- Doh, Christ on a stick! 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Now boys, you need to listen up, m'kay? Wha-what I'm talkin' about might save your life someday, m'kay?
"
1,5,Kyle,"Yeah, but that sucks, to get your butt kicked by a girl, Stan.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Driiive! You've gotta driiive! Nooow!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Uhm, I'll take one of those.)
"
3,16,Mr. Mackey,"Only one?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Please, I wasn't starting rumors about you. I don't even know who you are.
"
3,15,Kyle,"We're singing about a dreidel.
"
3,17,Cartman,"Lowest Eb, let's see. I think it looks like this. 
"
2,5,Kyle,"No. No, it'll be okay!
"
10,11,Stan,"If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I know who he is! But why is everyone ditching my comedy show to see him?!
"
10,12,Stan,"Dude you don't look so good, Cartman.
"
8,11,Cartman,"Fuck off, Whistlin' Willy. We're not in the mood.
"
6,1,Stan,"Dude, that isn't cool. You shouldn't joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn't passed.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Wuh w-what?!
"
8,1,Butters,"Yeah Mom, I'm just goin' outside for a little while.
"
17,2,Stan,"Goddammit, I just don't want my parents to murder each other!  Can't you see that all we're trying to do is keep our families safe? Look, ah I don't know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it, and we probably won't be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch. All we're trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them. Because cable makes is so convenient. Sure, if they didn't have easy access to their murder porn channels, they'd be bummed out, but it's not just our responsibility to give them what they want. Is it?
"
14,10,Stan,"Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
"
10,3,Cartman,"Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, ""Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?"" ""Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman.""  I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!
"
1,3,Cartman,"Dude, that's sick mom.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Whatup, Mazie? Ye-yo, Pops?
"
14,7,Jimmy,"Alright blue team. As team captain, I need to make sure we are ready for the big camp competition.
"
13,9,Stan,"Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!
"
3,14,Randy,"Huh?
"
4,16,Butters,"Uhh rrreeally are you sure?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Butters.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Uh yeah, sorry, I live here, I just, I can't remember the code to turn off the alarm!
"
9,9,Butters,"Hello?
"
15,10,Cartman,"He crapped his pants today during social studies! He had to go to the nurse's office, and have his mom bring him a fresh pair of jeans! 
"
16,13,Stan,"And it grows and it grows, right in your balls, until they have to cut it out!
"
6,4,Randy,"What is that?
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmih! '
"
6,9,Stan,"Fuck you, Steven Spielberg! Come on, you guys! 
"
18,9,Randy,"Yes, Freemium gaming.
"
6,12,Cartman,"You'd better not lose that ticket, Kenny, or else I'll kick you in the nuts! The nuts! The nuts!"
13,12,Cartman,"What?
"
1,10,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
"
15,14,Kyle,"I hear your parents might give up selling meth for good.
"
11,2,Cartman,"...Shit, I gotta find Butters! 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"…and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet?  No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD.  Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney…
"
6,4,Stan,"We won't have to. Butters said he has something in his house that makes baby cows strong again. He's bringing it over.
"
5,7,Stan,"Don't look at Butters' schlong, gaymo!
"
3,12,Cartman,"Spooky spider?
"
13,10,Stan,"Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight.
"
17,5,Cartman,"That's not a crane, it's a dick and balls.
"
4,10,Stan,"And thennn there was the time we held that little first-grader down and farted on him for 28 minutes.
"
9,2,Cartman,"You let them out?! Jesus, we have to find them!
"
3,15,Kyle,"Oh, Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
7,6,Stan,"Just the news.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, seriously, I have to go. Can I please be excused from class?
"
7,7,Kyle,"What the hell are they doing??
"
3,9,Kenny,"(What's that?)
"
1,11,Cartman,"I'm gonna buy a vacuum cleaner-chicks like vacuum cleaners 
"
2,7,Kyle,"Dude! He got Brent Musberger for a leg!
"
1,13,Kyle,"Dad, how could you?!
"
10,8,Randy,"Nn-Oh my God! 
"
12,11,Randy,"Okay. We're running now.  There's Sharon and Shelly running. Wave to the camera, Shelly!
"
5,3,Kyle,"You're Stan.
"
12,8,Kyle,"They're just taking Indiana Jones and they're...  they're raping him! 
"
1,1,Cartman,"Hi, Mom.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
18,8,Kyle,"But we actually are busy. Tonight's the big fight.
"
2,12,Stan,"Oh, man. 
Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass. I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you. I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.
Whoa, dude!
"
3,4,Cartman,"Well, that's fine. I guess you don't care about what Tweek said about your mom.
"
15,10,Kyle,"Grab him! 
"
16,1,Stan,"So then we can't sue him?
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"""What's Vietnam?"" A question a child might ask, but not a childish question. Heheheheheheheheheh. Children, for the next few days, we'll be learning all about Vietnam. Chances are that somebody in your own lives was affected by this incredible war.
"
15,7,Stan,"Hey guys.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about.
"
13,7,Cartman,"We set course tomorrow! I purchased everyone's ticket online using me mother's credit card!
"
15,2,Butters,"Well yeah, it's okay, but Jay Leno is really losin' it.
"
2,6,Stan,"Wait a second, I don't take drugs! That was a lie!
"
3,8,Randy,"What?! Why the hell would you do that?!
"
11,14,Stan,"Wendy!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Three boys named Stan, Kyle, and Kenny.
"
5,2,Cartman,"Beat it, toots! We've got discrimination work to do! 
"
15,3,Kyle,"Hmmm, yeah.
"
8,7,Randy,"You can't be serious.
"
3,1,Stan,"Choirs suck.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Clyde, Clyde! What have I told you about pissing on the seat? And Clyde's all like ""Ah, okay mom, fuck! Not in front of my friends! 
"
12,12,Randy,"This is the greatest day of our lives! Yes we can!
"
11,9,Randy,"Oooooo.
"
6,13,Stan,"My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
"
3,6,Cartman,"When you're trying to have intercourse with a lady friend, and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind.
"
7,14,Stan,"There's nothing else I can do. She was my whole life.
"
1,6,Kyle,"Good point man.
"
3,13,Cartman,"Country of origin?
"
10,11,Butters,"But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!
"
1,6,Mr. Garrison,"Okay okay, go ahead.  As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment. 
"
4,7,Stan,"Butters, go on!
"
13,11,Kyle,"Dude, they've been doing that for a long time.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski!
"
15,9,Butters,"Hey! You fellas think you can get me across that border?
"
7,4,Randy,"Look, nobody wants to hear a bunch of twangy country music prowar proopaganda!
"
6,5,Butters,"Whre do we go? Where do we go?
"
7,6,Cartman,"You just make the semen come out of your body and put it in this cup!
"
6,3,Butters,"Hey that spirit gum sure is stinky.
"
1,12,Cartman,"Okay, okay. I'll tell where the triangle is. It's inside my shoe. 
"
12,11,Stan,"I know, a-and look. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"Alright, now this is very hard for me to do, you understand. But, in return for you working security, I'll let you ride two rides a day. But only two rides, and only if I'm not on them.
"
12,4,Cartman,"Sweet. I think we're next in line now.
"
1,9,Mr. Mackey,"No!  Get away from me!
"
5,9,Butters,"Uh, hey!  How's it goin', fellas?
"
9,2,Cartman,"You... You what?
"
11,8,Cartman,"No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's  AAAA no, NAAAA!  I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year.  Ah, I need to be going now.
"
9,11,Cartman,"No, he was just telling me about something funny that happened at school yesterday. Um, oh, but anyway, ohhh! Oh wow, I can't believe how great it feels to finally love my fellow man, huh? Isn't this great you guys? We sure have been throgh a lot! But in the end, we all learned it's best to get along.
Hand in hand, we can live together. Ginger or not, we're all the same.
Black or white, brown or red, we shouldn't kill each other, 'cause it's lame. Come on, guys!
Hand in hand, we can live together.
"
9,3,Cartman,"This just goes to show that hard work doesn't pay off! I'm gonna be a homeless drug addict from now on! 
"
9,9,Butters,"Can I just have some Spaghetti-O's?
"
4,9,Randy,"If all your friends jumped off a cliff,  would you do that too?
"
7,8,Kyle,"Chef, I don't feel very metrosexual.
"
16,3,Cartman,"No. NOO!  I won't do it. I won't do it, you hear me! I'm better than this.  And to hell with you, Mr. Kitty. You're a bad kitty! Bad, bad kitty! It's time somebody stood up, and did the right thing. 
"
7,13,Kyle,"No it isn't, you fat turd! Because, I've learned something today. You just hate-  See, I knew it.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Are you propositioning me?
"
10,7,Cartman,"Because you took my Xbox.
"
6,2,Cartman,"I don't smell anything. Do you guys? 
"
4,17,Cartman,"Kyle, I have a full day of watching TV tomorrow. I don't have time to go on a poo hunt right now, okay?
"
16,2,Cartman,"Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5  This is-oh my God, look at this you guys.  This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?
"
4,1,Stan,"Son of a bitch!
"
4,16,Cartman,"Yeah, I saw it on TV. All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.
"
12,6,Stan,"Eight fifty one.
"
7,9,Stan,"Hey dude.
"
14,10,Wendy,"It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker.
"
12,7,Stan,"Wait, you have guns here?
"
6,12,Kyle,"Grandma??
"
13,13,Cartman,"No! No, dude! You don't just take one person's story and then add a couple of things and call it yours!
"
18,8,Cartman,"Holy shit dude! Dude, we forfeit! We forfeit!
"
1,7,Stan,"You call the number Kyle.
"
9,11,Stan,"Kyle. Kyle, wake up.
"
2,9,Stan,"Hey, dude, these are good!
"
9,6,Butters,"So... the ghost was in my head. The whole time.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Quick, Marvin. Get us to Marklar.
"
18,8,Stan,"Shhh!
"
18,5,Jimmy,"Ohhhh nothin'. You just might wanna... hire Tarzan to do some... landscaping work for your mom. 
"
6,10,Butters,"Uhyep.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Okay, you start on defense, amigo. 
"
7,1,Cartman,"What is it, Chef?
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey there, little guy.
"
4,14,Wendy,"She can't see or hear us, John.
"
11,4,Stan,"So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.
"
7,11,Butters,"Ooooh, what happened? What happened?!
"
16,12,Stan,"What? What's he doing?
"
13,2,Cartman,"Oh my God, look everyone, it's the Coon!
"
1,10,Stan,"Heeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?
"
1,4,Cartman,"You guys see me block that defense today, I was kicking ass.
"
9,7,Cartman,"Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she's saying now isn't interesting at all, you say, ""Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.""
"
6,16,Cartman,"I'm running a business, Stan. Are you my eleven o'clock?
"
12,8,Cartman,"No no! You listen to me! I have Chinese attackers here! And Chinese supporters! If I go outside, there are more Chinese ready to take me down! Defending America is all that matters, Mr. President! And I will stop at nothing! You understand that I  What happened?!
"
4,15,Stan,"Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!
"
5,12,Kyle,"Haha!
"
7,10,Cartman,"Old people gone mad!
"
11,2,Butters,"Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... 
"
16,4,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
15,8,Mr. Garrison,"And so children, at noon today, all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations, and boys will head on out to recess. 
"
12,3,Stan,"He apparently got to all the cats Cartman's been hiding in his attic.
"
7,11,Butters,"What's this all about, Eric?
"
18,3,Kyle,"Are you okay, Cartman?
"
7,15,Kyle,"Okay.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Praise God-uh!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Well, I just, I kind of like having you around.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Aw, dude, we've gotta go back to church and confess again.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
"
4,10,Stan,"Oh man, we can't let Timmy go to hell. We have to do something.
"
6,5,Kyle,"But Dad, this is all the never-before-seen footage.
"
10,11,Butters,"Haaaah.
"
1,6,Stan,"We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it.
"
3,8,Randy,"We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay! 
"
6,9,Stan,"You're wrong, Mr. Lucas. They're not your movies. They're ours. All of ours. We paid to go see them, and they're just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to...
"
8,12,Cartman,"Oh, Goddammit!
"
18,1,Stan,"Washington Redskins.  I like it!
"
6,10,Stan,"Hah hah, hah!  Uuuuh-okay. Go ahead, Clyde.
"
17,2,Wendy,"The vast majority of refugees from Syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from-
"
8,14,Stan,"No, he didn't!
"
14,2,Butters,"Thank you! 
"
9,2,Cartman,"Brah, I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? Just go with it.
"
17,6,Cartman,"Well I just ran to the school and told everyone, ""Hey, there's a redheaded cow outside; you should all see it.""
"
12,9,Cartman,"Why not? You chicken? 
"
12,14,Butters,"There's vampires in the school!
"
12,7,Butters,"Let's do it!
"
8,6,Stan,"Hey, check it out, dude. Somebody bought the Donovan's old house. 
"
3,2,Stan,"What are you doing, dad?
"
9,6,Stan,"Why do we even hang out with him, anyway?
"
11,11,Cartman,"Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!
"
10,1,Stan,"You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good.
"
7,12,Butters,"Let him have it, Stan!
"
15,5,Kyle,"I knew you were doing something terrible!
"
17,6,Kyle,"Huh? Who...? Who is that?
"
15,13,Kenny,"(Yeah, that's true.)
"
6,8,Kyle,"You were totally, one hundred percent right.
"
11,8,Kyle,"Will you knock it off already?!
"
12,3,Stan,"Yeah, this is not gonna work.
"
8,5,Butters,"Huh? Oh, I dunno. It's around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?
"
1,6,Stan,"I'm not gonna kill you grampa.
"
14,2,Butters,"I don't even remember that.  But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
"
18,8,Butters,"But he's dying! 
"
9,14,Randy,"You're right, Stan. If God didn't make me stop drinking then... I did. Maybe... Maybe I can force myself to never drink again. 
"
6,5,Cartman,"Oh, God-dammit you better be kidding!
"
16,8,Randy,"Everyone! Everyone, listen! There's something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it's totally safe.  Yeah, it's super safe! It's like sooo safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh!  Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you're a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again.  Look, what I'm trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would-  God damn it!
"
17,1,Butters,"Your government doesn't listen in on you to punish you, your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Now she's doomed to walk the earth in limbo. 
"
2,13,Kyle,"No! Cartman, that was just a dream!
"
5,8,Stan,"Hello?
"
1,2,Kyle,"Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
"
7,9,Kyle,"What's the matter with him?
"
7,6,Stan,"Then to make it impossible for police to identify the body, he'd use a shovel to remove your head. 
"
1,9,Stan,"Wha-what is this about Christmas Poo, dude?
"
7,6,Cartman,"Bang bang bang... 
"
4,2,Kyle,"Oh my God, what if I'm not real?
"
6,1,Butters,"Well ah I don't know what to tell ya. Losin' weight is harder than puttin' it on.
"
18,5,Randy,"I wasn't doing anything wrong! This is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere!
"
5,13,Kyle,"He just said... ""Where's Stan?""
"
2,7,Kyle,"Holy crap, dude!  Hey look! He's got ice cream! 
"
2,14,Kyle,"He'd be better used as a coat rack. 
"
2,11,Butters,"Me, too!
"
2,10,Cartman,"Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha.
"
2,2,Kenny,"(Oh my God, they killed Mephesto!)
"
4,6,Cartman,"You wanna be my friend?
"
6,5,Stan,"That's worse!
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! M'KAY?!
"
10,10,Kyle,"Ex, excuse me?  My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Come on! 
"
1,11,Stan,"Are we making love now?
"
2,18,Stan,"Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him. 
"
2,18,Stan,"You suck as a best friend, Cartman!
"
14,14,Randy,"Come on!
"
11,3,Cartman,"But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! 
"
4,4,Stan,"Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice. 
"
14,7,Jimmy,"She's a candy cane to wiggle
"
14,1,Cartman,"Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?
"
7,12,Stan,"The... Book of Mormon? What's that?
"
14,11,Randy,"Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?
"
5,6,Cartman,"...and enjoy your stay at Cartmanland.  Ogh, finally, work is over. Now I can get back to riding my rides.  Dada da, I've got my own theme park. Hm, what should I go on now? I know! I'll go on the Haunted Mansion ride again!  Da dait daa da Da dat dadadadadadaa da-ah-  What are you doing?
"
5,8,Cartman,"This came out of you?? You just left it in the trashcan?!  You shouldn'ta done that. He's just a boih. Poor little feller.
"
8,3,Kyle,"If we as a people choose not to believe that Jesus is the Son of God, then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed, and take our share of the responsibility for it.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Yes, he did.
"
4,15,Stan,"Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
"
14,14,Randy,"Aww, stupid commercials.
"
9,13,Stan,"Kyle, it's all set to go!  Just get Willzy-x into the water! 
"
15,1,Cartman,"What?
"
1,3,Stan,"Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don't drink beer.
"
5,1,Cartman,"Don't mind Kyle, everyone, he's just got a little sand in his vagina.
"
12,14,Butters,"But there is. You guys gotta believe me. First there was just a couple, but now it's like they're growing. They have fangs and drink blood and everything.
"
18,7,Butters,"I'm troubled, I'm troubled in mind. If Jesus don't help me I surely will die. 
"
10,3,Cartman,"Holy Crap! 
"
13,8,Cartman,"Except! You can't afford buying all the new underwear?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Ten dollar? Eight dollar? You give me eight dollar, soldier boy!
"
4,1,Stan,"It's not?
"
17,1,Cartman,"It's too late for me, Butters. I have to go to Russia and live with the Commie dwarfs.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Wuwhat's going on?
"
2,16,Stan,"Kyle, we are in a house filled with Cartmans.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Oh hey guys. How's it going?
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike, I don't care if you wanna grow up, I just wanna be by your side while you do it.
"
8,9,Randy,"Television department... All right, come on, let's go!  Oh my God!
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"It's strange, but suddenly I feel really confident about myself, and I've decided to quit teaching, and do what I've always dreamed of doing: hang out and screw hot chicks.
"
7,14,Stan,"No. No, Butters, that doesn't sound stupid at all.
"
8,11,Cartman,"And panda bears for the preschoolers.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
"
9,3,Cartman,"Who let-?
"
11,7,Kyle,"All right, hit it.
"
1,13,Kyle,"You live on the Eastside, Cartman!
"
16,5,Stan,"I didn't know.
"
2,14,Kenny,"(All right dude, let me go now!) 
"
4,14,Cartman,"And where... pray... is our beautiful trick performing turkey?
"
10,6,Stan,"Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now.
"
11,7,Randy,"No sign of anybody else.
"
18,7,Butters,"Well, not a hundred percent...
"
7,2,Jimmy,"But nobody can leave until it's seven a.m., so if you wanna have a good time, you're all just gonna have to learn to get along.  Theeerrre's pizzaaa.
"
13,1,Butters,"Fellas! Hey fellas! I heard that Kenny is still going out with that slut Tammy Warner.
"
10,1,Stan,"Oh my God... They killed Chef.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Sir, we are in business!
"
2,12,Wendy,"Okay.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Cartman, where are you going??
"
10,6,Stan,"Me??
"
9,12,Stan,"Neither did I! But now, if you guys can't accept this great thing I belong to, then I suppose we're no longer friends! 
"
16,11,Butters,"Uhbu-but I'm from here.
"
3,13,Cartman,"What the hell is ""Hooked On Monkey Fonics?""
"
16,4,Cartman,"So God makes it rain frogs? That just seems kind of mean to frogs, Kyle.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Oh gee! That's a good idea! My mom isn't paying you to be a comedian!
"
9,8,Randy,"All we can do... is try to wait it out, as long as we can.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Ike Broflovski?
"
5,13,Cartman,"Heh, sorry. 
"
16,5,Cartman,"We're putting up movie posters, Kyle! The premiere is tomorrow! But since you walked out on the video, you don't get to come! 
"
14,2,Cartman,"That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something.
"
6,15,Stan,"Chef, Cartman is in the hospital. They think he might die.
"
3,8,Butters,"Uh, so you mean we can stay friends, Stan? Wouldn't that be swell, huh?
"
11,1,Cartman,"It's a midget, dude.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Hey!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Nothing dude, it's cool, it's cool. I mean, we would tell your parents to shop at nicer places, but... your mom is so poor she can't even pay attention. 
"
2,9,Wendy,"Wow! Cool!
"
8,11,Cartman,"It should be Sexy News.
"
14,8,Butters,"Yeah, he's a champion alright.
"
13,10,Butters,"I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! 
"
3,11,Kyle,"Where are we?
"
6,14,Randy,"Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.
"
6,4,Stan,"Butters? Buh-Butters! You have your arm around me! 
"
1,3,Cartman,"Hey, I didn't get a gun.  Sweet. This is like the gun I used in 'Nam
"
4,16,Stan,"Well, they can't be too pissed off. I mean, we made them a banner.
"
10,3,Stan,"The hell's going on now?!
"
17,5,Kyle,"What?
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m'kay.
"
14,6,Kyle,"That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Aw dude, don't do that. That's gay.
"
15,4,Randy,"Power to the people! Burn it down! Burn it down!!
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"—You need to work on your study skills!
"
15,5,Cartman,"But of course you own slaves, because, oh... riiight.  Of couse you don't have desire to own slaves, son, neither do I. And if there was any government agency listenin' in on this heah conversation, they should know that we'er not talkin' 'bout slave ownership. Gaauu.  Alright, so now, how do you get around not paying your slaves.
"
8,9,Cartman,"No, you didn't.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.
"
7,11,Kyle,"Uh Butters didn't show. You wanna go to Casa Bonita with us?
"
1,2,Cartman,"Beefcake!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters.
"
1,7,Stan,"Oh, good, you're here. Now let's make sure we got everything. Flashlight...
"
12,8,Kyle,"WHY ARE THEY DOING THIIIS?!
"
18,8,Stan,"We're men.
"
16,6,Stan,"Help! We're trapped!  We've gotta get out of here!
"
6,2,Kyle,"Mom, Dad!
"
12,8,Stan,"You can't keep torturing yourself like this, Kyle. Let it... go.
"
4,10,Stan,"Confession box is over there! 
"
16,2,Kyle,"That... was six grand?
"
9,14,Randy,"Hello, Stan.
"
6,2,Kyle,"No, dude, you're supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee.
"
10,3,Kyle,"Dude, it's a good show.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Mom, give me some money!
"
8,3,Kyle,"...Thanks. 
"
15,8,Stan,"Fuck you Kyle, you're a piece of shit!  ...Kyle, I love you.  You're a piece of shit though. Fuck you!  ...I love you. 
"
4,13,Kyle,"You ba--! 
"
7,3,Kyle,"How the hell did they find out it was us that TP'ed that house?
"
5,11,Cartman,"1, 2, 3, 4...
"
18,3,Butters,"Yeah, what's the big idea harassing Erica, Stan?!
"
15,1,Cartman,"No!
"
15,5,Kyle,"You don't think that-? But he isn't real.
"
16,8,Randy,"Yeah, the players should all wear bras! And instead of helmets, they should wear little tinfoil hats, 'cause, you know, it's the future and we shouldn't be so barbaric! 
"
8,5,Cartman,"I said I'm a real person, asswipe!
"
2,17,Stan,"Kind of bitter.
"
7,13,Cartman,"I'm not eating the cupcake.
"
7,15,Cartman,"You really think if we go to Canada we might still get Christmas presents?
"
14,1,Kyle,"Jesus, dude.
"
2,5,Cartman,"What? Don't you have dodgeball in France?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia. 
"
7,3,Butters,"Hi, Dad.
"
3,5,Stan,"Where are you going?
"
15,4,Cartman,"Wait, what?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Naw, I just-- I had to get away, m-m'kay? I just lost my job.
"
13,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, parents, some of you have already heard, but most of you have not, m'kay? We've had a terrible incident occur at the school. Apparently a young girl uh, went up to a young boy here at the school, m'kay, and queefed in his face. 
"
16,9,Stan,"Dude, you've never seen Honey Boo Boo?
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Come on you little bitch.  You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy.
"
1,3,Stan,"I did it, I did it, I finally killed something. 
"
16,9,Kyle,"What??
"
17,9,Stan,"Get out of here!
"
18,9,Kyle,"Heeey Ike! Look what I got.  The new Call Of Duty! Do you wanna go downstairs and play?
"
13,14,Jimmy,"Okay, w-where's the maintenance room?
"
11,1,Randy,"Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called ""nigger guys""? 
"
12,10,Randy,"Huh?
"
3,2,Randy,"Mayor, I think I'm a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems.
"
6,10,Butters,"Stupider than Bebe!
"
17,7,Stan,"Exactly!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Dude, I'm saying I'm sorry.
"
16,11,Butters,"Yeah?
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh, jeez, you wouldn't have believed how angry I was when Teacher said I had to share my fingerpaints, because I've been sharin' them all along.
"
8,5,Butters,"Hm, okay. Let's see  Oh, my parents don't know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.
"
1,12,Cartman,"We'll roshambo for it!
"
3,14,Stan,"You can't just come to a Civil War reenactment dressed up like General Lee, fatass!
"
16,7,Cartman,"Motherfucker! 
"
3,6,Stan,"Hoh, whatever! 
"
3,9,Kyle,"He doesn't get cake?
"
5,6,Cartman,"I'm not keeping it, Mr. Garrison, I'm spending it.
"
4,17,Kyle,"Okay, where are the E-mouths?
"
15,5,Cartman,"They can't make money. It's against the rules.
"
16,2,Stan,"She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa.
"
3,1,Cartman,"I don't think it's funny! This place is overcrowded, smelly, and poor! That's not funny, that sucks!
"
1,11,Wendy,"Hooray! Hooray! Hooray for Mr. Garrison!  He's back! He's back! Mr. Garrison is back! So loong, substitute. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, now.
"
9,14,Randy,"Stan I... need your help.
"
5,6,Cartman,"Great. Now can we go?
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"But the good news is,  I've already talked to Principal Victoria about it and Ms. Ellen can stay on as your permanent teacher. 
"
2,3,Kyle,"How about a brain transplant? 
"
2,16,Cartman,"Lock the door! 
"
9,10,Kyle,"Stan, there was never anything between Wendy and I.  I wouldn't go out with my best friend's ex-girlfriend.
"
15,5,Butters,"I know. It's messin' with my head so hard.
"
1,10,Cartman,"Oooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mon's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.
"
11,9,Randy,"In Zurich?
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Run for your lives, children!  I'll try to fight it off!
"
2,8,Kyle,"What do ya mean?
"
18,2,Cartman,"What kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake? Now all we've got is Lorde.
"
8,7,Stan,"I was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin' tuh- 
"
17,5,Kyle,"Hey Ike, how's it going?
"
12,1,Cartman,"...Ice cream?
"
9,2,Kenny,"(Sonofabitch!) 
"
3,16,Cartman,"Wow, cool!
"
6,17,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell has gotten into Cartman??
"
18,9,Randy,"And what if you go and Lorde doesn't sound that great in person?
"
18,2,Kyle,"We're good, Scott. Stop bugging us. 
"
9,2,Kyle,"You're doing what?
"
6,17,Stan,"Wow! Look, you guys! Santa got us all Haibo dolls! 
"
6,1,Butters,"Huh. Huh, uh, uh.
"
14,1,Kyle,"Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Hoh! I can't sleep; it's too cold, m'kay?
"
11,5,Kyle,"What?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Goddamnit, I have to find that videotape!
"
7,13,Stan,"Why?
"
3,14,Kyle,"Well Cartman, the South lost! That mean you're our slave for a month!
"
4,7,Stan,"Kyle's in trouble, Cartman. I can see him getting worse right before my eyes. There might be a way that you... can save his life.
"
6,1,Stan,"Fifteen dowlar? But... Jared got millions!
"
11,5,Stan,"Yeah.
"
1,13,Randy,"Is there-uh anything we can do for you, son?
"
14,5,Cartman,"By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Oh heeell NO you didn't just invade my privacy again?! That is the LAST STRAW, Kyle!  Everybody! Everybody hey! Just so you know, we might have an NSA agent right here at our school
"
12,1,Kyle,"Wugh.
"
5,8,Cartman,"Kenny!
"
6,8,Kyle,"It is stupid and immature! So you got people to crap out of their mouths! What do you want, a feakin' medal?!
"
3,17,Cartman,"Heh, heh. No, seriously. Kyle's mom says Kyle's getting really good at fingering, heh. 
"
8,7,Kyle,"What?!
"
7,2,Cartman,"Oh God-damnit!!
"
1,11,Wendy,"Wait, wait!  It's time to whip out the eclipse shoebox thing!  Bye-bye, Ms. Ellen.
"
15,9,Kyle,"He was with us at dinner. Wait. Was he with us at dinner?
"
15,14,Kyle,"Dude, I don't think Kenny's coming back. My dad said those Child Protective Services people are pretty serious.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Jesus Christ!
"
14,14,Randy,"Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home!  I'll be right back!
"
17,6,Kyle,"About what?!
"
11,1,Stan,"Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it.
"
10,8,Randy,"Stan... 
"
9,9,Cartman,"Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of the boy, and mankind. In a few moments, we will know the future. 
"
13,14,Cartman,"I read Treasure Island, because I was so happy when I saw that movie.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(No, fuck you! She's my girl!)
"
17,1,Cartman,"Look, I am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake! Eric Cartman is the NSA's worst nightmare!
"
9,9,Butters,"My mom?  Hello?

14,8,Cartman,"Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR.
"
9,11,Kyle,"We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.
"
7,3,Kyle,"We're, we're in trouble. We're in sooo much trouble.
"
10,12,Cartman,"Safe where, butthole?!
"
13,7,Cartman,"Your brother is with Butters taking inventory of our latest plunder, Kyle. You... just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money, hmhmm.
"
1,6,Cartman,"Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!
"
5,2,Stan,"Dude, this looks like it could get ugly. 
"
9,14,Randy,"Gotta try to take it easy from now on, son. Get Daddy another beer, will ya?
"
5,1,Cartman,"So am I, Kyle. If that sand in your vagina doesn't get released, you could become a walking time bomb. 
"
3,4,Cartman,"Dude, if Craig and Tweek got in a fight, Craig would kick Tweek's ass.
"
1,13,Cartman,"Weh hunh hrhrh hrh huh-right! Like I'm some hippie Indian.  You know what I'm sayin' G? Check you later-I'm gonna go chill with mide-my dad. 
"
4,16,Butters,"Hoh, hahh, can I- help you folks?
"
7,13,Stan,"Yeah, maybe you're right. 
"
4,7,Stan,"I don't know what else to do. I mean, he could die, Kenny. And that means we'd never see him again.
"
5,4,Kyle,"...What?
"
8,8,Kyle,"...Dude, you're supposed to vote for Giant Douche.
"
1,1,Cartman,"No!
"
17,1,Cartman,"I am extremely qualified, sir, and very eager to work.
"
9,14,Randy,"Shh! Trying to concentrate!  Just hold the damn wheel! 
"
6,10,Cartman,"It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Turd sandwich.
"
9,6,Butters,"HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Totally!
"
12,6,Stan,"My Internet's not working either.
"
15,10,Stan,"Kenny! Kenny, what the fuck?!
"
5,13,Butters,"Yeah, he ah knew you'd say that, too, so he said t'say, uh, up your ass, Jew.  Yeah.
"
3,8,Butters,"No, uh I get to be Jaclyn Smith. See, uh I thought of Charlie's Angels, and I get to be Jaclyn Smith 'cause I thought of it.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Sweet.
"
9,1,Stan,"Kyle, you have to cheer up, dude. So you aren't built right for basketball.
"
5,8,Cartman,"Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Okay, fine, I guess we'll look for- Oh no!! Look out! It's a giant four-headed lava frog! Shoot it!  Oh no, it got Kyle!
"
3,14,Kyle,"The South loses this battle, Cartman. They lose the war!
"
10,1,Stan,"What??
"
2,14,Stan,"Cartman just needs to put more into it. Dance better, Cartman!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Okay, all set!
"
2,15,Stan,"Do you remember what pet store?
"
6,4,Cartman,"No, Uncle Jesse, no!
"
15,7,Kyle,"What's that?
"
3,13,Cartman,"You're going down, bitch!
"
14,3,Cartman,"Good.
"
7,12,Mr. Garrison,"Okay now, who can tell me what year the first astronauts landed on the moon? 
"
4,17,Kyle,"Mayor! We have the solution to your problem.
"
15,9,Butters,"Game on!
"
2,2,Kyle,"D'you have any wire here?
"
12,10,Kyle,"That's not true. Kids at school like us. Don't they?
"
18,7,Stan,"Yes, we're here.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well uh, how long did you wait before you had... uh... doobers.
"
8,13,Kyle,"Excuse me, sir? I think I know who did this. We saw this guy at the last crime scene, and, and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime? Well, I followed this guy to his house, and when he left again, I collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis.  I'm pretty sure he's your man.
"
18,5,Butters,"My dad and I shot it yesterday at the lake.
"
10,2,Cartman,"Dude, what are you doing?
"
8,10,Stan,"No, you're not doing it either! We just need to find something that looks like boobs to take a picture of.
"
1,7,Wendy,"I thought you would reach the same conclusion, so, I came as Chewbacca. 
"
4,6,Kyle,"They are?
"
2,12,Cartman,"It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole.
"
6,11,Randy,"What the hell are they doin' here?! Rabble! Rabble rabble!
"
9,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well, because uh, Jimmy is pitching a tent right now. 
"
7,15,Cartman,"You fucking asshole!! This is all your fault!!
"
4,10,Randy,"Oh, now look at that. They're scared to death.
"
16,14,Cartman,"What if I did, Kyle?
"
16,3,Stan,"No, no, no! These stupid fads are only that, okay? We can't give in to this crap.
"
3,14,Cartman,"I am keepin' the beat; your flute-playing sucks!
"
3,5,Stan,"Yeah. I guess he finally found something that's as annoying as he is.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
"
2,12,Wendy,"Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!
"
8,11,Butters,"Will do.
"
4,1,Kyle,"They on'tday?!  Why the ellhay otnay?! It ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this Od-damnedgay akecay, and ownay we're otallytay ewedscray!
"
13,13,Cartman,"You just want somebody to read what's in front of them like a brain-washed zombie, is that it Mr. Mackey? I am not Gordon Stoltski, okay?! I'm not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what he's told, until he's killed!
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"That's great! And now we can sell all their homes, and become... millionaires!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Mmm. I can't possibly finish this whole cake. Oh, yes I can. 
"
9,4,Cartman,"I can't wait to see the look on everyone's faces when I show up to school with a PSP! I wonder if Kyle will cry? Oh PLEASE let Kyle cry!  What the hell?!
"
3,17,Stan,"Stop! Stop! 
"
15,10,Stan,"Come on dude, it's pretty funny.
"
5,14,Butters,"Lie?
"
8,10,Stan,"Hey, Kenny's right. We should put out a real fire. Then we'll be heroes!
"
16,3,Kyle,"Two, one. Go Cartman!
"
3,13,Kyle,"""Krocsyldiphic."" C  Damnit!
"
6,6,Jimmy,"Well, I don't think I did too well in the... bathing suit competition. But I can't wait for the talent show competition. That'll really my chance to... shine.  Wow, what a terrific audience. So anyway, a guy walks into a buh- ...A guy walks into a b- ...buh...  A guy walks into a guy walks into a  babuh ba-a-a, uh- 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Ow! 
"
18,2,Jimmy,"Yeah well, no one's laughing, Kyle. 
"
4,2,Kyle,"Did the tooth fairy come?
"
14,8,Butters,"Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be.
"
7,7,Kyle,"Boy, that really did the trick, Stan. I thought we were kind of, sort of, not really done for.
"
13,6,Randy,"Okay, let's ah put the wheels on now, son.
"
6,2,Kyle,"...French fries... pizza... french fries...  come on, Cartman.
"
1,7,Kyle,"Uh, okay. Then what?
"
15,10,Kyle,"What's that?
"
13,1,Cartman,"Her name's Tammy Warner. She's the only girl in school whose family is actually poorer than Kenny's. It's really kind of beautiful if you ask me.
"
8,5,Cartman,"...What?
"
15,10,Cartman,"Excused? Oh, oh but we are in the middle of class. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"Yeah, I think so.
"
14,2,Stan,"They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!
"
15,9,Butters,"Fellow Meheecans! This time, we're gonan try rushin' the Texans from the left side! Do not give up home, for I am Mantequilla! Viva la Meheeco!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Butters!
"
6,5,Stan,"AGH!  Wait! Chef just got a new plasma TV with surround-sound. Let's go to his house! Come on! 
"
6,11,Kyle,"You're such a fatass, Cartman.
"
11,2,Cartman,"Why would you tell anybody?
"
4,14,Cartman,"Dude, we need your turkey for our play!
"
5,9,Kyle,"Yeah, you can't get it if you don't breathe.
"
18,6,Randy,"Well all right! Good for you guys. Tell you what, I'll join you. Board games go good with a glass of wine. 
"
16,7,Butters,"They'll find love somewhere else.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Mmmm, noooo, Because I don't want to. Aaaand we can't just change the name of our company 'cause it's like super hard. But hey, from one Redskin to another, go fuck yourself. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"No Kitty, that a bad God-damned kitty! 
"
11,10,Kyle,"I didn't suck his balls, all right?! And I'm not going to!
"
18,7,Butters,"Please! You can't do that! I have to find a way out of this!
"
10,1,Kyle,"No! Hey!
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Uh. U-uh, taking over any conversation's bad.
"
3,15,Stan,"I'll try
"
4,13,Stan,"Dude, what's your little brother doing here?
"
1,1,Stan,"Yeah.
"
1,11,Wendy,"Well, she did! And she has horrible, horrible gas, too! She says she can't control it!
"
18,8,Kyle,"Should be the next one. 2778 Mala Vista Drive. Wait, this is City Wok.
"
4,16,Kyle,"Because we do. It was like this yesterday, and the day before that.
"
2,9,Kyle,"There it is again! 
"
6,10,Wendy,"That's what I said.
"
5,4,Kyle,"We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch.
"
8,14,Kyle,"No. I'm Jewish.
"
13,13,Cartman,"A book signing.
"
13,6,Randy,"Here, see? Here look, look real close at the axles here.  Yeahaah! Ahalright, you got him son!
"
4,10,Stan,"What happened??
"
16,10,Cartman,"HaHA Kyle! Let's see you try and take my iPod headphones HOW! 
"
2,9,Kyle,"It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble. 
"
16,10,Stan,"You're gonna have to tell him, dude.
"
10,8,Cartman,"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?
"
11,5,Kyle,"Who is Saint Peter?
"
5,8,Cartman,"Hey, it's like all bloody. It might be alive.
"
11,1,Butters,"Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! 
"
4,16,Kyle,"What??
"
12,8,Butters,"Waah! 
"
1,7,Stan,"We'll hold 'em off.
"
2,6,Cartman,"What?
"
8,6,Kyle,"All right. Thanks a lot for helping us, dude.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
"
8,2,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! I have the best idea ever! I'm gonna be rich!
"
5,5,Cartman,"Racist! 
"
16,4,Cartman,"No! The bread's all flat! No!  Aaaaahhhh! 
"
8,10,Butters,"Hey fellas, you'd better be careful.
"
2,18,Stan,"They're after you! 
"
7,3,Cartman,"For oth-er...  Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?
"
2,11,Stan,"Oh, no! They got Chef, too!
"
10,6,Stan,"Cartman?
"
12,11,Randy,"Oh God.  I'm-  I'm so-  Startled.  ARRRGH!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Can somebody drive us to the mall?
"
13,10,Jimmy,"Face it: Stan's crappy singing is what sssunk us!
"
7,8,Kyle,"No! Ah!
"
3,7,Cartman,"What should we do, Artemus Clyde Frog? 
"
6,17,Kyle,"Jesus, behind you! 
"
13,13,Cartman,"Thank you so much for finally coming on my show, Wendy.
"
5,10,Kyle,"Ehheh, Cartman, what the hell are you doing?
"
10,14,Randy,"Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Ugh. I don't wanna play anymore, you guys.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"I have a raging hard-on that just won't quit, and the talent show has already started.
"
7,10,Cartman,"Oh God, they're coming! 
"
6,9,Stan,"Waitwaitwaitwait!  Don't you see what's happening out there? The films you all grew up with, that touched YOUR lives and are part of YOUR soul are now being updated and changed. Join us and we CAN be a group that makes a difference!
"
7,15,Cartman,"Aw dude, it smells like Kung Pao chicken in here!
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"What?
"
15,4,Cartman,"Why the fuck am I here?!
"
18,5,Butters,"Ah, hold on Dad. I should be sleepin'. Why do you ask?
"
10,8,Stan,"Yeah.
"
8,14,Stan,"Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!
"
3,2,Stan,"Oh my God, what's going on?
"
5,6,Cartman,"Oho, Goddamnit, this sucks!
"
11,12,Butters,"How?
"
13,5,Cartman,"What are you up to?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Thanks you guys!
"
7,14,Butters,"Oh wait, Lexus. Jeheez, I almost forgot. Ah I got you this present.
"
8,11,Cartman,"This sucks. I don't wanna keep havin' to come up with ideas for shows all the time. It hurts my head. 
"
18,7,Cartman,"You only have eight minutes before the battery protocol dies Butters. You have to hurry!
"
3,2,Kyle,"Well, my dad is, too.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Know what?
"
8,2,Kyle,"I came here to talk about you!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody, and I think maybe you're the only person who won't make f-f-fun of me.
"
3,3,Cartman,"You know what?! Screw Chef! There, I said it! Screw him! Let him marry a succubus! I wanna go to sleep. 
"
16,14,Kyle,"We found it, you guys!  Oh no, they followed us! 
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yes, I did! I said from the beginning that you would do this!
"
8,7,Kyle,"A break from what?! You haven't done anything!
"
1,1,Cartman,"Ahh, son of a bitch!
"
8,13,Cartman,"... 'Kay. Sweet.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Look at, look at the description. Brown eye! 
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
6,6,Kyle,"But right now I'd say if we're gonna have a retard for a friend, I, I have to pick Timmy. Because Timmy doesn't tell any jokes.
"
16,5,Stan,"...It's about awareness dude. Don't you understand how important this is? Bullying? Did you know that in America, hohoh, over 200,000 students are afraid to come to school every day because of-
"
6,6,Stan,"Yeah, it's not bad. Next? 
"
14,9,Cartman,"What the hell are you guys doing?!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!
"
1,4,Cartman,"Man, that is the gayest dog I've ever seen.
"
6,3,Kyle,"Do you think they'll believe it?
"
17,10,Butters,"So then, ah, the fella with the mustache eats all the cupcakes, and the lady takes out a gun and puts it in his face and she says ""I""-
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Yeah, I think so.)
"
10,2,Stan,"Kyle? Kyle!
"
1,6,Kyle,"Well, it, it looks like...
"
4,17,Stan,"What is this all about, Kyle?
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Anyone for some meteor mai tai punch? It packs quite a wallop.
"
16,1,Randy,"Yeah, how will Nelson and I make an X on sleepover nights?
"
9,5,Randy,"I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, Sharon. But you have to take Stan to his Little League game alone. 
"
9,9,Cartman,"Dude, they totally think he's a girl. 
"
7,3,Butters,"Officer, can I stay in jail, please?
"
18,2,Cartman,"I don't know the way, Aunt Jemima.
"
1,5,Cartman,"Why?  Is your sister gonna kick your ass again?
"
12,9,Cartman,"Not at all.  ""Wendy, we're gonna get you Wendy. We're your boobs, we're gonna kill you!""
"
3,1,Stan,"But we don't even care about the rainforest.
"
18,7,Butters,"Eric! Uh what are you doing here?
"
18,1,Kyle,"It's so awesome, dude. Our company already has a hundred backers. And we still have 14 days to go!
"
6,7,Kyle,"Oh, really?? 
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmy.
"
13,3,Kyle,"Whoever it might happen to be, I'm not giving him the opportunity. Tomorrow I'm going to do something. Something I've known I would have to do restore people's faith.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Hey, why did you guys forfeit?
"
5,13,Stan,"Yeah. I'm gonna see my friend, because he needs me right now.
"
4,1,Butters,"Wuh-okay! You guys ready up there!?
"
8,8,Stan,"I...
"
2,12,Kyle,"Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy. 
"
2,10,Stan,"We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
"
2,16,Kyle,"What is this??
"
16,3,Kyle,"It wasn't like Faith Hilling was that great. I mean-
"
7,15,Kenny,"(Me neither!)
"
17,10,Butters,"Well Kim Kardashian is skinny and she just had a baby!
"
3,2,Kyle,"I forgot all about him. 
"
13,6,Randy,"It was... a trick?
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"NO, we can't do fingerpaint! You kids wanna get herpes?! Huh?! How about a nice bucket of AIDS?! Sound good?! Now pay attention, alright? I'm going to show you the proper way to put on a condom.  First of all you remove the condom from its package.  Then you find which way the condom rolls out.  Put it in your mouth...  And apply.  And it's as simple as that. Any questions?
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"Settle down, children. I have some difficult news. This is going to make you all very sad.  The school board is considering firing me as your teacher. There's a possibility that I will be let go and never allowed to teach you again.  Yes, Stanley?
"
3,3,Kyle,"Bitch.
"
9,1,Kyle,"I beat out YOUR fat ass, Cartman! 
"
2,12,Cartman,"Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over.
"
14,6,Kyle,"Wwait, what?
"
12,4,Kyle,"Can you act like you're giving him a lot?
"
7,10,Randy,"Awgh. Stan, it's not that simple! Just relax while I find the lights. Here we go. 
"
6,7,Stan,"Alright, I'll chip in.
"
11,12,Stan,"So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
"
18,7,Kyle,"Get up, Cartman!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Am I sure?? Look at this place!
"
16,10,Stan,"But are you sure they had sex, like, ""sex"" sex, or they actually had sex? 
"
14,4,Randy,"Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?
"
4,13,Kyle,"He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Are you mocking me?! Because if you are, I have no problem sending your butt to the principal's office!
"
12,4,Butters,"Aaah. 
"
9,10,Wendy,"Don't let anything happen to it, please. 
"
6,3,Stan,"We know. You're the one doing it, Butters. Who'd you think we were talkin' about?
"
6,12,Stan,"We've gotta find that ticket!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Yes. The life of a ninja is complex and full of peril.  Come on, ninjas!
"
9,6,Cartman,"Don't worry, Butters, I'm gonna get you out of here.
"
13,4,Cartman,"Hey Butters. How you holding up, man?
"
15,8,Kyle,"I've tried, Wendy. I've called him, I've been to his house. But since his diagnosis, all he's done is gotten worse.
"
4,11,Butters,"He had sins that he didn't confess!
"
6,12,Kyle,"Are you gonna burn me?
"
8,3,Cartman,"Mom! Doorbell!
"
10,14,Stan,"Oh uh, hey Nelson.
"
17,7,Randy,"You-d, you do?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Actually it was potato chips.
"
15,5,Cartman,"How can Slash be playing in Colorado Springs and Moscow at the same time?!
"
11,9,Randy,"I would need a lot of help.
"
6,12,Cartman,"What did you say?!
"
4,1,Stan,"Look, girls don't even know how to sled. Do something else.
"
12,11,Stan,"Dude, we we have to go check this out.
"
6,2,Cartman,"Shh-shh, here he comes.
"
6,10,Stan,"Aw alright, I guess we can all watch Terrance & Phillip together. 
"
6,17,Jimmy,"...and a par-tridge in a... p...pear tree. On the ...fourth day of C...C...Ca...Chriiiistmas my t-true love g-ge-gave to me-mee.
"
3,16,Stan,"Jesus, why does God hate me?
"
2,7,Stan,"But the monster outside couldn't be Mr. Garrison, 'cause Mr. Garrison used a gun.
"
5,10,Cartman,"Ugh.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Well, what's the Evil Power?
"
9,13,Kyle,"No way!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Detention! That's it! 
"
15,8,Stan,"Yeah dude, I totally get it now. I can see how lame I was saying everything was, was shit.
"
4,7,Stan,"Dude, what the hell was that?
"
18,8,Cartman,"Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh Kenny?
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"What?
"
12,14,Cartman,"Oh man, you've got to be kidding me. God damn Japs are everywhere. 
"
12,2,Cartman,"Aw dude, that's our town!
"
6,5,Kyle,"The last commercial break is starting!
"
11,2,Stan,"You can't!
"
4,9,Timmy,"Haaghh.  Timmih, livin' a lie!
"
2,5,Kyle,"Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!
"
15,5,Cartman,"Oh my God... It's genius, Kyle!
"
13,2,Cartman,"You're a fag, Kyle! Fuck you!
"
5,4,Cartman,"No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. 
"
2,16,Cartman,"Okay.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Well, Mom said I could sleep in the guest room tonight. Good night, Dad.
"
9,9,Butters,"Lezzing out? What's lezzing out?
"
10,8,Cartman,"More Hot Pockets!
"
5,9,Stan,"Here. Wu-we don't want it.
"
13,4,Cartman,"Last week at our school, a girl queefed right into our friend's face. That is why we are here to tell you  it's not a joke.
"
6,13,Randy,"Okay, problem solved.
"
13,4,Cartman,"Ah ah ah, that's my seat, Craig.
"
18,3,Randy,"You think you're gonna get a good product when I can't even think?!
"
15,7,Kyle,"Gross!
"
3,4,Stan,"Okay, so, just to set the record straight here, the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 3:30. Tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds, Craig at 45.
"
7,4,Kenny,"(A what?)
"
15,7,Kyle,"NO. Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.
"
14,4,Cartman,"'Cause people think I'm cool, dude.
"
11,1,Randy,"We did it!
"
13,1,Butters,"Well, I just talked to Brad Dixon. Tammy Warner is bad news. All the fifth graders call her a slut, on account of she gave this kid Dave Darsky a B.J. in the parking lot of TGI Friday's.
"
1,1,Kyle,"No!
"
8,4,Cartman,"Dude, these little remote-controlled cars are kickass. 
"
5,5,Stan,"Our town in Colorado was chosen to host Earth Day this year and... we need a big act.
"
2,8,Stan,"Jesus, Cartman!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Hey, Jakov, how's it going?
"
13,8,Cartman,"Yeah yeah rah work it Michael work it!
"
17,5,Kyle,"You use IntelliLink?? Oh my God! Will you check his records please?
"
4,10,Stan,"Okay, let's see. Uuh, oh yeah, there was the time we threw a fish into the busdriver's hair and she didn't find it for seven days.
"
16,14,Butters,"Well... hah... HWAAAH! 
"
16,4,Cartman,"What does that mean?
"
10,13,Cartman,"I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!
"
9,8,Cartman,"Not so fast, Kyle.
"
7,3,Cartman,"I'm getting rid of our problem. Kyle will be dead in a matter of hours.
"
14,6,Mr. Garrison,"They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions!
"
6,14,Stan,"No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher.
"
9,2,Cartman,"You're the scientist, jackass!
"
2,10,Cartman,"Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!
"
2,2,Cartman,"No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, ""Come Sail Away"", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Uh-I wanna talk to you about your son—I'm his n-therapist, m'kay.
"
5,4,Cartman,"That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
"
2,4,Stan,"Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris.
"
17,1,Cartman,"What's this?
"
10,7,Cartman,"Maaaa. Mommm.  Mommm.
"
12,3,Kyle,"Dad? Dad! What the hell are you doing?!
"
1,7,Cartman,"Yeah, granola pisses me off. 
"
15,12,Wendy,"We ARE here because of you, Eric, so just keep your mouth shut!
"
2,9,Kyle,"You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Oh, cool.
"
3,4,Cartman,"Those sons of bitches!
"
7,4,Cartman,"...Eh the... Founding who? 
"
16,7,Stan,"What? 
"
16,3,Kyle,"We have to face it, Cartman.
"
14,3,Kyle,"...so no KFC?
"
4,11,Kenny,"(Ahow..!)
"
3,14,Cartman,"Where are you going?
"
13,13,Wendy,"I'm not giving Eric Fartman one minute of my time, you got that?! I'm not acknowledging his stupid questions. If you want him dealt with, you'll have to do it yourself! 
"
12,11,Cartman,"Yeah, maybe we should start heading that way. 
"
5,13,Kyle,"...What? 
"
10,1,Kyle,"All right, come on guys!
"
9,7,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, uhh, Jimmy, why don't you come up here and write down the names of two narcotics?
"
13,11,Stan,"Screw this! Turn hard to port! 
"
6,12,Kyle,"What do you mean, fatass?
"
4,13,Stan,"So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?
"
16,14,Kyle,"What the hell is this?
"
1,7,Kyle,"Dammit!
"
6,5,Butters,"Aw! Oh man! Uh, uh uh uh...
"
4,10,Cartman,"Well, it looks like we're gonna have to save Timmy, Kyle, and everyone else in this town from the angry hand of God ourselves!
"
8,6,Stan,"Yeah. A really bad dream.  Oh Jesus!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Put this on. We have to stay hidden from here out. 
"
5,13,Cartman,"...What?! We made a deal, Larry! I brought them all the way down here already!
"
2,7,Kyle,"Don't be stupid, Cartman. Our teacher wouldn't be out lying in the forest waiting to kill us!
"
17,2,Randy,"No, just the usual cable-company stuff.
"
3,2,Stan,"It ain't bad. You should try reading it sometime. 
"
5,7,Cartman,"I'm putting on a new condom. I filled the other one up.
"
14,2,Cartman,"And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!
"
4,9,Stan,"Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.
"
2,12,Stan,"Hello?
"
12,10,Cartman,"And we'll double your money in one afternoon, Craig.
"
2,5,Cartman,"Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?
"
12,7,Cartman,"Don't worry, they're not gonna find us 'til we're safely back inside.  Look, see that traffic signal down there?  If we can climb across that, we can jump to the tree branch, and then we're home free.
"
16,4,Cartman,"It's just a legend, alright?! But people all over town have started reported strange things. Knocked over trash cans, weird howls...
"
16,5,Stan,"I can't believe what I'm hearing!  This is why bullying is getting worse and worse at out schools! We can't all sit by and let it happen anymore!
"
4,17,Stan,"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
"
2,15,Kyle,"What?
"
6,3,Butters,"Uhhh, yeah.
"
16,13,Stan,"You got nothin' better to do than try and knock me down?! You can't just say anything you want about people!
"
3,17,Cartman,"That was pretty cool.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Haha, charade you are, Scott! 
"
4,11,Cartman,"Jesus, ix-nay on the ool-schay.
"
7,9,Stan,"What a dumbass. Our band is way cooler than his.
"
7,10,Stan,"Uh, Grandpa, I don't think you should be driving.
"
13,12,Mr. Mackey,"You just admitted to spray-painting that they should get out of town!
"
10,11,Randy,"What?
"
15,10,Mr. Garrison,"They're not fish like some of you retards chose.
"
17,9,Stan,"I have no idea.
"
6,16,Butters,"Boy, it sure is stinky in here!
"
10,8,Stan,"Got it.
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
12,4,Kyle,"Yeah. Everyone thinks I'm a homo now.
"
18,9,Cartman,"CartmaaanBrah!
"
2,16,Cartman,"All right. Give me $10. 
"
2,3,Kyle,"Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
"
16,7,Kyle,"Will you shut the hell up?! 
"
12,8,Cartman,"I really don't care anymore, Butters. You see, I've learned something today. As Americans our fear of seeing another country become powerful can turn us into monsters. Watching how crazy you went. Watching you just... shoot people in the dick like that. It made me realize that I want America to be safe, but not at the cost of losing its dignity. I'd rather us be... Chinese... than a nation of unethical dickshooters.  You think about it. 
"
2,18,Stan,"What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
"
1,7,Wendy,"Aaahh.
"
9,6,Kyle,"Do any of you guys have milk money I can borrow?
"
15,4,Stan,"You just did that to everybody in class!
"
10,3,Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!!  It's wrong! 
"
13,1,Kyle,"We've had just about enough, dude! You've been blowing us off for two weeks now! What's up?!
"
14,14,Randy,"Daddy time. It's Daddy TV time. 
"
10,1,Kyle,"Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. 
"
18,7,Butters,"AAAAAAHAHAH! 
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh I know.
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, you've had enough! Just stop now!
"
7,8,Stan,"Well, what can we do about it?
"
13,7,Butters,"Whoa.
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"We will always remember the way that Gordon bravely read the announcements every morning, led us in the Pledge of Allegiance, m'kay, and touched many kids' lives here at the school. And even now that we know the shooter had him confused with a forty-year-old truck driver who happened to have a similar name, I know this has been ...pretty traumatizing, m'kay. But now we must decide who will pick up up where little Gordon left off. Who will take his place reading the morning announcements? It's a big responsibility, because it will be your voice the entire school listens to, m'kay? And although Gordon Stoltski can never be replaced, m'kay, there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to... have his or her voice heard every morning.
"
3,1,Mr. Garrison,"Kenny McCormick, you speak when you're spoken to!!  Go ahead.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Yeah that's good, but now go ARRRGH!
"
16,13,Stan,"Why does it matter?!
"
5,5,Stan,"But there's nothing we can do. Phillip is doing Shakespeare in Canada now.
"
18,6,Kyle,"This is stupid!
"
15,1,Butters,"The Geniuses...
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah, I was kinda thinking we could go to TGI Friday's.)
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Hello there, children! 
"
4,13,Kyle,"Oh... Okay.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Uh what?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Thank you. 
"
9,10,Wendy,"...I just wanna hold my egg for a couple of minutes.
"
6,8,Cartman,"So? So now I can do this!  Yeess! Yeess, Kyle's money! Mmmm, Kyle's money!
"
5,2,Stan,"When do we want it?
"
9,7,Cartman,"Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I'll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Huh?)
"
7,10,Cartman,"Old people!
"
17,9,Stan,"I didn't even know he was working at the mall, Kyle!
"
8,9,Cartman,"No, you didn't.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Wow! 
"
7,8,Kyle,"No! For not being a metrosexual.
"
1,4,Kyle,"We'll help you look for him after the game Stan.
"
18,5,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell are these police drones doing? We can't protest now?
"
9,10,Kyle,"It was really important for me to get an A, Stan. And Bebe said you were so reckless with your egg, so I made a fake one for you  and kept the original safe with me.
"
8,2,Jimmy,"You f-f f-faked being handicapped to win?!  I should k- ick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater!
"
16,5,Butters,"HAAAAA! 
"
2,17,Stan,"Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!
"
7,12,Randy,"Sharon, did you know this guy Joseph Smith found a new testament to the Bible buried here in America?
"
10,6,Cartman,"I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down.
"
7,8,Stan,"Wow, we look great!
"
6,1,Butters,"Yeah, I don't like shattering fat peoples' dreams. Besides, I'd get grounded.  Oh, Jesus! I'm supposed to be grounded! 
"
7,14,Butters,"Oh well, uh I kinda don't have any money left. Unh, I spent it all on Raisins the last six times.
"
1,11,Wendy,"Stan, didn't you notice how her left arm is longer than the right one?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
"
17,7,Cartman,"That's what this is all about, Craig. We're all trying to get XBox Ones on Black Friday.
"
12,8,Jimmy,"I thought I could go on like before. But after seeing Indiana get raped... After seeing Indiana get raped I know I'll never be the sa-a-ame, the same? The same.  Do you remember that scene with Indiana in the refrigerator?  It didn't make any sense, Stan.
"
3,11,Stan,"Uuh. Thanks.
"
3,7,Cartman,"That, of course, is the voice of my babysitter, Shelly Marsh, who is twelve.
"
8,2,Cartman,"I'm not special? I thought you always said I was special.
"
18,2,Stan,"Hey Wendy, you havin' fun?
"
4,16,Kyle,"Parents. Mom. Dad.
"
6,3,Butters,"I do?? Uh. Oh. I, I mean, yeah-ah I do. Uh. Yeah, the kids at school make fun of me for that.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Kenny! 
"
11,13,Randy,"They can play guitar now?
"
11,8,Kyle,"Dude...
"
5,3,Cartman,"Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!
"
16,10,Cartman,"'Kay, thanks, I... Wait! Hang on a second! What do you mean ""That's all right""! What if I was somebody trying to rape my mom?!
"
10,7,Cartman,"You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake.
"
16,9,Kyle,"This has gone far enough!  How can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us?!
"
7,8,Randy,"What? Son, that's a silly thing to fight about.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Ike, will you do something about Clyde, please?  Very nice, Ike.  All right me hearties! Keep your eyes open for boats to plunder! 
"
11,12,Kyle,"Cartman, what's happened?
"
16,11,Butters,"Stupid! Greedy! Haoles! Kill! Them! All!
"
12,1,Cartman,"No you wouldn't! Look, shouldn't you be serving people drinks or something?! Get outta here!  We're on our way, buddy.  Magic Johnson, here we come.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Butters, I need your help.
"
1,10,Kyle,"See ya.
"
12,8,Butters,"I'm scared, but I know my country needs me.
"
10,10,Cartman,"I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!!
"
14,6,Stan,"It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Alright, kewl.
"
4,7,Stan,"Alright Butters, let's go.  Uh-oh, Cartman's pig.  Sshh, good pig. Good pig. Goood pig. Sshh. Okay.  Come on, we gotta get outta here!  Oh, no!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat?  Okay, let's go.  So how are things, Kyle?
"
14,4,Cartman,"Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast!  Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends!  Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon.  You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why?  Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita.  If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street.  The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger  So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle.
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, I want it quiet!  Now, we're gonna try this again until we get it right! What is six times three?
"
14,9,Kyle,"I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
"
6,4,Butters,"Okay Cartman!
"
3,14,Kyle,"You dick!
"
12,8,Cartman,"Dude!  You know what, Butters? You know what? Forget it. 
"
6,5,Stan,"We've tried everywhere! Butters, are you absolutely sure we can't go to your house??
"
18,9,Kyle,"What the fuck?!
"
1,8,Cartman,"Yeah, Starvin' Marvin.
"
12,6,Randy,"Do they have Internet here?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Dr. Mephesto, I need help.
"
6,15,Stan,"That's Cartman.
"
1,10,Mr. Garrison,"Boy, did we get screwed.
"
3,1,Stan,"Oh.  Aaah! Snake!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Hello, Scott!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! 
"
5,7,Butters,"Ma-a-a-a-a-a alright, man.  O-o-o-o-h, it's sticky.
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Okay, try to get closer!)
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Wow, Mr. Hat. Having a nose job is even better than I thought. There's a whole world of opportunity opening up in front of us.
"
4,9,Randy,"...And I left my family.
"
2,15,Kenny,"(Give me that-!) 
"
12,7,Butters,"Teacher said I can't let go till we're back on the bus!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Yeah. And you know, now that I think about it, third grade wasn't all that great, either.
"
11,5,Stan,"You don't see the missteps in logic with that?  Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information.
"
17,8,Randy,"My friends, the time is almost here. Let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before us.  Commander Marsh. ... They're what? ... They're gonna what?!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Uhhh, just uh ahh not right this second, Mr. Mackey.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Seriously you guys! Tom Saltzman's dad is a drunk driver. He's the one who ran over Joey Potts's dog because Joey Potts doesn't know how to take care of his animals, which is why he gets beat by his mom! 
"
6,16,Jimmy,"Well, I did Ecstasy once.  Me and my girlfriend took it and we stayed up all night having... sex. 
"
2,13,Cartman,"What are you guys doing?
"
2,17,Cartman,"I hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker.
"
4,2,Stan,"Yeah, we just have to get Butters' tooth.
"
8,7,Kyle,"Dude, hold on! This is bullcrap! If they wanna live in our time, then they should learn our language!
"
18,10,Cartman,"No, it's not good, it's fuckin' awesome!
"
3,12,Cartman,"You guys, my hand totally smells like spaghetti now. Smell it. 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Well...you did say free ice cream? 
"
12,10,Cartman,"No! No es bueno! 
"
12,8,Kyle,"I'm... glad... that you guys can just keep living. I don't think I can. 
"
6,6,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
2,8,Kyle,"You bastard!
"
8,9,Kyle,"Yes, I did!
"
13,10,Butters,"Triceratops!
"
3,1,Kyle,"Shut up, fatass!
"
1,9,Cartman,"Bye, Kyle!  Happy Channukah!
"
13,11,Cartman,"Oh, I'm sorry. Am I making things uncomfortable for you Stan? It's your fault me and Kenny are in this mess!
"
6,1,Butters,"Uh- go where?
"
11,6,Stan,"We don't?
"
9,11,Kyle,"Dude, we're gonna go sneak into Cartman's and change him back into a non-ginger!
"
6,13,Butters,"Wuh, okay.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah.
"
15,12,Cartman,"They were your FRIENDS!
"
5,9,Cartman,"Oh no, not Towelie.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Pussy. 
"
5,2,Cartman,"Yeah, we're gonna use him to help raise money in our bake sale.
"
12,11,Cartman,"Yeah, Mr. Complainy Pants! 
"
17,7,Randy,"Get back inside. We have work to do. 
"
3,16,Randy,"Yeah, with our own eyes.
"
17,2,Cartman,"You guys?  You guys, you'd better get over here.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Rgh! Ma'am, the Crack Baby Athletic Association is a storied franchise. It was founded over twelve days ago, with a firm ethical code that strictly states ""benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being."" I cannot offer you or your child any cash. I can however offer you a little bit of crack. Butters? 
"
2,10,Randy,"Doctor?
"
5,4,Cartman,"Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes.
"
7,15,Cartman,"You guys go get Ike. Kenny and I will stay here and watch the fort.
"
7,12,Kyle,"You're having dinenr with his family? What kind of family has a kid like that?
"
13,11,Cartman,"Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whaaales!
"
6,8,Cartman,"I don't know.
"
3,12,Stan,"We're gonna dig up Kyle's dead grandma.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we'd said something about water.
"
11,5,Randy,"You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away.
"
2,12,Randy,"Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.  Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up.
"
6,13,Cartman,"Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. 
"
1,8,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison? Why do poor people always smell like sour milk?
"
1,1,Cartman,"I'm not telling you.
"
15,8,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, well, that's not gonna happen, Debbie. Okay, you know, uh life, life has to change, m'kay?
"
7,14,Stan,"Something I should have done a long time ago. 
"
14,10,Stan,"Where are you?
"
14,4,Stan,"'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends.
"
3,12,Randy,"Lynch mob! 
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"I can't thank you enough for everything, m'kay? I feel like my old self again.
"
14,9,Randy,"People from Jersey?
"
3,14,Cartman,"Gentlemen! I hate to break up the party, but I believe we have a fort to take.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Will you get out of my living room, please?!  Hello?!
"
15,6,Butters,"What??
"
4,2,Kyle,"Cartman, what's going on?!
"
18,10,Kyle,"Comments on commentators, it's all changing so fast.Playing XBox with your brother is... just a thing of the past.
Now with Ma on her iPad, and Dad trending or trying,All the family is scattered, and the living room's dying.
Because it wasn't the outdoors or church or even trips to go ski,
What brought families together most was a good old TV
Now we watch things by ourselves and just tweet what we saw.
And if you try to complain, you get called a-
"
4,13,Cartman,"Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
"
15,6,Butters,"Well yeah ah, I saw you pissing in my face.
"
8,12,Wendy,"What?!
"
6,4,Stan,"We'll stay in this room with these baby cows for as long as it takes! 
"
7,11,Butters,"Oh...  Ma'am, can I use your phone?
"
13,9,Butters,"I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me.  Ow.
"
18,5,Randy,"No. I didn't. 
"
4,13,Stan,"Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!
"
7,1,Stan,"Sirs, uh, if you'll just let-
"
15,10,Stan,"Stop right there, you little rat!
"
7,15,Stan,"What?? But I thought there was one road in Canada.
"
12,14,Butters,"That's Ryan Ellis. Looks like they've gotten to him too.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Why? What's it sound like?
"
10,8,Stan,"We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
"
5,3,Kyle,"Okay. Okay, you're right.  Oh uh Cartman: thanks.  Cartman?  What the hell? 
"
9,2,Cartman,"How much money is enough, Mayor?! How many people's lives it is all worth?! God damned hippy!
"
7,14,Butters,"You guys! I think our Raisins girl likes me. She, she touched my back when she walked away. Did you see that?
"
14,14,Stan,"Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! 
"
4,1,Cartman,"We're gonna make it, Kenny! We're gonna make it to Mexico!  Oh, God dammit! 
"
15,9,Cartman,"You guys were putting out fliers, I had to put some out too.
"
10,14,Stan,"I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day.
"
6,12,Stan,Kenny! Lolly's Candy Land is giving away a shopping spree!
17,8,Cartman,"Why don't you stay the fuck out of my business?!
"
17,8,Butters,"Let's just talk to this guy, and then we can hit a McDonald's. Oh here we go. 2217. 
"
5,13,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you doing with aborted fetuses?!
"
10,3,Kyle,"No!  I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!
"
5,10,Butters,"I sure am, Dad!
"
3,2,Stan,"Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?
"
8,5,Butters,"No, he's not smart! He's just an asshole. And he's never gonna play on me ever again! 
"
5,1,Cartman,"Whoa, dude, it's raining frogs.
"
6,16,Randy,"Okay, we've had enough!
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Hehyayaya hehyayaya!)
"
10,8,Stan,"Dude! We've been waiting forever!
"
1,9,Cartman,"Oohhhh!
"
7,13,Kyle,"Yeah dude, don't get us killed too. 
"
17,1,Cartman,"Dude, I really can't hear you Lawrence. Are you outside or something?
"
8,1,Cartman,"No, Butters. We are a very select elite fighting team sent to protect the world from evil, and you can't play with us.
"
15,6,Butters,"Well goodnight for now.  Goodnight, Butters.
"
10,10,Kyle,"Would you excuse us for a second?  You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! Stop right there, Ike!  Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Sister, have you read this book?
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
"
7,3,Mr. Mackey,"Welcome to detention. You will be here till five o'clock, so make good study use of your time. M'kay?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Thanks, Mr. Stallone. We're just sorry she wasn't a better boxer. 
"
15,7,Cartman,"What'd I get what'd I get what'd I get?
"
6,16,Butters,"I don't think we're supposed to go in there, Stan. Maybe we should go adventurin' somewhere else.
"
8,2,Cartman,"All right, this one I can win!  Here, hold this!  I'll show you Goddamned retards! 
"
4,8,Wendy,"Because I don't know what to do. I can't concentrate, and if I can't concentrate, then I can't win the debate tomorrow. The whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-
"
7,14,Kyle,"What happened? Aren't you still wallowing in pain?
"
11,12,Kyle,"Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!
"
13,11,Stan,"Oh no, no, NO.
"
8,1,Butters,"Hey fellas. What's happenin'?
"
4,1,Cartman,"Oh, thank God! Oh, thank you, Jesus, uh! Hoh.  Here you go, God-damnit!
"
12,14,Cartman,"Butters?  Butters?! 
"
10,2,Cartman,"We have to get out of here! Now!  Kyle! Kyle!! 
"
3,10,Kyle,"Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon.
"
13,4,Cartman,"Dude! What the hell is this disgusting crap?!
"
10,4,Kyle,"Thanks, kid.
"
9,13,Butters,"Look! The Mexican border!
"
9,6,Butters,"Did you ever do anything really bad?
"
14,5,Cartman,"You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! 
"
1,1,Stan,"What? How do you know she has a cat? 
"
8,14,Cartman,"I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. 
"
5,2,Jimmy,"And so I said to him, ""Hey, I- I may be handicapped, bu-but I'm not... deaf.""  Wow, what a terrific audience. Well, for my next joke I'm gonna need a vo-volunteer from the audience, very much. How about you, Timmy?
"
9,14,Stan,"No, cancer is a disease. My dad needs to drink less.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Oops, busted. 
"
8,8,Butters,"Ohhh, we lost?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Hey, so um, as I'm going through people's e-mails and phone calls, um, how do I know which people to start with?
"
8,10,Butters,"Is it true?! Trent Boyett is getting out?!
"
2,9,Kyle,"In a sewer?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh.  You're right, Mr. Slave. We can both kill them together.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Come on, Jack, you gotta be able to offer me more than that. ...Yes, I realize there's a ban on stem-cell research, but I've got thirty-some-odd human fetuses in my backyard! I'm sure there's other research your company can do with them. ...You'll take one? Okay, how much for one? ...Aw, Jack, you're breaking my balls here, Jack.
Yes, hello, is this Captain Bly's Seafood Restaurant? ...Yeah, hi, I've got a shipment of about thrity-one of the most succulent shrimp from the West Indies. ...These are killer shrimp, Gary, your customers are gonna love 'em. ...What kind of price you payin' for shrimp? ...Oh, Gary, you're breakin' my balls, Gary. How about ten and a quarter? ...Balls, Gary. Breakin' 'em. ...Alright, I'll call you back. 
"
2,6,Kyle,"F-minus? Can he do that?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"This is gonna be t-terrific!
"
12,12,Randy,"Yyeeaahh!!!! Yeah Obama! Chaaange! It's, it's chaaange!
"
14,14,Randy,"Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and...  Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!
"
6,9,Stan,"Tweek is right. It isn't fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different! Movies are art, and art shouldn't be modified!
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Ey, guess what everybody?! I'M GAY!!! 
"
4,3,Kyle,"It's Kenny's singing!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"No, your shoes say you take it in the butt!!
"
12,5,Cartman,"Now you sound like white people!
"
6,4,Stan,"They don't belong to anybody! Please Mom, we don't want these calves to die.
"
4,11,Cartman,"I am saying this because we must be saved-uh. The Lord is powerful and he will smote the sinners and send them to everlasting hell-uh. If you do not live your life for Him-uh, then to the lake of fire you shall go-uh! 
"
8,9,Kyle,"He is working for the Wall-Mart to stop us from succeeding!
"
8,1,Stan,"All right, then you take him to the hospital, Kyle. You take him to the hospital and let your mom find out what happened.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Well, our friend Marvin and all his people have to live on a part of Earth that sucks ass. They can't grow food or nothin'.
"
7,3,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
15,14,Cartman,"That's right.
"
18,7,Cartman,"See? He's an asshole. Fuck him.
"
7,2,Kyle,"Yeah, this is starting to look like something we shouldn't be any part of. Let's go play with trucks or something. 
"
14,4,Kyle,"Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. ""Hey Kyle, really like your farm."" Oh awesome!  What the hell is that? Stan? 
"
9,2,Cartman,"Navigation systems?
"
10,7,Cartman,"Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?
"
15,12,Cartman,"Wow, Craig. I can't believe you just went there. Here we were having a perfectly nice conversation about Kenny being poor and Kyle being a Jew, and you just decided to go 9/11 and bust out the fat quip.
"
18,2,Cartman,"What the hell is gluten?
"
4,13,Stan,"He is in there.
"
5,5,Kenny,"(Toronto?)
"
2,2,Mr. Garrison,"I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat.
"
1,8,Mr. Garrison,"Noo, that's a Caesarian Section Eric, but that's okay, remember, there are no stupid questions, just stupid people.  A canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who can't afford to eat on Thanksgiving.
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, no, don't try- oh God, here we go.
"
3,5,Cartman,"But the other jakovasaur talked different.
"
14,11,Stan,"Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?
"
18,9,Kyle,"I don't need Ike listening to you comment on anything!
"
11,7,Cartman,"Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house.  Get out of here!
"
5,1,Cartman,"Oh boy, that thing has really got sand in it's vagina! 
"
7,11,Butters,"But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.
"
3,6,Stan,"You would think that, you little ass-sucker.
"
15,13,Kyle,"Oh, come on!!
"
7,6,Cartman,"The torso he would dump into the lake. 
"
9,14,Kyle,"You know, I didn't even get home until 2:30.
"
6,12,Kyle,"I knew Kenny couldn't fit in that tea pot! 
"
1,4,Kyle,"What's the matter dude?
"
4,7,Cartman,"I swear I'm gonna kill you guys!!
"
2,12,Kyle,"Hoh boy.  Sick!  Aggghhh! Fucking sickening! 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Butters!  Butters, Goddamnit, I need your help!
"
14,2,Cartman,"Aww, books? God, I hate those!
"
3,8,Stan,"Mom!
"
16,11,Cartman,"You'll never guess what happened. Butters just beat up Scott Malkinson!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Eey! Freline furton! Sucky-sucky!
"
12,12,Randy,"Obama's not talkin' about you!
"
8,6,Cartman,"Oh, son of a bitch! I knew it! What the hell are you doing, Stan?! I'll tell you what you're doing! You're trying to steal MY best friend!
"
15,8,Cartman,"That's right, it's a butt fungus.
"
9,9,Butters,"You mean it?
"
2,18,Kyle,"Okay. First one to die, loses.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Yeah, I think the same thing.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Alright, that does it, Cartman! That's my grandma! You show her some God-damned respect!
"
8,11,Cartman,"I can't lose this extracurricular credit. I need it to pass fourth grade!
"
16,13,Stan,"Dude, where are people getting all the brown wristbands?
"
15,5,Kyle,"Oh it's, it's so sad.
"
11,1,Randy,"No.  No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Mom! Answer the door!
"
2,9,Stan,"Calm down, tubby.
"
9,7,Cartman,"D'you know what you are? You're all a bunch of fucking cock roaches! You need people like me! You need people like me so you can point your fucking finger and say ""That's the bad guy!"" Well say goodnight to the bad guy!!
"
10,12,Kyle,"No.
"
5,11,Stan,"Yeah, as soon as we get to the concourse you'll see how fun it is.
"
7,10,Kyle,"You insensitive asshole, Cartman! Nine people died!
"
1,7,Kyle,"Wookies don't live on Endor!
"
12,12,Randy,"It's okay, Stan, everything's changed. I don't need this stupid fuckin' job anymore! You lil fucking assfuck, piece of shit  You know what Obama said? Yes we can!
"
4,2,Cartman,"Heh, you can compound daily my ass with interest, Mom; I'm goin' to the toy store and buy me a skateboard! 
"
12,9,Butters,"Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school! Hey everybody!  Wendy and Eric are fightin' after school!
"
12,7,Cartman,"All right Butters, I've seriously had enough!  Jesus Christ!  One please.
"
9,13,Stan,"All right. In order to make our plan work, we're going to need the pool from Clyde's back yard, Timmy's wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.
"
15,7,Kyle,"No. And I don't want to. Look Stan, maybe we should fo- 
"
5,1,Kyle,"I am not full of meecro- what? Look, the word ""shit"" first showed up in English in the 1340s, the same time as something called, ""The Black Death"".
"
3,2,Randy,"Hm. Really?
"
11,14,Kyle,"Ahahah!
"
14,14,Kenny,"(Yeah, it's really good.)
"
17,9,Jimmy,"Yeah that's that's that's pretty nice. 
"
8,7,Cartman,"Hey! Don't boss me around, you fuckin' Jew! I will kick your ass!
"
15,9,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Well you're a fuckin' Jew Kyle! And now you're a Mexican Jew! You dirty, no good... Mexijew!  Let's just see you try and-!
"
4,9,Kenny,"(Me too.)
"
3,17,Kyle,"Oh, brother, here we go again. Cartman, there is not a sound frequency that makes people crap their pants!
"
3,1,Cartman,"Eh-heheh!
"
17,9,Randy,"Not one more good person dies on my watch! 
"
6,1,Butters,"Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Bingo! Rich people don't want to live in South Park if they think it's HAUNTED!
"
7,3,Butters,"Well I'm just a little asshole, is what I am. When God made me, he must have not been payin' very close attention, 'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!
"
8,12,Wendy,"It seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted, while intellectualism is looked down upon.
"
11,10,Kyle,"Get out of here, Cartman, we're eating dinner!
"
7,11,Cartman,"I, I don't know, I, have to do some calculations.  10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3. Oh Jesus.
"
2,2,Mr. Garrison,"Then who was it?
"
16,5,Butters,"Um, I don't think I'm tough... grandma.
"
2,18,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
10,3,Kyle,"All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!
"
17,2,Randy,"Okay, I'll wake you up if we get our murder porn back.
"
13,3,Cartman,"Did somebody say ""catch a Jew""? The person you're after might be hard to get, but I can bring him to you. And all I want in return... is Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for handheld Nintendo DS.
"
1,4,Stan,"Isn't there anybody who can help me? Isn't there anybody who cares?
"
11,11,Kyle,"Just get to it already!
"
13,6,Randy,"We know!
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Your aunt Rosie O'Donnell is coming here?
"
3,11,Kenny,"(Hey, you guys, I'm a little bit be-)  (Oof.)
"
13,11,Cartman,"Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Can't read my, can't read my, 
No he can't read my poker face. 
She's got to love nobody. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh. 
Papapa poker face papa poker face. 
Mumumumuh.
"
4,16,Stan,"If we tell you, will you help us stop Fatass?
"
2,4,Cartman,"No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!
"
4,8,Cartman,"It's okay, I'm here.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Yeah! Wait-what?
"
3,10,Randy,"I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all.
"
2,10,Kenny,"(Waa-choo!)
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"And the presentation will be on national television.
"
3,16,Kyle,"You guys! I got my period, too!
"
16,4,Cartman,"I can try to catch it, but I'm going to need all the resources you've got. If this thing isn't contained, your Easter Egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath. 
"
6,16,Butters,"Oh Geez, ah, I'm gonna get it now
"
8,3,Cartman,"Yes, and then we can begin the cleansing, if you know what I mean.
"
17,10,Cartman,"You guys, come on. That's not kewl. You shouldn't rip on her because she's fat. You should rip on her 'cause she's ugly. Okay? She looks like someone hit her in the face with a hot shovel, and that's why she sucks, alright?
"
11,8,Kyle,"Who cares about saying whatever you-?
"
10,12,Kenny,"(What?)
"
11,5,Stan,"Hi Grandpa.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell is going on?! Why did they replace Phillip?
"
15,14,Cartman,"Oh my God... If we found this out it's only a matter of time before everybody else does.
"
13,10,Kenny,"(Mhm.)
"
13,13,Mr. Mackey,"I said take a hike!
"
15,7,Randy,"It doesn't sound like crap at all! I think it's awesome! 
"
10,11,Stan,"Dad! Dad!
"
12,11,Kenny,"(Hey, look out!) 
"
2,15,Stan,"Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!
"
13,7,Cartman,"Okay, anyways. Now enough small talk, lads! It's time for us to start rapin' and plunderin'!
"
9,6,Cartman,"She's gonna close soon! Come on! 
"
5,6,Stan,"Yeah, awesome!
"
9,2,Cartman,"God damn hippie! 
"
5,3,Stan,"So you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions, you guys are all actually friends?
"
10,2,Stan,"Come on, people. Come on, people now.
"
2,5,Kyle,"Uhhhh... Yeah. 
"
1,8,Kyle,"Okay, okay, wewe'll switch off. Starvin' Marvin can stay here for a week, then at Stan's, then with me.
"
8,9,Kyle,"We want to talk to who's in charge.
"
14,1,Kyle,"What?
"
18,9,Cartman,"Looks like we're in the school now. Check out Wendy, she's flat as a pancake.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Oh, uh that's pretty cool.
"
12,3,Butters,"Yeah, he needs some sleepy night-night, doesn't he, buddy?
"
1,3,Cartman,"Screw you guys! … Go to Hell!
"
9,3,Stan,"It's genius.
"
2,18,Kyle,"You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!
"
12,2,Kyle,"Be a good boy? You know all about this?
"
4,7,Stan,"Okay, it's clear.  Okay. Me and Butters are gonna go up and take Cartman's kidney out of him. Kenny, you stay here and guard his mom's door here with Timmy.
"
13,12,Stan,"...And that, Mister Editor, is why they are the true definition of fags.
"
6,11,Randy,"Staaan. Your name... is Staaan!
"
7,3,Stan,"Wugh! Two weeks of this!
"
4,4,Mr. Mackey,"I think maybe Timmy is suffering from something called, ""Attention Deficit Disorder,"" or ADD. It's very common in kids his age.
"
7,1,Kyle,"You're lying!
"
1,7,Stan,"Don't worry babe. Everything's going to be okay.
"
4,14,Mr. Mackey,"Every year the fourth graders do ""The Miracle Worker,"" and every year I have to sit and watch it.
"
9,13,Cartman,"Kyle, Kyle. Let it go, man.
"
11,9,Randy,"No... Nooo...
"
8,6,Stan,"Okay, fine, we'll all stay here, but we're going to sleep now!
"
18,5,Stan,"Sup? 
"
4,9,Kyle,"It's Stan! 
"
3,17,Cartman,"Aaaa-
"
13,14,Stan,"This is more math than I've ever seen you do.
"
5,13,Butters,"Oh, ah, well, he knew you'd say that, so, he told me to tell you that you don't wanna miss this.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Hey, here comes Stan.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Ah, Mr. Hankey?
"
9,2,Cartman,"Yes.  Kyle doesn't get to have one! Ever! And he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous!
"
14,7,Butters,"Towelie! We aren't the only ones in this intervention who've been hurt by you!
"
3,1,Stan,"Oh.
"
7,9,Cartman,"No! Butters, you can't look happy on the album cover! That's not cool!
"
7,4,Cartman,"But, I need to talk to the Founding Fathers to do my report.
"
6,4,Stan,"Cartman, wake up!
"
1,6,Mr. Garrison,"That's right children. Are there any questions?  Yes, Stanley?
"
6,15,Kyle,"You're just jealous he's a better psychic than you.
"
10,2,Stan,"Kyle!
"
6,16,Stan,"Yeah, I gotta admit. You really came through. Thank you. I thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby.
"
12,11,Cartman,"What is it?
"
6,15,Stan,"Here. Look, Kyle. I found tons of testimonials on the Internet saying that John Edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show. And, he pays actors to be plants in the audience.
"
3,6,Cartman,"Yes, that was it. I was suh-so upset.  I couldn't concentrate the rest of the day. And the way his eyes kept looking at me, slowly going up and down my body, like he was undressing me with his eyes. 
"
7,1,Stan,"We wanted to see an alien planet or something.
"
18,5,Butters,"Yes, it's me.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmmih! 
"
14,2,Stan,"Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. 
"
9,6,Butters,"Really?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Ey! Aaah! Uh-ow! Ah! 
"
9,9,Stan,"Come on, Butters.
"
3,2,Kyle,"I just want a nurection so I can give it to my mom.
"
16,11,Kenny,"The American government finally gave in to the natives and had the Mahalo Rewards cards reinstated. Our two cultures, it appears, will once again live in peace.
"
1,8,Stan,"Damn.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Well we're supposed to shoot your commercial today, you fat piece of crap!
"
4,12,Timmy,"Aa-aa-ah!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!
"
5,5,Kyle,"Ih-it'll be okay.
"
5,13,Stan,"And what are we supposed to do, huh?! Stand in that room and keep making small talk?! Make believe like everything's okay?! I CAN'T DO IT!
"
3,8,Randy,"Oh, I feel so much better! Wow!
"
15,7,Randy,"Sharon, come on. Don't you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap?
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Okay. Now, children, has that marijawana made it around yet?  Uhh, who-who has the marijawana now?  Ummm okay, whoe-whoever has the marijawana, just pass it up to the front row, m'kay?  Uh-oh.
"
5,12,Stan,"DVD? We don't own a DVD player.
"
4,16,Stan,"Well, of course your parents said you can't go!
"
1,12,Cartman,"No, I did, Pip.
"
4,8,Cartman,"I warn you, Bog Monster! Do not mock Captain Candycone! O yeah?! How would you like I should kick you in the nuts?!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Oh. I can't take these. 
"
2,12,Stan,"What?! Why?
"
6,17,Cartman,"Now I'm never gonna get my Haibo robot doll!
"
1,1,Stan,"I wonder what that thing was that the visitors gave the cows.
"
7,8,Kenny,"(Woohoo!!)
"
1,7,Stan,"Wendy?
"
16,4,Butters,"Lu lu lu, lu... N-no such thing as J-Jewpacabra. People made it up.  It's -- that's okay. Even if there was a J-Jewpacabra it couldn't get in my r-room anyways.
"
14,14,Randy,"Awwwgh. Oh fuck yeah. 
"
12,6,Stan,"Dad, you've gotta do something! She's out of control!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Come on.
"
14,4,Wendy,"""I think you look cute in your bunny costume.""
"
8,3,Kyle,"You were right. 
"
7,13,Cartman,"Got it! 
"
2,15,Stan,"Damn it! 
"
4,16,Kyle,"Well, thanks for everything, you guys. You really helped us see how important parents are.
"
7,12,Stan,"Oh, stop it!  That's another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin' nice all the time?! It isn't normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!
"
9,12,Stan,"Well fine! Go ahead and sue me!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"So now, can you please change your network's programming?
"
3,9,Kyle,"It is not stupid, Kenny! This is my faith and you shouldn't make fun of it!
"
3,14,Kyle,"Well, as Abraham Lincoln, I accept your surrender, and agree to your conditions. You and all the Confederates will have all the S'more Schnapps you can drink for a year.
"
9,11,Stan,"Dude, what's the big deal?
"
9,6,Stan,"Cartman?
"
12,9,Cartman,"I'm committed to peace, Wendy.  I want you to see just how humbled I am... 
"
13,9,Butters,"Uh, how come?
"
5,2,Stan,"You were right, Dad. Scouts is awesome!
"
2,15,Cartman,"Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here.
"
5,10,Mr. Mackey,"It's possible, hm'kay?  But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, ""Friends"" . Ohokahay, huhuh.
"
2,11,Stan,"Yeah, I guess so. 
"
8,10,Kyle,"Code 7! Bring in the firemen!
"
4,4,Kyle,"No way! 
"
4,9,Kenny,"(Uff--!) 
"
3,1,Stan,"Nooo-ho! 
"
1,1,Kyle,"But I have to get off!
"
16,5,Stan,"Yeah, and Butters is the star! The movie company wants to do a photo shoot with him so we can make movie posters!
"
17,8,Cartman,"I guarantee you Kenny had something to do with Sony offering a Brack Friday Bunduru!  Just keep them in training, Sir Kyle. Two can play at Kenny's backstabbing game. 
"
2,8,Cartman,"Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na.
"
5,11,Kyle,"I mean, yeyou people are all just such hick jock rednecks; it's just like you right out of a stereotyped catalog.  Ah I can't take it. See ya. 
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Thank you. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"Look at it. Look at it, mother. See how the light reflects the spearmint green from its surface.
"
4,3,Kyle,"What's a ""quin-tuplet""?
"
6,9,Cartman,"It's a cool island song.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Sure.
"
3,16,Stan,"But what happens if there's someone who never went through puberty.
"
4,11,Cartman,"We are gonna save you and you are gonna walk with the Lord-uh!
"
3,2,Kyle,"This is gonna be fun.
"
17,7,Randy,"So you worked here last winter? You worked on Black Friday? 
"
14,3,Randy,"What do we want?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Everything looks good, Butters. You're doing great. Let's get to work.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Nice, I like that.
"
13,13,Cartman,"You didn't read the rest, dude.
"
6,7,Cartman,"You go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad! Get at least five gallons of them here stat! Stan and Kyle, you go find a bigger fish tank to them all in.
"
6,4,Stan,"Be strong, Butters. You knew it would come to this.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"So where did that money go? I'll tell you where it went: it went into the pockets of the presidents and CEOs of the airlines, so they can keep their multimillion dollar salaries!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!
"
8,1,Stan,"Dude, shut up!
"
5,13,Cartman,"Look, I can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now, Jill.
"
4,12,Kyle,"Oh yeah, time travel.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Come on, Kenny. You have to get in the circle.
"
18,6,Stan,"So there's nothing spiritually wrong with me?
"
10,3,Kyle,"Okay you guys, check it out. 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Es ist Zeit für Rache!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Kyle! 
"
7,14,Stan,"Butters?
"
11,14,Butters,"O-kay!
"
2,16,Stan,"I really like that guy.
"
12,14,Cartman,"U-hohhh dude, I wish I had a real flamethrower. It works awesome on Japs.
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh. Double hamburgers.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Come on!
"
7,7,Stan,"A winning streak??!! You played one game!!!!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Heeyy, that's Starvin' Marvin.
"
1,7,Cartman,"What are you supposed to be Stan, Howdy Doody?
"
7,9,Kyle,"Really?
"
5,6,Kyle,"No! I finally do understand! There is no justice! There is no God! Do you hear me?! I renounce my faith!!
"
16,2,Kyle,"That's the chemical equation for gold?
"
8,12,Butters,"Oh, well, uh, my sort-of-girlfriend dressed me up like this.
"
15,11,Randy,"I've studied musicals! I've seen them all! I could do this!  Let's bro down! 
"
2,2,Stan,"Could you pull over so I can get out?
"
2,9,Cartman,"No. 
"
17,9,Cartman,"Kenny-chan, please come home at once. Our two houses have found peace. Come to the Red Robin wedding, and we will accept you as the princess you are. Yours truly, the Wizard King.
"
12,11,Kyle,"That's right!
"
3,12,Kyle,"God-damnit! Now, what the hell are we gonna do?!
"
5,12,Stan,"Yeah, like we rip on Kyle for being a Jew.
"
2,17,Stan,"Underpants?
"
7,1,Kyle,"And afterwards, he'll probably have to burn his hand and bury it.
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Just two so far: me and Alec Baldwin.
"
4,7,Stan,"He's fakin'!
"
11,8,Kyle,"L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun.
"
16,12,Kyle,"Dude, you can't do this! How can we be the Avengers without Captain America?
"
9,10,Stan,"So, what are you and Wendy doing?
"
2,13,Cartman,"How much?
"
6,16,Stan,"Dude, I didn't know there was such a thing. 
"
4,14,Cartman,"No! If we want our play to be better than the kindergartners' play, we have to rehearse as much as possible! Now let's continue the scene!
"
2,3,Cartman,"Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?! 
"
11,13,Kyle,"Goddammit! God dammit! 
"
11,13,Stan,"...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Let's punch this baby.  We're coming up on the outer perimeter of the hippies. Hang on.  Reaching hippie crowd. Hull status?
"
9,13,Kyle,"I need to book one trip to the moon, please. Right away.
"
15,7,Randy,"Anybody could play it. Do you really think so?
"
13,12,Butters,"I'm not a fag yet, sirruh but a but I am bike-c-curious.
"
13,12,Kyle,"Yeah. I think maybe everything is gonna be okay now.
"
10,6,Kyle,"Come on come on! Pull!
"
12,12,Kyle,"He was a McCain supporter.  It's okay, Ike. Obama will do fine.
"
11,13,Randy,"I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?
"
4,8,Cartman,"Whoa.
"
9,13,Stan,"Why don't you just tell the people here at the sea park?
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, and what do you consider normal?!
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Uh huh, pile driver position. Good, Quaid.
"
3,14,Stan,"There, you see? We take the s'more schnapps, and by morning they're all gonna wanna go home.
"
6,8,Cartman,"O-hoo, what's that, Kyle?
"
11,9,Randy,"Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!
"
1,2,Stan,"We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy.
"
9,1,Stan,"Yeah, that's basically it.
"
15,4,Mr. Mackey,"You're right. They, they really seem into it, m'kay. 
"
3,3,Kyle,"You bastard!
"
4,9,Butters,"Ah, I can do it again.
"
15,13,Kyle,"Wow, awesome. Um...
"
13,11,Cartman,"Kenny!  I deserve to be on TV.
"
2,2,Kyle,"Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad.
"
18,5,Kyle,"Is, is this? Do you think this is cool?
"
9,9,Cartman,"Remember Butters, you must get that future-telling device from the girls at all costs! And just roll with it if they start lezzing out.
"
6,13,Randy,"Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home.  Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Suck my balls, Kyle. 
"
3,8,Randy,"I didn't say that. I mean, I don't know, I... I just feel so strange. I know it's ridiculous, but I can't help feeling like people here know. You know? Like, even though nobody could know, 'cause we said we'd never tell anybody.
"
3,10,Kyle,"Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass.
"
8,11,Stan,"I guess we'll just take all of 'em.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Well they should've gotten out of there!
"
4,4,Cartman,"It really takes the edge off, man. You should try it. 
"
9,14,Stan,"No it, it's not. And, y-you can't just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad. He He's kind of, a hypochondriac
"
17,2,Stan,"What, dude?
"
6,16,Butters,"I know what you mean. I hate having my future self around, too.
"
8,8,Jimmy,"Gee, I don't know what to say, fellas. They're both instant classics. But I guess I'll have to go with giant douche, simply because the fact that it's a giant renders it useless, adding a parody slant to the satire.
"
8,14,Kyle,"All right, fine!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!
"
4,2,Kyle,"Alright! Get ready, Timmy.
"
5,7,Mr. Garrison,"Missionary position, good. A little boring, but tried and true. What else?
"
18,7,Kyle,"Fuck you if you're in on this.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Look you guys, all it takes is for one of us to crack, and we all know who the weakest link is!
"
12,14,Cartman,"Dude! 
"
6,12,Stan,"Cremated? What's that?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
"
2,17,Cartman,"Ey, let me have some grounds. 
"
3,17,Kyle,"Awwgh!
"
2,2,Cartman,"Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me.
"
13,13,Cartman,"Oohhhh I get it. You're trying to silence me! You're scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Now walk, Timmih! 
"
6,8,Kyle,"Get the fuck out of here!
"
5,9,Stan,"Kenny?
"
2,17,Mr. Garrison,"They're expecting you to give a big speech on corporate takeovers, and this time it has to last five minutes.
"
16,7,Kyle,"Huh?  Dude, what the fuck?
"
8,14,Stan,"Okay, there. 
"
1,13,Cartman,"Why, thank you, Polly Prissy Pants. How nice of you. 
"
3,8,Randy,"Will you stop it?! I don't... I just...
"
18,6,Stan,"Whoa shit. Uhhh, I have addiction demons and I don't understand them.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Heh you're not going to find him. Not until after Saturday when I go to Casa Bonita. 
"
5,3,Cartman,"Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.
"
3,15,Stan,"to make it spin.
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"You talkin' to me?  Hmm, no, I don't like this one either.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Shhh, you're doing it again!
"
7,13,Kyle,"Go ahead. We don't wanna be in their stupid commercial.
"
2,15,Stan,"What?
"
9,13,Kyle,"Ten million?? Well that's more than the Germans want!
"
4,4,Cartman,"Get off of me, Christina Aguilera! Alright?! Please! Hegh, hegh
"
10,2,Butters,"That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!
"
14,1,Cartman,"Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! 
"
16,3,Cartman,"Okay, cool. I'm gonna go left to right, is that good?
"
12,4,Cartman,"Gayness! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"A meteor. A meteor the size of Wyoming, heading right for earth.
"
16,8,Randy,"That's good, Peyton, but we need to get better.
"
16,9,Kyle,"You've gotta be kidding me!
"
16,5,Stan,"Huh?
"
16,10,Randy,"Yeah I'll bet. 
"
1,3,Cartman,"Heheh. Those guys are totally scared.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
7,4,Cartman,"No, I'm not from here at all. I'm having a flashback.
"
1,10,Kyle,"We can't miss the final apocalyptic battle between Good and Evil!
"
18,8,Stan,"Can you stack his deck with more mana?! Can you stack McNuggets' deck with more mana?!
"
4,16,Kyle,"Hepatitis B?
"
9,4,Cartman,"What?
"
1,1,Cartman,"Uh... Ow! My ass!
"
15,5,Cartman,"I'm volunteering my time, Kyle.
"
13,2,Cartman,"Aha! Kenny! I should have known!  Why do you have a picture of Mysterion in your locker, Kenny?!  Unless you are Mysterion!
"
6,3,Cartman,"They look great on you, Butters. They really do.
"
7,7,Randy,"All right, time to win some money!
"
10,4,Cartman,"I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.
"
1,5,Cartman,"No, you don't gotta get Cartman's pig!  You leave Fluffy out of this!
"
13,10,Cartman,"Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. 
"
2,3,Stan,"Cartman!
"
14,10,Stan,"Are you serious?
"
6,4,Stan,"What do I say??
"
4,10,Kyle,"HAAAAH!
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah, let's just go return them and get our money back.
"
12,8,Stan,"JUST RUN!! 
"
7,13,Stan,"Well, I guess we learned our lesson.
"
4,3,Cartman,"What's going on?
"
4,6,Kyle,"We don't know what you're talking about, lardbutt.
"
2,18,Stan,"Come on! 
"
1,8,Kenny,"(O Oh) 
"
2,7,Cartman,"Oh, yeah.
"
2,16,Cartman,"So, how can Mr. Hankey be here, and in another mall at the same time?
"
1,11,Wendy,"HI, STAN!
"
6,9,Stan,"That's gay. 
"
12,11,Randy,"All right, all right. Here's Sharon and Shelly on the roof of Best Buy. We, we run up here to get off the streets. We found the Stotch family hiding up here also. There's Chris and Linda, and their son Butters.
"
11,12,Kyle,"I am not sucking Cartman's balls!
"
5,9,Kyle,"Um...  Greetings from Canada.  Well boys, it's aboot time we get to our hoose in Canada, isn't it?
"
17,3,Cartman,"Agreed.
"
4,6,Stan,"That seems kind of... weird.
"
10,14,Stan,"No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike!  Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! 
"
7,5,Cartman,"Miss Lopez, come on out here. 
"
8,12,Wendy,"Dad, there's a new store at the mall called ""Stupid Spoiled Whore"" and I'm gonna go there and buy a thong!
"
8,4,Stan,"And so we're putting all the best dancers in South Park together to beat Orange County.
"
12,11,Stan,"And then the guinea pigs killing people.  And then... 
"
8,9,Cartman,"That's not what I said! 
"
13,3,Randy,"There are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person. But the fault lies in all of you!  YOU, who bought that three hundred thousand house when you only had twenty thousand to put down? YOU, who bought that third car, even though only two people in your home drive! It is time to stop pointing fingers!  Finger pointing gets us nowhere, Steve! We have mocked our Economy. And now the Economy has cast its vengeance upon us all!
"
2,14,Cartman,"Goddamn,  I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, ""Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!""
"
7,12,Stan,"...Hello?
"
6,16,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman!
"
10,3,Kyle,"Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
"
7,6,Stan,"Hey, kid, what are you doing?
"
9,3,Kyle,"Can I talk to you?! 
"
4,10,Kenny,"(Hey, dude.)
"
10,2,Stan,"Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
"
17,1,Cartman,"It's not gonna be okay because now I'm a whistleblower, and against my conscience I'm gonna have to hide out in Russiaaaa! 
"
1,5,Cartman,"Be a man Stan.  Just say, ""Hey woman, ye-you shut your mouth and make babies.""
"
5,4,Cartman,"That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!
"
18,7,Butters,"Hey Eric! What'd ya say to the principal for missing first period?  Not that we were doing anything interesting. Right Eric? 
"
11,8,Kyle,"You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"What?
"
18,8,Stan,"Dude, it was so badass! Our guy slaughtered every other fighter there. And now he's moving up to the real hardcore shit.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Two tostadas and mih-um enchilito.
"
14,14,Randy,"The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?
"
4,16,Cartman,"No, dickhole. Four tickets, 28th row, for the Raging Pussies!
"
2,10,Kyle,"Because they're a bunch of assholes.
"
12,2,Stan,"We don't wanna upset her, we just want to tell her that we're sorry.
"
1,4,Stan,"Huh? 
"
12,9,Wendy,"Ew! 
"
15,7,Stan,"Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Come on, Ike! I promise I'll be nice to you from now on!
"
2,2,Cartman,"Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop. 
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"No, not cool! M'kay, she's on suicide watch, Eric! She's given up on life!
"
3,10,Stan,"How's it goin', fat ass?
"
8,8,Butters,"Yeah! ...What's this for? 
"
5,2,Randy,"He got to where he is by being a good scout; maybe we should just leave him alone.
"
5,9,Cartman,"He's not crazy, he's an idiot. I know how to deal with these people. 
"
3,15,Kyle,"with dreidel I shall play.
"
5,14,Butters,"Hm. Dad's going to see a movie. How nice.
"
6,6,Cartman,"But we certainly wanna thank you for coming by.  You know the way out, right? 
"
3,1,Kyle,"Aaaaa! There's a dude here! 
"
2,16,Kyle,"Sick, dude!
"
4,6,Cartman,"That's cool, we can hang out. What do you wanna do first?
"
1,10,Stan,"Damn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Uhh... Dru-drugs are baad.
"
11,9,Randy,"Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.
"
7,13,Mr. Garrison,"Hey Mr. Reiner, why don't you Butt Out! 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"So does that mean we can join the c-c...club?
"
4,14,Timmy,"TIMMAY!
"
5,7,Stan,"From sex??
"
4,17,Kyle,"We got the money, Mr. Hankey. We're gonna make our animated Christmas card.
"
7,4,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, and by the way, children, there's a walkout scheduled today to protest the war in Iraq. So, uh, if you're against the war, run along outside, and if you're for the war, uh, stay here and we'll do math problems. 
"
13,13,Cartman,"Oh God damn it! Son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes!  You sons of bitches! Dances with Smurfs was MY idea! MY IDEA!  You can't just take Dances with Smurfs and call it something else! 
"
8,1,Kyle,"Quick, hide Butters! 
"
6,10,Cartman,"And even though it didn't quite work out, I'm sure you'll find other friends down the road, Kyle. Here's a nice watch for you, and some peanuts. 
"
11,7,Kyle,"I don't want you to jump them, retard!
"
4,9,Cartman,"We'll let you know, Butters.
"
10,9,Stan,"Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Oh! Hey Kyle!  Kyle, hang on a sec. 
"
17,6,Stan,"See? You sound like a dick.
"
15,11,Randy,"Well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext! But us up-and-comers have a voice too!
"
4,16,Butters,"Oh boy, here it comes!
"
4,3,Kyle,"Awwww!
"
10,10,Cartman,"That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways.  Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!
"
16,6,Kyle,"STOP!
"
7,9,Kyle,"Because that's what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we're real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.
"
6,8,Butters,"You mean, like a goldfish?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.
"
15,5,Cartman,"...What?
"
8,11,Kyle,"All right, now everybody take a tablet and a pencil.  and when all the ideas start coming, just write 'em down. We might not remember everything otherwise.
"
10,4,Kyle,"You fat sun of a bitch!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Do you hear that, Stan? It worked! We've shut down the veal industry!  Stan? Stan?? 
"
8,12,Cartman,"Kelly Rutherfordmenskin.
"
1,6,Stan,"My name's not Billy grampa, it's Stan.
"
2,5,Stan,"Okay, what have you got?
"
12,10,Stan,"We... we- we're just kids, you know? We, we were just trying to make some money.
"
1,11,Stan,"But why?
"
17,2,Randy,"Huh.  That's weird.
"
6,8,Stan,"Yeah it does.
"
4,7,Cartman,"""Coming in for attack, Captain."" Pipew, pipipew  Give me the space cruiser, Kenny.
"
2,7,Stan,"Okay, so we can agree that the monster outside can't be Scuzzlebutt, because Scuzzlebutt's nice.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!
"
16,5,Kyle,"Look, this is all getting way too big! Tell the movie studio you aren't selling the video to them.
"
14,4,Stan,"Awgh!  Oh thank God.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Sure, sure.
"
7,7,Randy,"Stanley, listen to me. I have SARS. There's only a ninety-eight percent chance that I will live.
"
4,13,Stan,"Wow, cool!
"
1,9,Stan,"What's in the box, dude?
"
5,1,Kyle,"It's stupid!
"
16,13,Butters,"Who?
"
17,7,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
15,4,Randy,"No. No, that doesn't matter!  Fuck, really?!
"
1,6,Stan,"What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
"
4,11,Kyle,"Yeah. I don't remember him saying anything about this.
"
6,6,Kyle,"But we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend, lame as they were.
"
9,1,Stan,"Kyle went down to play in the basketball game, Mrs. Garrison.
"
9,4,Stan,"Please what?
"
18,9,Kyle,"All I wanted was to play one level of Call of Duty and you know what Ike told me? He said the living room was for old people.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Alright, we made it!
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"Not me! Not me not me not me not me! 
"
8,1,Cartman,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, haaa, ha! Now you are a chicken! Nyanyanyanyanyaaa nya!
"
15,14,Cartman,"Yeah, yeah.
"
14,14,Randy,"I worked all day! I can watch what I want!
"
1,7,Cartman,"Whew! Eh, you stink Kenny.
"
8,4,Stan,"But that isn't the point, Butters!  The point is that this is now! It's on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying ""Haha! I'm better than you!"" is part of life. And if you can't face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you're an old man.
"
3,13,Kyle,"You suck!
"
6,7,Butters,"I've done it, General Disarray. I've watches all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the Simpsons, twice. And I've finally come up with something... tha they have never done! Uh, behold!  This device that I have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead, with two-month-old mayonnaise.  People will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet, delicious cherry, but, instead, they'll get a mouth full of yuckies, and sticky mayonnaise. Hey!  You've never ...seen this on the Simpsons, right?
"
15,7,Stan,"No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears. Please, just listen really close.  You don't hear shit?
"
7,13,Kyle,"What??
"
7,1,Cartman,"How about a taco, that craps ice cream?  Guys?
"
1,12,Stan,"Fine.
"
9,5,Kyle,"Nobody said anything about a post-season.
"
6,14,Cartman,"Ey!
"
7,8,Stan,"You'd better shut up, Craig.
"
14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Okay...
"
10,2,Kyle,"Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do.  Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"...Two hundred bucks.
"
6,16,Stan,"Hey guys.
"
9,11,Stan,"... totally.
"
13,1,Kyle,"Cartman?
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, he just cast Psychogenic Probe. Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!  Sir! Sir!
"
3,16,Randy,"We came all the way to Las Vegas for this?!
"
18,1,Stan,"Good luck with your company, dude.
"
16,7,Butters,"Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren't meant for each other.
"
15,5,Kyle,"Hey Stan. Dude, I want you to have this. It's the twenty bucks I owed you plus thirty dollars interest.
"
6,3,Stan,"What? 
"
4,11,Cartman,"This is a distraction from our work on the church!  Do not think that you can tempt us with toys  and new games  and tidings of powdered doughnut pancake surprise! For it is the afterlife we have concerned ourselves with!  Not the pleasures of this Earth, but salvation in the world aftah!!
"
9,2,Cartman,"Oh Jesus, not you guys?  What happened? Were you bit? Did you eat their brownies? DID YOU EAT THEIR BROWNIES?!
"
18,10,Kyle,"What are you talking about, Stan?
"
9,9,Butters,"Mom? Dad? Uh, it's me, Butters. I'm back. 
"
11,3,Cartman,"Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! 
"
5,9,Cartman,"I told you! Jawas have no heart.
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"Ooh no, Mr. Hat. You are not dragging to another Klan meeting.
"
18,2,Kyle,"Nope! We're gonna have all the pizza you can eat, twenty different cakes, and Lorde is going to play live!
"
2,10,Cartman,"I don't wanna.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Sweet..!  Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!
"
6,13,Butters,"Well, then... then let me go with you.
"
6,10,Kyle,"But that sucks. I don't want something to have that much power over me.
"
7,13,Cartman,"They're going to kill me! 
"
11,5,Stan,"Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?
"
4,14,Kyle,"Hey, look! 
"
16,13,Cartman,"All right, let's do this! Make me believe in something that's bullshit, will you?!  Oh, hold on.  Aah, let's see... that one.  Stupid fraud!  Good riddance to YOU! 
"
11,2,Stan,"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Heh. Wow, that sucks.
"
4,13,Stan,"Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid.
"
16,9,Kyle,"What?
"
18,10,Cartman,"Oh bros, weak!
"
11,13,Stan,"Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?
"
3,16,Cartman,"You did?
"
13,12,Stan,"Yes. Yes, sir, you are total fags. 
"
10,8,Randy,"Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this.  This sword can completely drain his mana.
"
1,2,Kyle,"No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?
"
3,8,Kyle,"Hoh, dude, weak.
"
11,14,Butters,"Come on, let me see!  Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! 
"
10,4,Kyle,"Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air.
"
12,1,Cartman,"What? No. No.  Kyle, no!
"
15,4,Stan,"You made everyone else get measured with witnesses; you have to too.
"
4,2,Stan,"Oh. Uh-I don't know.
"
6,12,Cartman,"...No.  Ey! Euuugh.
"
1,5,Cartman,"Ugh!…Hey! I'll kick your ass! 
"
7,14,Stan,"Yeah.
"
4,8,Wendy,"Phew. I'm sure glad that's over with. 
"
8,3,Cartman,"Tell them I'll be down shortly
"
5,13,Butters,"Right.  Uh hello? Is this Mr. Thompson with Anatomy Research? ...Yes, uh, hello sir. Uh, aah, we have a surplus of unborn fetuses that we think you can use for a ...dissection study. Uh huh, ah, how much do you pay for that? ...You're breaking my balls. ...I said, you're breaking my balls, Mr. Thompson. ...My, my balls.
"
13,9,Butters,"Heey! Mr. Daniels! You get kisses from my bitch Roxy in the alley behind Sizzler. 
"
14,9,Cartman,"Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Four days?? Oh man, I can't wait that long!
"
15,12,Stan,"Yeah.
"
18,3,Cartman,"I don't have a problem, Principal Victoria, the cisgenders have the problem. 
"
15,1,Cartman,"YOU said I had to wait till my birthday to get an iPad! So the one I rubbed in everyone's faces today isn't real and tomorrow everyone's gonna call me a liar. Would you mind loaning me some of your lipstick, Mom? Because I wanna at least look pretty the next time you decide to fuck me!
"
3,16,Stan,"So what are we gonna do for New Year's?
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, hi Timmy. Come on in.  I understand you have somethin' important you wanna talk to me about, m'kay?
"
5,4,Cartman,"What?
"
1,10,Kyle,"Chef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.
"
16,3,Kyle,"Yeah, what do you guys wanna do now?
"
3,8,Butters,"So what's our mission now, huh Bosley? Uh wha what do you want us to do now, I wonder?
"
18,10,Cartman,"Ey! Get out of here, PewDiePie! This is MY holiday special!
"
4,10,Kyle,"We don't? But what if we're wrong?
"
7,14,Butters,"... What? Lexus, what are you saying? Are you saying... you don't want to be together anymore?
"
1,12,Kyle,"Well, that whole experience sure did suck.
"
10,8,Kyle,"Attack! 
"
17,10,Wendy,"Thank you, Mr. Mackey, I will... change.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Yesh, kewl.
"
5,7,Stan,"Why?
"
5,9,Stan,"I think so. 
"
16,10,Cartman,"You'll get your money when you finish doing what I asked you, all right? Now as soon as I lock the door, just give me a few seconds to arm the system, then you break in and try to rape my mom. Okay? You got it?  Hello?
"
12,10,Stan,"So? So I just sat there and watched them for a while and, guess how much money they made selling their crappy CDs?
"
9,13,Kyle,"It belongs with its family!
"
17,1,Cartman,"Bro, you gotta um, e-mail Jack about the rally and see if he'll bring petition forms. 
"
17,8,Butters,"Who's George R. R. Martin?
"
1,13,Cartman,"Hiya, Dad!
"
5,10,Stan,"Hey, you're laughing, Cartman.
"
11,14,Cartman,"All right, Bebe, let's see the list.
"
16,10,Cartman,"What?  Hello?
"
2,14,Kyle,"Yeah. Do you know him?
"
11,2,Butters,"I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast.
"
4,9,Cartman,"No??
"
6,1,Kyle,"It matters, dude. 
"
18,1,Cartman,"It's the greatest startup company name EVER! 
"
1,9,Kyle,"I said go away!  My father said you aren't real.
"
2,9,Cartman,"Jesus, he sure ran that one into the ground.
"
16,8,Butters,"Do you feel warm and compassionate?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Well, neither is Bigfoot, Kyle, but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a Sasquatch.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Sweeet!
"
8,7,Stan,"Uh yeah, I want a double cheeseburger and fries.
"
5,10,Butters,"Another week?  I hate my stupid face.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Jeez, that girl is pissed off.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Hohohooho! Oowwww!
"
14,14,Randy,"Oh, thank God!  Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche??
"
16,13,Stan,"How can we raise awareness?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Digital malcontent now at parameter alpha. Prepare for full graphic interfaces on my mark: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Mark. 
"
4,8,Wendy,"Aaaah!
"
3,11,Stan,"Cool!
"
15,5,Kyle,"It happens to be called poutine in Montreal! 
"
2,13,Stan,"Do you think he can ride the bull?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Come on.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Wow!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! 
"
4,13,Cartman,"Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--
"
9,5,Randy,"Stan's little league game, I'm... I'm not gonna go.
"
6,7,Stan,"...and then we put them back in the tank.
"
13,11,Stan,"Pirates don't worry about the law! You guys said you were badasses!
"
18,8,Randy,"Hey! Oh! Oh thank you!
"
5,9,Cartman,"Uh oh, 5:30, time to pray.  Allah, Allah, m'heh
"
8,9,Stan,"Dad!
"
17,9,Kyle,"You didn't?
"
7,11,Butters,"When do you think uh it'll get here?
"
16,10,Kyle,"Yeah dude, like, full-on. Ike saw everything. It totally makes sense now. My mom's been ordering all kinds of stuff from Amazon lately. Sometimes, sh-she doesn't even remember what she's ordered. She's probably been having sex with the UPS man for a long time.
"
6,10,Stan,"Aaaa-ta.  Aaaa-ta.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Hey fags, what's going on?  Dude, I was on the toilet all night from that chicken. I thought I was gonna die. 
"
4,17,Cartman,"Heheheheh, Chanukah sucks.
"
7,10,Cartman,"Yeah. You take out Country Kitchen Buffet, and old people won't know what to do.
"
13,8,Kyle,"What has Michael Jackson always tried to be?
"
15,14,Cartman,"Oh God, I'm so nervous. These kids all seem kind of mean.
"
2,13,Stan,"Sorry, Officer Buttbaby.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes! It did!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Haaa.
"
7,4,Kyle,"Do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap?
"
12,11,Stan,"It might be a way out, Craig!
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Well. No.
"
1,1,Cartman,"No, Kitty, you can't have any!
"
17,2,Randy,"NO, I can't wait around my house from 6 am to 3 pm all of November!
"
17,2,Butters,"I finally found a ladder and I was able to hoist myself out and there was my dad... frozen in the lake! It was like he had no idea how to swim out of it! Oh God it was so terrible! It was so terrible!
"
11,10,Cartman,"Set off diversion track C! 
"
11,5,Randy,"Oh, we should've seen that coming!
"
2,18,Stan,"Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy.
"
1,11,Stan,"Kenny?  No, explain it to us, Chef.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!
"
3,8,Randy,"Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now.
"
12,9,Wendy,"My... parents said that if I fight-
"
1,7,Kyle,"Hehe. Sissy.
"
9,3,Stan,"Guys! Guys! Guys! Don't you see what we're doing? Jesus... we're not talking about an object here, we're, we're talking about a person. I mean, look at what we've all become. All this violence and anger and, and for what? For control over somebody's life who... w-we're all just trying to leech off of.
"
4,7,Stan,"Careful, Cartman, you might pop your stitches. 
"
7,11,Cartman,"No Butters!! If you come up, you'll get infected too! You best wait for the radiation level to go down. Probably... next week sometime. After Saturday. Ugh...
"
2,16,Kyle,"So?!
"
14,2,Cartman,"Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
"
15,14,Butters,"Yep. To find out who the poorest kid in school is, I actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch.
"
14,10,Kyle,"But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with.
"
7,4,Stan,"How?!
"
9,6,Butters,"Wuh I hate my stupid psychotic brain!
"
16,3,Stan,"Dude, we are on the front page!
"
1,4,Stan,"But it was here. It was all right here. The, there was a techno dance club.
"
4,1,Stan,"We're not gonna make it! 
"
1,1,Cartman,"What the hell are they talking about?
"
3,4,Cartman,"Respect my authoritah! 
"
4,15,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer! 
"
15,13,Kyle,"...Uh oh.
"
13,11,Cartman,"I'm not too busy, Stan.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Yeah, sure. 
"
11,1,Cartman,"No! Dude! No fucking way!  Dude! 
"
15,4,Kyle,"...No, dude, that's not the trailer for Terminator 5, that really happened.
"
15,7,Cartman,"Turn it off dude!
"
12,14,Butters,"Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.
"
6,9,Cartman,"Stop, Tweek! This is not the time for faggocity! 
"
13,1,Kenny,"(I agree. Let's put in this DVD and watch Grey's Anatomy.)
"
7,11,Kyle,"Aw dude, weak.
"
1,1,Kyle,"No, dude, if something happens to him, my parents are gonna blame me.
"
2,18,Kyle,"I don't think so.
"
8,9,Stan,"Where's he?
"
18,7,Butters,"Because I'm grounded. That means no visitors.
"
18,8,Kyle,"McNuggets is scared. He doesn't wanna play.
"
3,10,Cartman,"C'mon.
"
15,2,Cartman,"Oh wow, it's Adam Sandler.
"
5,6,Kyle,"Oh, I'm swell, Stan. I popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into Cartmanland, and it got infected. I really need to go to the bathroom, but if I do, it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out. How are you?
"
4,11,Cartman,"Come on, Timmy, get out of that chair-uh!
"
18,9,Kyle,"THIS is the reason why our living rooms are dying!
"
7,8,Cartman,"He's not our friend. 
"
1,1,Cartman,"Ah, man, I had this crazy nightmare last night.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, whatever!
"
8,10,Stan,"Put it out, put it out! 
"
6,1,Kyle,"We have great news! Our friend has lost forty pounds eating your City Wok food. Here's the before and after photos.
"
2,13,Stan,"Jesus, dude!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Hi Kyle. 
"
1,1,Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is mah pot pie.
"
1,8,Stan,"Hey, who's that fat chick?
"
13,11,Stan,"Would you mind stepping back a little?
"
7,10,Randy,"We're not treating you like children, Dad. All right? Now I think you owe Mr. Police Officer an apology. Who needs to apologize, hm?  Who's the sorry-sorry?
"
11,7,Kyle,"Oh crap. 
"
4,10,Cartman,"What'd we do to Timmy?
"
4,6,Cartman,"Wow, cool!
"
1,11,Stan,"No you're not! I don't think I missed any!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Wait a minute. Fishsticks... Fish. Dicks.  Ohmigod! It's so obvious. How did I never think of it before? 
"
6,3,Butters,"...So? I told you guys before:  I'm not Kenny.
"
3,14,Cartman,"The North still won the Civil War! That means slavery is abolished!
"
10,8,Stan,"I'm in.
"
6,13,Kyle,"Butters, what the hell are you doing?!
"
16,11,Butters,"It's not?!
"
3,2,Kyle,"He didn't do anything. He was always with his new girlfriend.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Anything in the basement, Jimmy?
"
7,12,Kyle,"Come on, dude, somebody needs to wipe that fuckin' smirk off his face!
"
7,6,Kyle,"Awww, shit!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, stop it!! You kids don't even know what you're talking about!! Eric, you're not half-bi!!
"
16,12,Stan,"Oh never mind, I hate him again.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Hey you guys.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Hah! Hey!
"
17,2,Stan,"What?
"
16,12,Randy,"He's a... he's a very... progressive... little boy. Gets it from his mother.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"A present? You got me a p-present?
"
1,13,Cartman,"Really? You can? 
"
2,12,Stan,"Go where?
"
13,5,Butters,"Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! 
"
5,7,Stan,"Whoa, cool! 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Oh, please. Cyborg Bill is so yesterday.
"
7,11,Butters,"I'm rebuilding society. Here, take a look.  This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I'm thinking into a P.F. Chang's or a Bennigan's. And this  is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma'am, I guess we should start repopulatin' the earth, huh?  I'm ready whenever you are.
"
11,1,Randy,"Yeah, they're all rooting for me.
"
2,11,Kyle,"My head still feels funny.
"
5,14,Cartman,"We sure are.
"
11,14,Butters,"They sure don't.
"
11,12,Butters,"Oh yeah? 
"
1,5,Stan,"That's good, that's good dude.  Just calm down.
"
6,4,Stan,"Pst, Cartman.
"
6,1,Stan,"How do you feel, Butters?
"
2,17,Stan,"Hey, he talks!
"
11,10,Kyle,"So... why would one come to America to warn us about a terrorist attack.
"
7,12,Stan,"They're not kooks, they're cool. I mean, how come we never have a night where we don't watch any TV and we just... do stuff together and eat and drink?
"
8,13,Cartman,"No! No, you don't wanna kill me. Please, I'll give you anything you want!
"
4,9,Stan,"Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting.
"
5,10,Cartman,"You will?  Ah.  Oh, ah, thank you for your help.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Oh no, I d- I don't want to be a bother, I uh-
"
1,12,Kyle,"Whoa. Check it out, dude.  It's got little drawings on it.
"
2,15,Stan,"I wanna return a fish.
"
10,10,Kyle,"Huh?
"
8,13,Cartman,"(Hey! Help!) 
"
1,9,Kyle,"Nothing.
"
4,14,Kyle,"What is it, Butters?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Yes! Yes, we can record an album next week! Sure we can write ten songs! We'll start tonight!!  We're gonna be rich!
"
4,9,Randy,"I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, ""No!"" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world.  That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley.  It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. 
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Straight? Bu-uh, Oh what... Jesus, what the hell is goin' on here?!
"
12,9,Cartman,"I'm just trying to engage Wendy in a constructive dialogue about breast cancer awareness, Mr. Garrison.
"
2,5,Cartman,"Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?
"
8,1,Stan,"We can't tell you where we got 'em! It's secret ninja stuff.
"
7,14,Jimmy,"Well, Stan. Do you feel, uhb- better now?
"
8,1,Butters,"Nuh uh! Because my cloak is made of a... titanium alloy that shields me from heat!
"
17,2,Stan,"You have no idea what this is about, do you?! We were using Minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows!
"
5,4,Cartman,"Here's my snout.
"
8,11,Stan,"You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.
"
7,12,Stan,"He's a really nice kid.
"
3,12,Stan,"Kyle, will you stop worrying? God! Now, we'll all be back here tomorrow with our costumes, and then, when the Halloween party gets going, we'll bust out dead Grandma! Let's go! 
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, come on in. Join the party, mkay?  Would you like a meteor mai tai?
"
10,13,Cartman,"Who?
"
5,1,Butters,"Oh, sorry, I can't.  They're gonna say ""shit"" on Cop Drama, and my mom and dad say I have to watch it with them so that I don't take it the wrong way.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Hi, can I speak to Nichole please? It's very important.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Protruding vaginal boner.
"
3,1,Kyle,"Dude! All those choirs are the same. They don't even really sing. They use prerecorded tapes.
"
13,1,Butters,"It's true! Ask anybody in fifth grade. Tammy Warner is a total slut!
"
12,13,Jimmy,"Yeah. Where the hell have you guys ...been?
"
6,13,Kyle,"You can't keep it.
"
4,12,Timmy,"Tih-Timmah? 
"
7,13,Cartman,"Heh, ho-okay. 
"
11,8,Mr. Mackey,"Well all right Eric. Well good luck on Dateline tonight.
"
7,8,Cartman,"Yeah. It's a charcoal-based thing that-
"
8,10,Cartman,"Aaaaaaaah!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby Jones meant when he said, ""This is not a victimless crime""? Anybody?  Children, were you paying attention?!
"
3,8,Randy,"We'll be upstairs if you need anything, Stan.
"
8,12,Butters,"Mom, Dad, I-I love you. Please don't sell me to Paris Hilton.
"
8,1,Stan,"Where'd you get those?
"
15,12,Cartman,"Goodbye, Polly Prissypants. I love you.
"
13,9,Butters,"Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch.
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"And so you see, at this point Euripides knew he could not win the battle.  All right kids, for your homework tonight I want you all to read chapters seven... 
"
16,12,Cartman,"This is fucking ridiculous! We've been planning this Halloween for two months, and Stan has to go and ruin it!
"
3,3,Stan,"We're sorry Chef, we had to do it!
"
8,7,Cartman,"Hel-lo ma'am. We're going around town and offering snow-shoveling service. Would you like your driveway and sidewalk shoveled for eight thousand dollars?
"
1,10,Kyle,"Yeah. We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.
"
16,12,Randy,"Go ahead! All you want, bro! All you want! It was a great idea, but no! Everyone just wants to prove that Rrrandy's gone crazy!  ""Oh don't mind Randy, he's just losing his mind!""  Drrrr! You know what? Fuck you and Emily!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Butters, let go God-damn it!
"
11,13,Kyle,"Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! 
"
4,12,Stan,"...I think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient, Butters.
"
2,6,Mr. Mackey,"Shh! M'kay?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Billy Miller? Seriously??
"
4,9,Kyle,"...Yeah. That's gonna suck.
"
7,12,Stan,"Shut up, Butters!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.
"
14,9,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, what's ""muff cabbage""? 
"
6,2,Kyle,"What do you wanna do now?
"
3,2,Cartman,"What?!
"
4,3,Kenny,"(Damn!)
"
10,3,Kyle,"No!  AAAAH!  AAAAH! 
"
6,9,Cartman,"Alright, you asked for it. I'm afraid you leave us no choice. It's time for Plan B.
"
8,11,Butters,"Gee whiz, there sure is a lot of 'em.
"
6,4,Stan,"I'm gonna lock myself in here with these cows until we have a guarantee of their safety, in writing.
"
13,12,Stan,"Dude, why would we want gay people to get out of town?
"
5,4,Cartman,"I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides.  Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!
"
12,9,Butters,"Almost time. 
"
2,17,Stan,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny.
"
9,10,Stan,"Yeah well, I blew it. Now we're gonna fail and Wendy thinks I'm a total loser.
"
12,7,Cartman,"God damn it!
"
4,3,Randy,"No, Dad, she's dead!
"
3,12,Kenny,"(Yes I am! I've got the costume; it's waiting in the house! Yesterday I got this huge package in the mail, and it was big, okay?) 
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"It, it wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete that?
"
13,14,Kyle,"Dude, why aren't people coming to help us?
"
7,12,Randy,"Oh, did he now?! What are they, religious kooks?!
"
3,13,Stan,"Oh, boy. Sorry, dude, you're on your own. 
"
12,6,Randy,"God, the whole neighborhood's affected. 
"
3,2,Cartman,"Hey, uh I don't wanna be Jesus anymore! Don't leave me here, you guys! ...All right, that does it! Screw you guys, I'm going home!  Okay, I'm getting pissed now!  God!
"
15,7,Stan,"Mom, I'm 10 years old now.
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad?! Dad, what are you doing?!
"
18,5,Stan,"Let me see.
"
2,15,Stan,"Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.
"
8,4,Stan,"Okay, that'll work fine. Listen, there's a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don't get served.
"
15,9,Cartman,"I'm not pouting! I'm just... sensitive to fireman jokes 'cause of 9/11 and uh, uh... fuck you Kyle!
"
5,6,Kyle,"You are up there! 
"
5,4,Kyle,"What's ""pubes""?
"
15,6,Butters,"But sir, i was just handing out coupons for-
"
6,15,Stan,"He seemed better on TV?
"
12,9,Cartman,"No. U-unless you want me to. You want me to have self-respect, then I will.
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.
"
6,11,Randy,"That's it! Remember, son! Rememmmber! 
"
2,12,Cartman,"I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--
"
6,8,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! Look! 
"
10,6,Cartman,"Yes you do! 
"
4,11,Cartman,"Uh-oh.
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"No se preocupe, ¿mbien? El Presidente, estáran aqui. Este evento es muy importante para que la maestra del coro se lo pierda. ¿M-m-mbien? (Don't worry, El Presidente, they'll be here. This is too important for the choir teacher to miss.)
"
7,11,Cartman,"Who's joking? 
"
4,17,Cartman,"You know, first thing in the morning when it just won't come out?
"
4,9,Randy,"Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--
"
6,12,Randy,"Boys, it's really neat that you want to see your old pal Kenny so much but...
"
13,5,Cartman,"Team up? Okay, let's write some jokes together.
"
17,10,Butters,"Oh. Oh like a date? Oh no thanks, Lisa. I really appreciate the offer, but you're too fat for me.
"
8,1,Kyle,"We need some more fur.  I think that's good.
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"I did not want love from a young boy! I like men my own age.  Aah! I mean, I like women! What did I say?-Oh God! I love titties!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Together we are strong! 
"
4,14,Kyle,"Butters told us their play was awesome! 
"
14,9,Stan,"Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Yeahhh!)
"
17,9,Stan,"You completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Damnit! But I wanna hang out with older guys!
"
4,6,Cartman,"NAMBLA?
"
8,1,Kyle,"Our parents won't let us have weapons, dude. 
"
6,7,Kyle,"The sea people from Cartman's side are suicide-bombing the buildings on Tweek's side.
"
4,4,Stan,"See what?
"
3,5,Stan,"Cartman, jakovasaurs are making South Park suck. You have to understand that.
"
12,9,Cartman,"You're all just saying that to make me feel better.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Fine.
"
2,12,Randy,"How do you think I met your mother?
"
17,1,Cartman,"You should have taken me out when you had the chance. Now everyone knows the truth! And everyone's gonna think I'm superkewl!
"
12,5,Butters,"Ow. That hurt my brains.  Oww.
"
2,2,Stan,"Aghh!
"
1,7,Kyle,"I'm gonna make a new costume during recess. I can still win that candy.
"
5,8,Stan,"Alright, we're gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. 
"
11,14,Wendy,"Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here.  We need to remake that list. 
"
2,13,Kenny,"(Nuh uh)
"
10,8,Stan,"Dude, I'm almost dead.
"
16,2,Kyle,"...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?
"
7,7,Randy,"Stanley. Did you have an inward journey with the old man? Did you have a vision??
"
9,8,Stan,"Dad, isn't it possible the flood wasn't caused by global warming? I, I mean, the water was held back by a giant beaver dam, after all.
"
9,11,Kyle,"Dude, check it out. 
"
5,6,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
5,5,Stan,"Man, this sucks!
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles!
"
3,3,Stan,"No! I'm not willing to give up! Chef wouldn't give up on us!
"
4,9,Cartman,"If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! 
"
15,13,Stan,"Who's this?
"
10,12,Butters,"Eric! Erihic!
"
17,2,Randy,"We have a hundred ounces of silver. 
"
12,9,Wendy,"You're gonna  fucking die! 
"
11,2,Kyle,"Except for us.
"
9,8,Randy,"Listen, listen everyone! Nobody can leave this building!
"
5,13,Stan,"But...  I didn't get to see him. Hell I, I didn't get to sssay good-bye.  Did he say anything before he went?
"
7,10,Cartman,"Ooooh, isn't this great you guys? Being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong?
"
1,8,Kyle,"You better watch what you say Cartman! You might be poor and hungry some day.
"
7,1,Stan,"No, wait. We won't tell anybody, if you don't cancel our show!
"
4,3,Cartman,"No way! The bitches from Cirque du Chebleu!
"
1,10,Stan,"What the...&#160;?
"
16,13,Stan,"It's almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Phew.
"
4,2,Stan,"What the hell's wrong with Cartman?!
"
13,13,Cartman,"Soo, you're uuh, trying out to be the morning announcement person as well?
"
7,10,Cartman,"No. But we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply.  Here.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Aha! I knew it was you, Kyle!
"
2,12,Stan,"Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Dude, that kicks ass!
"
13,9,Cartman,"Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.
"
7,12,Randy,"Y-you can call me... Randy.
"
11,2,Cartman,"No no, these guys were just leaving.  weren't you guys?
"
6,13,Stan,"O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"When was that?
"
10,3,Cartman,"Yich. 
"
2,7,Kyle,"Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Marvin... 
"
4,4,Kyle,"You know something? I think that's good. It was wrong to make Timmy a singer.
"
1,6,Kenny,"(I have to go pee.)
"
11,1,Cartman,"Hahaha, now say ""Caroline, don't go into the light!""
"
3,8,Butters,"Wwe ain't got no more missions? Uhwhawhat are we supposed to do? We're Angels. Whawhat do Angels do without a mission?
"
6,9,Stan,"Don't worry, Tweek. It's somewhere safe. Somewhere where... nobody will ever find it.
"
16,8,Butters,"I love you too, ladies. 
"
5,7,Stan,"Dude, Mr. Mackey didn't know anything about anything.
"
3,17,Stan,"We're not rednecks!
"
10,9,Kyle,"Terrible.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, I didn't know this dark alley was taken.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Like find out where Mrs. Streible lives, and go over there, and... TP her house.
"
4,15,Kyle,"Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!
"
5,7,Stan,"Ha! They're your diseases!
"
4,4,Timmy,"Hehaahh!
"
5,5,Kyle,"Hey! Look at that line!  It's way shorter.
"
5,9,Cartman,"God-damnit! 
"
11,10,Butters,"Ah, all right then.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Upstairs! First door to the left!
"
8,4,Stan,"All right, we just need one more person!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Another morning. Waiting for the run-down school bus to take me to the run-down school. But today is the day I finally have the guts to do what I should've done a long time ago.  Nobody notices what I have in my front pocket. A little surprise for them all.  I'm prepared for this, but still I wonder.. Will I have the guts to go through with it? Damn right I will! 
"
14,2,Randy,"Huh?
"
2,15,Cartman,"What?!
"
16,12,Cartman,"The Incredible...
"
18,10,Kyle,"Oh my God, you're right! You're totally right!! EVERYONE! GET A NEW TREND GOING! FAST! #webelieveinyou!
"
5,11,Kyle,"What's this comforter filled with? Um, it isn't filled with down, is it?
"
10,10,Kyle,"Oh God!  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother.  Ike??  What the hell is going on??
"
8,13,Cartman,"Coma... How long?
"
17,7,Jimmy,"Uh besides us, it's the book club and Janice Pinkerton.
"
9,14,Randy,"What wait wait, hold on. I never knew that Alcoholics Anonymous was a religious thing.
"
9,6,Butters,"But I don't want to see you!
"
8,8,Stan,"Puff Daddy?
"
2,15,Stan,"Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! 
"
16,8,Butters,"Hey, whoa! Well I can't believe what I'm hearing!  We've been practicing and gettin' ready for this game, and you fellas just wanna quit?!
"
9,12,Cartman,"HA! Saving money, duhhh! 
"
17,3,Cartman,"This is hopeless. How am I supposed to shoot Token with all these stupid rules?!  Wait a minute. I can't shoot Token,  but I can shoot anyone I want in Florida?
"
14,9,Randy,"There is no support! Every ally America ever had is...  Wait a minute.  Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help.
"
10,10,Cartman,"Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!
"
3,12,Stan,"Hay, you're that band KoRn.
"
15,7,Stan,"It... kind of sounds like shit.
"
12,10,Cartman,"Yeah I saw like three of those bands down in Denver yesterday. All their crappy music sounds the same.
"
17,10,Wendy,"...Are you serious?
"
7,1,Kyle,"And then you said
"
15,8,Stan,"I just want everything to go back to the way it was.
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Oh no, apparently, he thinks he's Charlton Heston.
"
7,4,Stan,"Oh, no, nononono.
"
12,4,Kyle,"Here.  We made ten million theoretical dollars. It's all for you. 
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Kids? Kids, okay, I need to talk to you about a serious matter.  You probably all noticed my orange wristband , mkay? It's to show my solidarity with the people of Belarus.  Mkay, you should know that the Belarusian government is right now trying to-
"
4,12,Stan,"So if Timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow, and if he gets off, the chair blows?
"
5,8,Kyle,"Photon rifle, whatever. 
"
9,10,Stan,"Dude, you should just go be with Wendy and be happy.
"
1,3,Kenny,"(Oh, no!) 
"
15,5,Kyle,"Look, let's just get our money from EA Sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Each time you go into the virtual world it becomes more and more dangerous. Are you absolutely sure you want to do this, Butters?
"
2,12,Kyle,"You bastard!
"
7,11,Butters,"Nnn-how terrible?
"
15,1,Kyle,"So, plug it in.
"
18,7,Cartman,"You forgot your neurons would be torn apart?! Did you also forget that if you die in virtual reality you die in real life, Butters?!
"
6,16,Stan,"Oh, sorry. I thought this was a legitimate business!
"
14,4,Kyle,"Unh, that does it!
"
5,12,Cartman,"All the rest of us have to buy our clothes at J mart! Have you even been inside a J mart, Token?!  I didn't think so! 
"
2,17,Cartman,"What?! 
"
8,4,Butters,"Aaaah!
"
7,10,Randy,"Yes. And now seeing how early they get up, I don't see how anyone can stop them. Wait a minute. You boys! You get up almost as early as they do! You can fight them!
"
17,6,Kyle,"No shit!
"
11,10,Stan,"Yeah! How'd you know?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.
"
5,11,Kyle,"I'm ba-ack!
"
10,3,Cartman,"Are you set?
"
13,4,Butters,"The day they're showin' Part 2 of last week's Terrance and Phillip show!
"
1,13,Cartman,"Kill... you... guys! Kill you guys!!
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Hey everybody, it's on in thirty minutes! 
"
11,12,Kyle,"Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?
"
6,5,Stan,"Alright, here we go.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Aay!  Let's hurry. This costume is hot.
"
3,15,Kyle,"I made you out of clay.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Well, I sure have met a lot of interesting people here in South Park.  H-how about that Eric Cartman kid, huh? ""Goddamnit! God-. No, Kitty, that's my pot pie! Goddamnit! Eh, Goddamnit!"" 
"
12,1,Kyle,"I'm still breaking your Xbox. 
"
5,11,Randy,"Oh, man, it that the IT?
"
14,8,Kyle,"How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
"
3,6,Cartman,"Oh, well, I'll just take that, then.  And what about this? Is this one of your favorites?
"
4,1,Stan,"Alright, guys. It looks like Cartman's not gonna be able to sled with us for another... 13 years, so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on Saturday.
"
2,13,Cartman,"How much is it?
"
13,14,Randy,"What's going on?
"
6,6,Cartman,"Just one more rose, Kyle.
"
8,13,Kyle,"Be sure to take me to the same hospital!
"
18,9,Cartman,"Well, Wendy, I started by talking about people talking about video games, but now I'm branching out into talking about people talking about music and the arts as well.
"
10,2,Cartman,"Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Ngh, and then, and then Wendy said that they were the 99% and I was the 1% and that made me not keeeewl.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Why?!
"
6,12,Kyle,"A ladder to heaven.  We build it, climb up, and get our winning ticket back from that asshole Kenny.
"
14,8,Cartman,"I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?
"
9,6,Cartman,"G'bye Butters. I'm goin' to a better place. Perhaps I'll see you again sometime! Good-bye!! 
"
6,4,Butters,"Huh, me neither.
"
11,7,Cartman,"There's a bunch outside my house too.
"
8,2,Kyle,"They're Olympic games for handicapped people.
"
9,14,Randy,"Cure... cure disease. STAN!!
"
7,5,Kyle,"I can see your lips moving!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Why?
"
5,10,Stan,"Did you go yet?
"
5,2,Randy,"See ya, Mr. Grazier. 
"
12,10,Stan,"Oh Jesus Christ! 
"
12,4,Cartman,"How are we supposed to make money on the Internet?
"
14,8,Cartman,"Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes.
"
3,13,Kyle,"From public school, your house is just a flicker of light.  Don't you want to go out? All you do is... stay in your house and... study
"
4,3,Stan,"Uh, sure, you can all get overtime.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Dude, no way!
"
3,1,Stan,"Dude!
"
2,11,Stan,"...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis.
"
17,3,Cartman,"What?! How am I supposed to get a person to break into my house?!
"
18,2,Randy,"Oh my God, we... we have to get a hold of someone who and get the word out.
"
5,12,Stan,"Yeah, so now you're a pussy. Pussaholic.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Well fuck you, Kyle!! I don't wanna go to your faggy birthday party anyway! I'd much rather hang out at home than have to be around you and your Jew mom for a day!  Kiss my balls, asshole!!!  Dude, I totally didn't mean that, Kyle.  I really really wanna go to Casa Bonita. I'm sorry we had that fight just now. You know, I mean, I said some things, you said some things, but, I think it was good and we-we've moved past it.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Why?
"
5,10,Butters,"Hehyeah?
"
4,9,Cartman,"You don't think we're any good, do you?!
"
2,12,Cartman,"But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!
"
5,3,Butters,"I am prepared.  Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Jelly school?
"
8,6,Stan,"Mr. Jefferson- Awww!  It's 1:30 in the morning!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Do you want to be saved from hell-uh?!
"
11,5,Kyle,"Hi, we'd like to speak to a  Professor Teabag? 
"
14,14,Randy,"Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Well he called me chubby!
"
15,12,Cartman,"What the hell?!  Mom? Mom, my room is...  AAAH!! PETER PANDA!!
"
10,7,Cartman,"Seriously! Ey? Eh... 
"
1,10,Kyle,"Hmmm.
"
17,8,Cartman,"Sir Kyle, I wanted to talk to you about Stan.
"
12,8,Stan,"Wh-why?
"
5,11,Kyle,"Boy it sure is dry out here.
"
16,13,Kenny,"(I told you it was a bad idea.)
"
10,2,Stan,"Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead.
"
7,10,Kyle,"Dude, look!
"
8,9,Stan,"Mom, Dad, when people die, do they always crap their- 
"
7,7,Mr. Garrison,"You had me at ""free blanket."" 
"
18,6,Randy,"Oh, it's just nothing' to you, isn't it?!
"
3,9,Kyle,"Uh, Kenny McHeinenberg.
"
14,5,Kyle,"Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?
"
11,14,Cartman,"Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married.
"
9,11,Cartman,"Ss. Who? Oh him? Oh. No, that was just... Tha-that was about something else, totally unrelated.
"
4,2,Stan,"Dude, where's the money?
"
16,14,Cartman,"Pretty sweet, huh?
"
5,3,Stan,"No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!
"
8,2,Jimmy,"Y-yeess! Grrrr!
"
18,7,Butters,"WHAT?? 
"
5,8,Cartman,"Goddamnit! Can we please... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up.
"
13,1,Stan,"We told you: we aren't working for another studio and there isn't a plan to sabotage your big night.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Dammit! If we're gonna sell our hot Christian album, we have got to get on that stage! 
"
3,8,Stan,"What the hell do you want?!
"
10,3,Randy,"Unh, come on! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Yes. There's nothing but smoldering bodies all around you. Burnt out buildings, and what used to be our town.
"
4,10,Stan,"But our friend Timmy can't really talk. All he can do is say his own name, so he can't really confess his sins. So is he goin' to go to hell?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Hey everybody! Listen up! I've got something to tell Kyle! 
"
6,7,Stan,"Oh, hey Butters.
"
6,9,Cartman,"People aren't that into you, Tweek. They find you kind of annoying. Now, I say you've got one last shot here, and I don't want you to blow it, okay? Does that help take the stress off?
"
8,10,Stan,"We've come to... ask you for help.
"
9,10,Cartman,"What do you want from me?
"
9,1,Stan,"You're the best player at our school, dude. You'll make the team for sure.
"
15,12,Butters,"Hey, you know? Eric is right. Maybe we should form a 99% club.
"
4,14,Stan,"Oh no! 
"
15,2,Cartman,"Or will there be?
"
1,3,Randy,"If we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park, pretty much completely.
"
12,3,Stan,"Dude, we've got a big problem. Cartman says Kenny is really messed up.
"
3,11,Stan,"Well Marvin, it was sure cool seeing you again.
"
10,8,Kyle,"Me too.
"
3,8,Stan,"Because, you stupid Melvins, they have rad food and desserts upstairs! 
"
8,8,Stan,"Okay. 
"
12,6,Randy,"Nooo. Naw come on, leave me alone.
"
8,2,Kyle,"God damn you!
"
16,6,Kyle,"What's the point?
"
6,9,Stan,"Why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies?
"
1,8,Wendy,"Don't you want to help those who are less fortunate?!
"
17,10,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, well Wendy, I'm just tryin' to uh- Oh, bye, jelly school.  Uh, Wendy, I'm just tryin' to make you understand how serious it is when you lash out at other girls.
"
8,10,Stan,"Hey, look. What is Ms. Claridge doing?  Ms. Claridge?
"
11,14,Stan,"Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?
"
13,3,Mr. Garrison,"Oh. 
"
4,8,Stan,"Whoa, dude, I don't see anything wrong with that flag. 
"
8,1,Kyle,"I agree with Cartman!
"
12,8,Cartman,"Oh my God...
"
3,11,Kyle,"Where did that come from??
"
18,3,Stan,"...I don't know where I belong...
"
10,4,Kyle,"Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?
"
12,2,Randy,"Hey Sharon, Britney peed on a ladybug. 
"
4,12,Cartman,"Suck my balls!!!  Oh, God-damnit, you guys, I am so seriously-
"
9,9,Butters,"Huh?
"
6,16,Stan,"How many parents have you exacted revenge upon?!
"
2,12,Stan,"Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.
"
15,9,Stan,"Cartman, stop pouting that you lost the game.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Stan?
"
6,6,Butters,"Not long now, General Disarray, and... our horrible plan will be complete.
"
10,3,Randy,"I like the sand idea.
"
2,3,Kyle,"He's here!
"
16,2,Stan,"A six-layer burrito?
"
1,6,Stan,"We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and...
"
1,6,Kyle,"Yep, all done.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Hey.
"
2,15,Kyle,"Here he comes.
"
15,5,Cartman,"Vunter Slash?
"
18,9,Randy,"Hey uh, listen, I, I thought I could do this, but it's not gonna work.
"
6,2,Randy,"They let you stay for free?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Hey guys, listen!  I finally know how you feel, Kyle. Know your religion is right but being laughed at by everyone else. It's so hard for us Jews. But I guess we just have to let stupid people believe what they are gonna believe.
"
7,1,Stan,"Please, take us to them! Please!
"
8,7,Randy,"We know, Stanley. We've been watching.
"
1,10,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, what a mean thing to do!
"
17,7,Cartman,"Yes. Yes, very nice. Good.
"
1,10,Stan,"Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!
"
14,8,Cartman,"No I can't; I'll always be like this. 
"
15,7,Stan,"I thought you guys were sick! 
"
3,2,Stan,"Dude, he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on.
"
7,4,Cartman,"Maaaa. M-maaaa.
"
1,2,Kyle,"Wow, what did you write about Cartman?
"
9,6,Cartman,"Yes, it's working! 
"
4,10,Stan,"Pamphlet. Pamphlet. 
"
13,8,Kyle,"I don't know. Last night we found him hiding in the kitchen pantry. He was screaming the name ""Billy Mays"" over and over again.
"
11,11,Kyle,"Cartman??
"
14,10,Randy,"I said get me in there!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Dibs!
"
15,8,Butters,"Well I don't want burgers comin' out of my butt!
"
14,4,Kyle,"That's just a guy's penis too!
"
1,2,Cartman,"Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?
"
7,7,Cartman,"Maybe give Kyle AIDS, huh? Lookin' a little better now.
"
1,8,Mr. Garrison,"I don't know Eric, they just do.  Now children, I want each of you to bring in one can of food. And later, the mayor of South Park will divide it up amongst Kenny's family and other poor people.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Radiohead. Yes, of course. 
"
9,8,Stan,"Stop it! Stop it!! First it was terrorists, then George Bush and global warming and now you're all blaming crab people for something that's very simple! It's MY fault. I broke the dam. 
"
13,12,Stan,"But that's a lot of seats? How are you going to pull that off?
"
12,1,Stan,"Oh dude, was that yesterday? We forgot.
"
3,8,Mr. Mackey,"We'll come get you kids when the meteor shower starts. 
"
5,13,Stan,"Mom? That's what hospitals are for. They, they can make him better.
"
14,8,Cartman,"Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck my car.
"
18,1,Kyle,"All right, I really don't want to have to do this, but... I'm not happy with the direction this company is taking.
"
16,3,Stan,"OK, whenever you're ready.
"
15,10,Butters,"Eavesdropper?
"
11,2,Butters,"You're perfectly normal, Bradley.
"
8,4,Stan,"The arcade?
"
8,2,Stan,"So?
"
9,8,Randy,"With all due respect, clichй dissenting Republican, the economy isn't going to matter... the day after tomorrow. 
"
4,6,Stan,"We don't wanna go to some stupid adult meeting anyway!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!
"
4,2,Cartman,"How much?
"
15,5,Kyle,"Dude, what actually makes total sense about it, if you look at it, is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need.  Yeah. It's pretty cool, dude. Because most of these babies would normally not even get out, you know? Huh, or be able to do anything.  Just because we are making money doesn't mean that those babies aren't benefiting. It isn't exploiting them. They're finding a useful place in society. What's so unethical about that? 
"
3,8,Butters,"Come right on in here, Bosley. Huhwell, it was my idea.  Uh I got to thinkin', ""Wuh, where do people keep TV sets?"" and then I remembered that lots of grownups have TV's ih in their bedrooms. So, so I walked into Mr. Mackey's bedroom and er and sure enough, here it was.
"
7,7,Randy,"Stan, we've all tried to raise money, but we only raise ten thousand dollars, and the deadline is tomorrow.
"
10,6,Randy,"Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?
"
3,16,Stan,"Don't you worry about that! I've started taking hormones!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Excuse me, are you talking about... my own special executive bathroom?
"
18,2,Kenny,"(A party?!)
"
2,8,Stan,"Well, I can hardly wait.
"
10,13,Cartman,"I can't wait two months!  I can't! There has to be a way around this!
"
14,5,Cartman,"I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. 
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh yeah?!  I'm not going, Mr. Hat, and that's final!  Let's just see you try and go without me!  Mi-Mr. Hat?
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Well, don't you want to see them?
"
8,12,Butters,"Wa-I'm, Wa-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'd like to be your boyfriend and all, uh even though you have kind of a big nose, but my parents told me, ""never get into a car with a stranger.""
"
16,4,Butters,"You think Jewpacabra is here?
"
14,3,Randy,"Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls. 
"
1,1,Stan,"That was beautiful, dude.
"
5,10,Kyle,"I hate picture day at school! It's always some gay-ass photographer with some gay-ass backdrop of New England!
"
10,7,Kenny,"(Fuck you.)
"
15,1,Stan,"Dude, when the police wanna know where somebody is, they ask Apple! The only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet! Yo guys, we're gonna have to ask help from... the Geniuses.
"
8,3,Stan,"Uh, we saw your movie, The Passion, and we didn't like it, so, can we have our money back, please?
"
3,12,Kyle,"Right. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"Okay, molestered, bad touch.
"
18,3,Butters,"He's not a woman, he's not a man, he is something that you'll never understand. But he would die for me. 
"
11,1,Randy,"I know it but I don't think I should say it.
"
13,9,Stan,"You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!
"
8,5,Butters,"Hey, look over there, AWESOM-O. The film studio commissary.  That's where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh, Hollywood blockbusters have their lunch. Neat-o, huh? 
"
3,11,Kyle,"Let's go somewhere. 
"
3,4,Cartman,"Yeah. He said you eat poop, and that it makes your breath smell like poop, and that, eh, well, you like it.
"
6,17,Cartman,"Well Santa, it's just that... I was thinking about the people in Iraq who are afraid that we might bomb them and I just thought, well, maybe it wouldn't hurt to send them a little bit of our Christmas spirit as well.
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Not much. I just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news. There's a new Terrance & Phillip mobile game, and it's so amazing and incredibly fun.
"
4,10,Cartman,"No, you're already going to hell.
"
10,2,Kyle,"My Dad says he can't live here anymore.
"
2,4,Kyle,"What do you want?!
"
15,8,Stan,"Aughah. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Hey, Chef.
"
2,10,Stan,"And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
"
2,13,Kyle,"You'd better be right, dude.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Weak.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Racist! 
"
18,9,Randy,"Sharon? Sharon!
"
16,9,Cartman,"Oh! You fucking bitch! 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Aw, just forget it! 
"
3,15,Stan,"What's going on? ...Oh, it's that Hanukkah thing.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Go on! Walk the plank, you scurvy dog!
"
12,13,Cartman,"Shut. Up. Shut. Up. Shut. Uuup!
"
12,13,Cartman,"That's a low blow, Stan.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Everybody get in a single-file line!
"
9,3,Stan,"Go Wing! 
"
2,12,Wendy,"Is the clubhouse ready?
"
18,2,Stan,"Sweet!
"
1,5,Kyle,"Oh my God! They cloned a foot. 
"
15,4,Cartman,"Yeah, dude, look at it! It says right there: ""Eric Cartman, 1.2 inches""!  Why would they tell everybody that?! They wanna measure my wiener?! Fine! But don't put me on blast!
"
3,13,Cartman,"You're damn straight, he did.
"
7,13,Stan,"It wasn't the tobacco companies' fault that we smoked. It was our fault, us! We should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do!
"
2,11,Kyle,"I thought it was ""plane-tarium.""
"
12,7,Cartman,"AAAAH! 
"
14,2,Kyle,"Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!
"
3,13,Stan,"You don't wanna be home-schooled, fatass.
"
2,7,Stan,"GAAA-uh.  Ugh. Oh, dude. What a nightmare. 
"
4,17,Kyle,"So how much done is that?
"
2,16,Kyle,"Cool!
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
"
11,14,Stan,"Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Ah- are you sure?
"
9,6,Stan,"Oh boy!  Cartman, you ate the skin off of every piece of chicken!
"
15,5,Kyle,"In our deal with EA Sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names. But we aren't paying the crack babies.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Stop it, Cartman!
"
11,7,Randy,"No, sorry, I don't have any change.
"
8,9,Kyle,"We'd better get out of here. 
"
5,14,Butters,"Little white lies?
"
12,13,Stan,"Says this DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Maury, I am out of control. Yeah, I use drugs. I can do what I waunt, bitch! Yeah I have sex, and I don't use protection! It's my hot body; I'll do what I waunt!  I don't go to school and I kill people! What-evah! I'll do what I waunt!
"
13,10,Stan,"Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked.
"
3,1,Stan,"It's just some dumb activist kids' choir thing.
"
8,12,Wendy,"Because all the other girls are. They're having a huge sex party right now and I'm not invited.
"
3,3,Kyle,"That's it!
"
8,9,Stan,"Come on, we've got to try to make it to the back! 
"
18,1,Kyle,"Yeah, I just... well I just thought our company name would be more like uh... or-original
"
6,5,Kyle,"God-dammit! Come on, we can go watch it at my house!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Awww, sweet!  No way, this is so tits!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Butters!
"
17,1,Kyle,"AAAARGH!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Now, personally, I like the baby green.  But I also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house.
"
15,7,Stan,"Ugh, bunch of people trying to sell us a bunch of shit.
"
15,14,Stan,"Did you hear anything more about what happened?
"
5,6,Cartman,"Eugh. Well, now I can finally get back to my riding my rides!  Uh oh! Oh man, I'm so scared!  AAAGGGHHH....
"
9,3,Stan,"Look, Token, here's the bottom line. You're gonna start having a lot of offers comin' at you from all directions. A media storm is about to hit you and you can't handle it on your own. Nobody can.
"
2,12,Stan,"My dad lets me watch cartoons.
"
14,2,Butters,"Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. 
"
2,12,Wendy,"She does. She looks very pretty.
"
12,11,Stan,"Craig, it isn't our fault! You make it sound like we always wanna be in situations like this but we don't have any choice!
"
14,8,Butters,"You sure you want to do this?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Okay...
"
15,6,Butters,"I'm trying, sir! 
"
12,6,Randy,"It's not working, Gerald.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, thank God, Flora!  Alright, who do you vote for?
"
16,12,Stan,"It's awesome. You should try to get it on that Ancient Civilizations show so that people can see how cultures used to live.
"
5,4,Cartman,"What's so funny?
"
9,11,Cartman,"Thanks Jody! Gingers, how are we feelin'?  Can I get a Red Power?
"
10,13,Cartman,"We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry abuot. 
"
4,17,Stan,"You guys, knock it off! We have to record this! 
"
9,6,Butters,"Eric, ye-you're just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event.
"
3,1,Kyle,"Dude, we're totally lost! We're gonna die out here!
"
6,12,Kyle,"Well, I'm sure glad this is all over with. Let's go count our candy.
"
10,14,Stan,"Hey that's right. We need a ringer. 
"
5,2,Stan,"We told ghost stories, a-and learned how to make a tornado in a glass bottle!
"
1,12,Stan,"Whoa!
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, crap!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Yeah, we know.
"
9,10,Randy,"Boys, I'm really proud of you. You've done an amazing thing for marriage rights. 
"
10,14,Stan,"What are you talking about?
"
2,4,Kyle,"Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska! 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Chef, does poo go to heaven?
"
4,15,Stan,"Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
"
12,10,Kyle,"Ah, I don't know, it just feels like... there's got to be something else going on here.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"And that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended. There's still some sort of skeletons in the closet, but things between us are a little better.  Okay, children, well now it's time for us to elect a class president,  so first we must pick nominees.  Who would like to nominate someone?
"
6,2,Stan,"Fries... fries...
"
11,7,Butters,"Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. 
"
15,3,Kyle,"Well, cou, couldn't just you know, get rid of the part of Tooth Decay?
"
9,5,Randy,"Oh boy, they're really gettin' into each other's heads out there.  Yeah! Let's go, South Park! These Fort Collins kids got nothin'! Wooo!
"
2,15,Kyle,"Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?
"
5,10,Stan,"That isn't funny, Cartman.
"
10,9,Cartman,"It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?
"
4,17,Kyle,"...Mr. Hankey! Hoh, we were so worried! I was waiting up for you and you didn't come, so I thought that-
"
3,11,Kyle,"God job, fatass!
"
9,5,Cartman,"I don't think so! You guys are way too good! You're the best at this game!
"
7,5,Cartman,"She's not here right now.
"
16,8,Butters,"My goo doesn't come out every night, but I sure do seem to have a surplus of it. 
"
12,13,Mr. Garrison,"All right, kids in seats, kids in seats.  Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.  This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the Communist east side and the Democratic west side.
"
7,14,Butters,"We came over to cheer you up, Stan!
"
10,11,Kyle,"Prove it!
"
18,6,Stan,"It's just...
"
7,2,Kyle,"Dude, that's not cool. You shouldn't make fun of Christopher Reeve.
"
18,3,Randy,"It's okay, it's gluten free.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, Jesus tap-dancing Christ.
"
4,7,Cartman,"Oh good, you got the crappy kidney.
"
7,4,Kyle,"Cartman? Cartman?? 
"
8,6,Cartman,"...Train together
"
5,2,Stan,"Hey, it's Big Gay Al!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Yeah, I've sneaked into Kyle's room lots of times.  You think HIV is something to be laughed at, Kyle? Well...  let's just see how funny it is now, asshole. 
"
7,7,Stan,"We shouldn't have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else. We're a team!
"
2,3,Kyle,"It's poetic justice.
"
13,1,Cartman,"Just because you have condoms doesn't mean you're safe, Kenny! Statistically speaking, the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman! And you're gonna let that near your penis?
"
10,4,Kyle,"Oh thanks, dude.
"
6,15,Stan,"Okay, I'll just use an old standard. He saying ""the money. Stop worrying about the money.""
"
5,1,Stan,"What's meecrob?
"
3,12,Cartman,"Nyah nyahnyahnyah nyah nyah. Guess wha-at I got? Antonio Banderas blow-up doll. You guys didn't get one.
"
7,4,Stan,"Uh Cartman, I think that's a really bad idea.
"
5,11,Cartman,"What's that thing?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well, he didn't actually... write any of it. He just uh...
"
2,18,Kyle,"Well, I fell down this ice cavern,  and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- 
"
9,12,Randy,"All right, what the hell is going on here?!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Jonas Brothers?)
"
3,7,Cartman,"I think not! I'm gonna show this picture to my mom when she gets home!
"
18,2,Cartman,"You, you know diabetes affects us all, but it mostly affects Scott Malkinson.
"
1,6,Cartman,"You piece of crap! I'll kill you!
"
1,7,Stan,"Plastic pumpkin pails...
"
18,5,Cartman,"Because Stan saw the video on my phone, alright? If the video is only on my phone, then clearly we did it! If we downloaded it off the Internet, then anyone could have done it!
"
14,14,Randy,"I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche.
"
8,6,Kenny,"Yeah, sure, whatever. 
"
17,9,Kyle,"Go ahead and tell him, Cartman.
"
8,7,Cartman,"Shoveling accident.
"
6,7,Cartman,"There. We just put the sea people back in the tank with the others, and nobody will ever know.  The blood is washed neatly from our hands. 
"
4,4,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay.
"
6,15,Kyle,"I'm Kyle.
"
7,3,Kyle,"A reindeer?
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-... how much money, exactly?
"
4,10,Cartman,"Ugh!
"
8,13,Kyle,"You don't have any powers!
"
6,4,Kyle,"So what happens now?
"
17,9,Cartman,"We'd like to get XBox Ones please.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Hey, where's Cartman?
"
3,9,Kyle,"Shh. Shut up, Kenny. 
"
18,3,Cartman,"Hey, what the fuck dude?! God fucking damn it!
"
3,8,Randy,"No, I-... I don't know.
"
8,3,Stan,"You can't charge people to watch a guy get tortured for two hours!
"
13,9,Butters,"Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, man, where am I?
"
3,12,Stan,"Relax, dude. What's the big deal? Think about it: if your grandma knew that she could help you, even in death, she would want to.
"
2,13,Stan,"Dude, these dolls are cheap rip-offs! 
"
17,2,Stan,"What happened?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Kyle, just- don't be a dick right now.
"
10,11,Stan,"We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls.
"
8,1,Kenny,"(Butters!)
"
7,1,Kyle,"What is a proc-tologist, Chef?
"
15,11,Randy,"Hi babe. Sorry, I'm...  kind of hanging out with the guys.
"
7,15,Stan,"Dad, don't get carried away.
"
10,12,Cartman,"I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself! 
"
11,14,Wendy,"He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.
"
12,7,Butters,"Make that two! 
"
3,3,Cartman,"Can I have the yellow with a side of white?
"
7,9,Cartman,"Eh hey guys, wait, uh, ..we wannaaa play with you before you go onstage.
"
8,4,Randy,"So wha- so what'd you do? D'you dance back?
"
15,8,Kyle,"Because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or Asperger's!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Ugh! Oh man. The ending to that movie was so terrible.
"
8,12,Butters,"I'm a bad bear. I'm a very bad old bear.
"
12,8,Kyle,"Did we?! Maybe we could have stopped them!
"
10,6,Cartman,"I'm fahn. Just a lit-  No big deal.  Beh.
"
8,13,Cartman,"(Hey! Come over here!)
"
9,11,Cartman,"But... it's me.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Well fellas, entertainment is my life. I love being in front of everyone.  Aaah!
"
8,3,Cartman,"Aw, it got Kyle and it's tearing his head off!  Aw you guys, it looks like Kyle is done for!
"
5,5,Kyle,"Ah, look, Phillip. Everyone in South Park just wants to see your serious side.
"
3,7,Cartman,"But mom, me and Artemus Clyde Frog still have to do our love scene with Salma Ha-yek.
"
16,8,Butters,"Oh, well, ye-Eric, ah I told you: everyone has a creamy filling inside them, where all the feelings of compassion and joy come from. Oh, didn't your dad ever tell you that?
"
8,8,Kyle,"There. Do you really want that asshole to win?
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"WHAT??
"
9,4,Cartman,"Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn't wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.
"
17,3,Cartman,"That's awesome. I'm so stoked that we're best friends.  Fist bump.  Fist bump. 
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"And now we'd like to bring out a couple of very special South Park students who did a report on what the Founding Fathers would have to say about the war. 
"
8,10,Kyle,"Dude, we shouldn't be here!
"
5,10,Cartman,"No there aren't. Jesus, grow up, you guys.
"
14,4,Stan,"Who?
"
8,10,Stan,"Yeah.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah. Hmm. 
"
2,3,Cartman,"Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah! 
"
9,10,Stan,"It's right there, see? 
"
1,11,Stan,"No, you're a fatter lesbian than me.
"
18,6,Jimmy,"You betcha, pal. 
"
12,8,Cartman,"Shaddup! These American traitors might have bought your propaganda, but not us!  Oh, thank God, the police are here! We're safe! 
"
12,5,Kyle,"What?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Sure. Sh-sure, Mr. Hankey.
"
1,12,Cartman,"Stan, would you tell Kyle that I'm not speaking with him?
"
7,12,Stan,"That's what they made me think, too!
"
4,17,Stan,"And why is it that on Charlie Brown cartoons, everyone talks like this.
"
15,7,Cartman,"...Uh we'll let you catch up to us, Kyle. Come on, Kenny. 
"
14,3,Randy,"It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. 
"
6,4,Kyle,"City kids get to go to museums for field trips. We get cow farms.
"
14,5,Cartman,"Let me by...
"
6,9,Kyle,"Do you think we did a good thing, Stan?  I mean, no one even seemed to notice.
"
15,13,Stan,"Yeah, go on dude!
"
7,8,Cartman,"...So? I'm half bisexual!
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy!
"
13,1,Butters,"Huh... a ring that says you'll be together but not have sex... Isn't that called a wedding ring? 
"
11,2,Cartman,"It is?  Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! 
"
16,13,Stan,"Yeah. 
"
11,7,Randy,"Stay awa- ...I don't have any change!  I don't have any chaaaahahange!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters.
"
6,4,Butters,"What is that?
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Who-? Who are you? What do you want?
"
11,7,Cartman,"City of Santa Monica
Lots of rich people
giving change to the homeless
"
4,17,Kyle,"Fine! We'll do it with out you!
"
10,10,Cartman,"Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement.
"
4,7,Stan,"...vein right, well-  Well, here goes nothing. Help me pull his pajamas up.  No way! Kidney Blocker 2000?!
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay.
"
9,1,Kyle,"But our teacher, Mr. Garrison? He just had his penis made into a vagina. How come?
"
13,8,Cartman,"Hey, what the F?!
"
15,7,Kyle,"Yeah, we got him!
"
3,6,Kyle,"Hey, what about that stupid panda?
"
12,11,Randy,"Oh Jesus!
"
2,2,Kyle,"He's bleeding pretty bad back here.
"
8,12,Wendy,"What does she do?!
"
13,9,Butters,"I know what you're saying.
"
4,15,Cartman,"Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free.  We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run?  An ice cream truck! Hey wait!  Boy, am I glad to see you!
"
6,4,Cartman,"You have to talk louder. I forgot the double-A batteries for the SuperTalk play-action headset.
"
8,12,Wendy,"Dad!
"
6,7,Cartman,"Tweek! Where are you going?
"
4,16,Butters,"Hey, uh, what are you doin'?? Ha-I'm ready to give myself to Mr. Elway.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Nnnope. No, I definitely helped write the joke. All I can hope is Jimmy doesn't try and Jew me over.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Well, like my friend Kyle. He's Jewish, so he doesn't have any rhythm.
"
2,12,Cartman,"Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!  Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?
"
3,9,Kyle,"You know, I think we all learned something today. It's fine to have your own beliefs and your own traditions, but as soon as you start excluding people from your ways, only because of their race, you become separatists. And being a separatist sucks ass.
"
10,9,Stan,"Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11.
"
12,2,Stan,"Yeah, don't you recognize us? We're Britney Spears' kids.
"
2,6,Stan,"Well, I only..did it 'cause... he..molested me. 
"
8,8,Stan,"I'm not voting!
"
11,13,Kyle,"Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. 
"
11,14,Stan,"Who cares what dumb girls think, right? 
"
10,2,Stan,"George Clooney's acceptance speech?
"
15,14,Cartman,"Oh wow, poor people being arrested. What a rare occurrence.  Hi, Kenny! Kenny, wave!  That's Kenny, about to be sent to a foster home. Pretty funny.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Why not?
"
5,8,Stan,"Yeah. 
"
1,9,Kyle,"Wait...
"
8,14,Stan,"Oh, whatta? 
"
1,13,Cartman,"That's niiice, Peter Panda.
"
7,15,Kyle,"No Ike! Shh!
"
18,7,Cartman,"What?  Hello?
"
7,13,Cartman,"You guys, Kenny's eating his own hands. 
"
5,9,Wendy,"The Afghan kids are caught in the middle, too!
"
4,6,Stan,"Haha, he-yeah ha.  Haaaaah.
"
9,3,Cartman,"She's got a hell of a chin on her, I'll give her that. 
"
16,4,Kyle,"That's just how God is.
"
8,4,Stan,"Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- 
"
6,4,Kyle,"...No I won't.
"
12,7,Cartman,"Get... get that guy! Shoot that guy! Yeah, and then over here!  Oh, you got it. Nice. 
"
1,12,Cartman,"No, not when money is involved, stupid! 
"
2,2,Cartman,"Eh-- 
For I've got to be free
Free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore
And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on
Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay
A gathering of angels appeared above my head
They sang to us this song of hope
And this is what they said
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me
I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
"
3,16,Stan,"Well then, why didn't he give me what I wanted?
"
8,14,Stan,"No, he didn't.
"
12,3,Cartman,"Mmmmmmmmmm nope. I have no idea what you're talking about, Kyle.
"
16,3,Kyle,"Hey!  Faith Hilling is not out of style, alright?
"
12,9,Wendy,"That's right.
"
9,12,Randy,"Stan, do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind Scientology?
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
"
14,2,Butters,"I wrote that. 
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, let's just delete all this tabloid garbage, mkay.
"
16,3,Stan,"What seems pointless?
"
5,3,Kyle,"Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
"
5,3,Kyle,"That's right.
"
18,6,Randy,"I'm not having a glass of wine, I'm having six!  It's called a tasting, and it's classy!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Butters, is that you?
"
3,12,Cartman,"Well, I'm going to Spooky Laboratory!  Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells...
"
1,3,Stan,"A hook.
"
14,5,Cartman,"If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-
"
8,1,Cartman,"What?
"
16,13,Stan,"I have?
"
13,1,Stan,"Yeah, their purity rings turned our friend into a douche!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Aw awww!
"
15,3,Mr. Garrison,"Whereas salagadoola mechicka boola = x and bibbidi-bobbidi-boo is y, put 'em together and whattaya got? Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. x + y = y, x = 0. The song is badly written. Second verse: x + y = bibbidi-bobbidi cubed + boo-
"
7,14,Butters,"On my girlfriend.
"
7,15,Stan,"Sure dude.
"
12,14,Butters,"Uh, well I'm sorry, Dad. I- it's just that I've been really preoccupied lately. You see, there are these kids at school and they want-
"
12,1,Cartman,"So this is it?
"
4,13,Kyle,"Whoa, dude..!
"
10,10,Randy,"With a student? But... she's a woman.
"
7,8,Kyle,"Oh no! Dad's metrosexual too?
"
8,6,Kyle,"What's wrong with his face?
"
15,6,Butters,"I love you too, Dad.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Well, here goes everything. 
"
10,8,Butters,"Hey fellas!  Boy, this is neato, huh?
"
7,11,Cartman,"Uh...  He-hey Kyle! Knock knock.  Knock knock, Kyle!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Oh, really?
"
3,13,Cartman,"Now you're gettin' it.
"
18,7,Stan,"Yes! Yes, you have answered all my questions and I am pleased with the customer service I have been provided!!  You guys? Are you there?
"
10,3,Cartman,"That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!
"
7,8,Kyle,"Clear!
"
5,6,Kyle,"Hoh Gohod, I popped it!! Oh hit huhurts!!
"
11,12,Stan,"No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon.
"
4,11,Cartman,"Let's see... Matthew 15:11. ""Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which comes out of the mouth defileth a man."" That's a good one, Clyde Frog. Interesting. 
"
8,9,Stan,"One of the creators told us. You have to take your keys over to the television department.
"
7,10,Stan,"What is that?
"
7,4,Kyle,"Ih ih ih-t's g-gay?
"
18,7,Stan,"Kyle, maybe this is for real.
"
8,5,Butters,"Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?
We used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.
He was my ten gigahertz old pal.
My robot friend.
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"Stan, are you wearing a different hat?
"
11,5,Stan,"But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?
"
13,1,Kenny,"(A purity ring.)
"
17,3,Butters,"Holy Moly.
"
10,14,Stan,"When you shoot the puck to another player.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Dude, this is my fuckin' bathroom!
"
12,7,Butters,"I am so disappointed in myself. Teacher gave me a res-responsibility, and I was just supposed to look after my partner, and I blew it!
"
18,7,Cartman,"And why did the guys send you, Kyle?
"
10,3,Cartman,"Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!
"
12,1,Kyle,"You sleep with money. Every night?
"
17,7,Cartman,"Okay, we need to start immediately, please.  Ah, very good. The House of Greyhawk has agreed to join our fight!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Why? It's perfect. If everyone's blaming the tobacco companies, then nobody's blaming us.
"
4,6,Kyle,"What?
"
6,16,Butters,"Follow me back home, Stan. It's time I let you in on a horrible s-secret! 
"
6,12,Kyle,"Stop him, Kenny! 
"
9,9,Wendy,"Yeah. How about we all give you a little makeover, Marjorine?
"
4,11,Butters,"Uh, we can help Timmy learn how to ice-skate, too.
"
4,13,Kyle,"Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast.
"
16,13,Stan,"It's all right, Dad.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
3,6,Kyle,"About what?
"
3,8,Stan,"We're going upstairs.
"
7,11,Stan,"Yeah, it'll be awesome. Just the four of us.
"
13,10,Cartman,"Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
"
7,14,Butters,"Well, I don't want to, Lexus, but my stupid friends wanna go.
"
8,12,Wendy,"Hey Jessie , hey Kal. Do you guys mind if I hang out with you? The other girls are acting really strange.
"
9,11,Kyle,"Can you guys meet me over at Cartman's house tonight at around midnight?
"
17,6,Kyle,"I'm not better, I'm just... doing what needs to be done to make the world a better place.
"
6,7,Butters,"Take all the beer cans in South Park and have them shaken up in a huge mixer at the paint store so that-
"
17,2,Randy,"What is Minecraft and how do you tame a horse in it?!
"
16,4,Cartman,"But dad, my friend Kyle says that if we don't do whatever the Hebrews want us to do, God is gonna kill little Egyptian boys.
"
6,13,Kyle,"Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah dude, that's like the fifth power you've come up with!
"
1,8,Stan,"Dude, that's not a digital sports watch.
"
6,3,Butters,"Wow! Scooped-out face guy! Ah-ah-I've seen you on TV before.
"
16,5,Mr. Mackey,"Uh who said?
"
15,10,Cartman,"You're asking me to simply ignore a kid who - excuse my language but I have to be harsh here - a kid who shits in his pants in front of everyone - to just ignore that so he can have a normal life?!
"
3,3,Cartman,"Got it! 
"
16,3,Cartman,"Why would we look at a newspaper, retard?
"
1,12,Kyle,"I didn't steal anything.
"
1,2,Kyle,"Stop who?
"
1,11,Wendy,"Don't fuck with me!
"
10,1,Kenny,"(Yeeeeehah!) 
"
10,6,Kyle,"What?
"
15,11,Randy,"Not much, sup with you guys?
"
6,15,Stan,"Hey, I've seen that guy. He has a TV show where he brings people on and talks to their dead relatives.
"
2,11,Kyle,"To where?
"
10,3,Kyle,"It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together.
"
6,9,Stan,"Over here! 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Yes, Butters, my soul is finally at peace. It's time for me to leave.  Goodbye Butters! Thanks for all your help! Be good and be safe. Goodbye...  Goddamnit, what?! I've made everything right!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Yes I may be born again, but I was wasn't born again yesterday.
I wanna get down on my knees and start pleasing Jesus! I wanna feel his salvation all over my face!
"
6,16,Stan,"I really, really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning.
"
2,12,Kyle,"To me??
"
3,2,Cartman,"Ow! You can do what you will, but I am the Lamb of God.
"
13,11,Butters,"Hey Stan! I heard you were looking for people who care about the Japanese slaughterin' whales.
"
11,7,Kyle,"Hi. I've uh...  I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this.  It's twenty dollars. 
"
6,9,Cartman,"We only have until 10 a.m. tomorrow!  Get the lead out!
"
4,7,Cartman,"He's fakin'! 
"
12,1,Stan,"What did he do?
"
5,6,Stan,"Kyle!
"
7,11,Kyle,"It's like the Disneyland of Mexican restaurants.
"
4,11,Timmy,"Oh-aagghhh! 
"
15,12,Cartman,"HAAAAGH! 
"
17,1,Butters,"Can I ask you something? When was the last time you went to your local DMV?
"
4,10,Timmy,"Timmiih!
"
8,10,Butters,"N-no reason! 
"
14,14,Randy,"I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy.  Love you, Sharon. 
"
6,15,Stan,"Kyle, you can't ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said. They all just use a technique called ""cold reading."" They've used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them.
"
13,9,Butters,"Thank you! 
"
13,12,Kyle,"Because we're not referring to gay people! You can be gay and not be a fag.
"
2,14,Stan,"Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass.
"
11,5,Randy,"Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?
"
2,17,Kyle,"Sshh, don't scare him.
"
3,1,Kyle,"I want two tostadas and mild sauce.
"
6,13,Butters,"They took his precious, took it away to watch without him.  He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious.
"
5,3,Kyle,"I'm Kyle.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Alright, listen to me! We must take a strict vow of silence!
"
4,2,Stan,"For one tooth?
"
3,17,Cartman,"The brown noise! Kenny and me found the brown noise! Here, look! Look.  There, okay. Let's see here.  Right there. Okay. Okay. Ready, Kenny?
"
9,14,Stan,"No, he just needs a disciprine. But thanks to you people, my dad now thinks he has a disease that he can't cure himself.
"
14,14,Randy,"I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! 
"
6,2,Stan,"Dude, he's got Heather!
"
10,4,Kyle,"Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!
"
6,1,Kyle,"That's a great idea!
"
7,12,Randy,"Who?
"
1,3,Cartman,"Heh, that's not scary.
"
2,18,Cartman,"They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey.
"
9,12,Kyle,"Look, Stan, we're really getting concerned about this cult that you're getting into.
"
4,8,Stan,"Uh that, that's okay, dude, I think we got it.
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"I want you all to take a serious fucking look at yourselves! M'kay?! Act I was pure fucking dogshit! If Tooth Decay is singin' flat, then the whole fuckin' thing sounds flat! Wuhkay?!
"
5,8,Stan,"That was the longest day of school ever!
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better 'cause they're better people.
"
17,1,Cartman,"See, I didn't read it either, but I saw the puppet show version up at Casa Bonita. We have to do something about this! We need to organize a rally! 
"
12,8,Kyle,"We can't just leave!
"
2,10,Kyle,"No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back.
"
14,9,Kyle,"She said they're from New Jersey.
"
9,13,Cartman,"I'm all wet! Sweet!
"
7,11,Butters,"Are we out in the destruction?
"
18,2,Mr. Garrison,"There's always somethin'. For me it was the soy sauce.  Sneaky, sneaky soy sauce.
"
7,1,Kenny,"(Hey you guys, look.) 
"
4,17,Stan,"""We wish you a m- Merry""
"
12,2,Butters,"You killed her! 
"
4,17,Stan,"AAAAAAAA!
"
11,10,Butters,"Watch it, fellas. I'm pretty sure this guy wants to rape us.
"
8,4,Butters,"Waaaaah!
"
2,15,Kyle,"God, will you shut up?!
"
3,12,Kyle,"He must have a huge bone in his ass, then. 
"
13,5,Jimmy,"I'm trying to write jokes. But I'm not as funny as you, so it's tough.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Come on!  Other people have to use the bathroom, you know? Can you hurry up in there?! 
"
7,11,Stan,"Really?
"
4,1,Cartman,"Kenny! Kenny, you have to get me out of town!
"
12,9,Butters,"Well yeah.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Alright. Clyde Donovan, 2.3 inches.  You see, witnesses? That's .2 inches more than what the school said.
"
16,8,Cartman,"Hey Butters, you got a minute?
"
16,13,Stan,"What's the big idea, Craig?!
"
1,5,Cartman,"Baby?!  Well, at least I don't get my ass kicked by a girl!
"
8,3,Cartman,"All right, what kind of atmosphere are you reading, Vulcan Jew?
"
12,2,Randy,"Looks like next harvest will be even better. 
"
3,3,Kyle,"That bitch!
"
9,5,Stan,"Okay, so then we'll just tell the other team quietly that we're gonna let them win, and then we'll act like we're trying. Our parents will never know.
"
6,6,Butters,"Ah, the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup. I love bringing chaos!  And that's only the beginning! 
"
5,1,Timmy,"Sss...sss... shit. 
"
2,12,Wendy,"Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare!
"
6,5,Butters,"Uh because! Uh my parents are out of town, and I don't have a babysitter.
"
8,1,Stan,"Very well, Professor Chaos! We'll play along. Now, fell the fiery sting of my tonfa of Takanawa!  Hey kid, that knocks you down.
"
1,7,Stan,"Oh man, I feel like a total choad.
"
2,4,Cartman,"Okay?
"
6,9,Stan,"Relax, Tweek, we're just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened. There are more important things right now than free hats.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Yes. These people, Jakov, these people need you. I need you. Please, Jakov. Stay?
"
10,4,Cartman,"No gay speeches, Kyle!
"
12,11,Stan,"You guys, look at this.  It's a wall of ancient drawings. 
"
2,12,Kyle,"Okay.
"
6,12,Stan,"Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...
"
6,16,Cartman,"Listen! Parents understand one thing, and that's consequences. They need to see consequences from their actions, or else they'll never learn. What my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way.
"
8,4,Butters,"Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?
"
5,10,Stan,"Oh boy.
"
11,7,Randy,"There isn't enough food for more people up here!
"
3,2,Kyle,"Don't worry, guys. I'm getting a nurection as we speak.
"
8,8,Stan,"You-you're all joking, right?
"
2,13,Stan,"There he is!
"
11,10,Stan,"Why?
"
14,4,Kyle,"Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend.
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yes, but now we don't have any homework, so we can go see Timmy play downtown at Mile High Stadium
"
8,9,Kyle,"No way! You wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the Wall-Mart.
"
18,1,Randy,"Wuhuhull, boys, there's more to starting a company than having a catchy name.
"
18,9,Wendy,"So I guess there's this new trend with young people where the celebrities they look up to most are YouTube commentators. Just ordinary people who sit in front of a mic and blab their opinions about everything while their mindless loyal followers cheer them on. Isn't that crazy??  Well let's meet one of these stars of the internet. Please welcome CartmanBrah! 
"
5,10,Kyle,"Hello?
"
4,8,Wendy,"Oh God, please don't let this be happening.
"
16,10,Randy,"Thought we wouldn't find out??? 
"
16,7,Butters,"There's a new girl that started school here today. And she's joined the cheerleading squad.
"
9,9,Butters,"How about we read each other's future?
"
16,10,Randy,"Sure um... Chad, is it?
"
12,10,Kyle,"Gracias.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Well all right then, fag! We can't turn back now! The path to adventure lies just beyond this ticket counter! And if you four have really come all this way just to turn back now, then seriously you guys, the FUCK?
"
10,10,Cartman,"Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search it. Here's the hotel!  Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here!  All right, let's go! Move out! 
"
5,8,Stan,"Can you tell us where ""that"" is, please?
"
8,1,Kyle,"Well, let's see how he likes the icy blasts from my nunchucks of Sokuromoto! 
"
5,8,Stan,"This is gonna be one looong-ass day. 
"
2,7,Kenny,"(Uh oh. Hey uh, you guys! Help me doooowwwwnnnn! Heeyy, you guuuuyyyyys!) 
"
8,2,Kyle,"I know that I often have serious moral objections to the things that you do, but... this time I think you really need to reconsider, because if you do this, I believe you will go to hell. So I feel it is my responsibility, as your friend, to tell people what you're doing, and to put a stop to it!
"
2,5,Kyle,"Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?
"
7,15,Cartman,"How could you be so stupid!
"
18,5,Cartman,"I know, right? Now everyone's gonna see it.
"
16,8,Randy,"Wait wait wait, wait. Whoa! What! The! FUCK?!
"
7,6,Cartman,"I don't know. I was hoping you guys did.
"
7,14,Butters,"Huh?
"
13,5,Kyle,"You know what, Cartman? I believe you.
"
1,3,Cartman,"What?! Scuzzlebutt's real?!
"
2,9,Kyle,"We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
"
3,2,Randy,"Wow.
"
15,7,Stan,"So this is normal?
"
1,13,Stan,"How 'bout some ice cream?
"
2,7,Stan,"We believe in you, Fonz.
"
9,12,Stan,"I'm totally depressed.
"
14,5,Stan,"For what?
"
13,13,Cartman,"""Thank you"" and this is to..?
"
4,1,Butters,"Okay. Everybody ready? On your marks.
"
2,18,Stan,"Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3.
"
9,8,Stan,"No.
"
7,13,Stan,"Anti-smoking people are trying to kill Cartman and he won't stay away from us.
"
7,12,Stan,"What happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Sir, sir, that is my ho!
"
13,13,Butters,"All right! Cartman's president. We did it.
"
10,9,Cartman,"I rest my case.
"
11,1,Randy,"Awww! Awwww! 
"
9,3,Stan,"Oh no!  Hey! That's our client! 
"
2,11,Stan,"Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?
"
18,2,Randy,"What about the Powerbars? The Powerbars?
"
16,11,Butters,"Yeah, I guess so. Except it still doesn't change the fact that Ben Affleck gets to be handsome, talented, and then gets to go home and kiss Jennifer Lopez.
"
9,5,Stan,"Damnit!
"
12,7,Butters,"Oh no! I'm not sneakin' out! I'll get in trouble!
"
13,14,Butters,"Okay, thanks. 
"
14,9,Mr. Garrison,"Jesus! Why are they doing this?
"
2,13,Kyle,"We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
"
10,4,Cartman,"Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Uhhh-woo wow! Isn't this great? You guys seeing each other again?
"
9,8,Kyle,"Dude, you have to tell everyone. Right now.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Cool, just, you know, don't touch me 'cause I'm not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.
"
3,15,Stan,"It fell;
"
17,10,Wendy,"Ugh!
"
7,3,Cartman,"It's the right address-wait! Look there!  There's Mrs. Streible! This is the place. 
"
5,13,Kyle,"What, Cartman?
"
9,11,Cartman,"Better red than dead!
"
2,15,Kyle,"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!
"
16,10,Cartman,"I do, but you don't know that! I could be Kyle trying to take more of my shit!
"
9,6,Cartman,"God forgave the Jews, you should be able to forgive me!
"
16,14,Cartman,"Oh God damn it Kyle, I was just about to get what I wanted.
"
17,10,Wendy,"See, the problem with having fake pictures of yourself is that you start to believe in your own bullshit! This has gone way too far!  And if society won't fix it, I will!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Okay. Okay okay. 
"
3,15,Kyle,"with dreidel I shall play.
"
13,6,Randy,"Stan?
"
2,18,Kyle,"You're a dick!
"
18,6,Kyle,"But you accepted money from the Canadian government! To push a freemium game on us! Why would they do that?!
"
9,9,Kyle,"The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.
"
18,8,Stan,"This late?
"
2,16,Cartman,"Wait a minute. This isn't a present, it's a shirt! 
"
3,5,Cartman,"You mean the other jakovasaur?
"
2,16,Cartman,"Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a biiig present, for no reason, except that I'm cool.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Oh no..!
"
14,4,Stan,"What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
"
16,5,Kyle,"Pansy.
"
18,6,Stan,"Nothing! Dude, I bought like $10 worth of Canadough. But check it out, I unlocked the stadium in Toronto. 
"
14,2,Butters,"That's nice. 
"
13,8,Kyle,"Hey! Heeey!
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Uh, god damnit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. 
"
5,4,Kyle,"Yuh huh!
"
10,3,Cartman,"You know we might not even make it into the studio.
"
3,4,Stan,"So I guess we'll be going now, and live with the knowledge that... you're both kind of sissies. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"It sure is. Do you want me to watch it with you, Ike?
"
15,14,Stan,"Well it sure is good to have you back, Kenny.
"
2,13,Stan,"Hold on, Cartman!
"
14,4,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
10,7,Cartman,"Whoa, how did I do that? 
"
8,4,Stan,"I thought I was supposed to!
"
3,8,Butters,"Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that's all. That's all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Well, I guess everything's out on the table now, huh Kyle?
"
5,6,Butters,"Hoh.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Just keep stalling, Butters. We don't have the dead pig quite ready yet. 
"
1,4,Stan,"Damn it!
"
4,8,Wendy,"I'm totally back to normal. See you later. 
"
3,3,Kyle,"Well, you are taking Chef from us. 
"
4,15,Cartman,"Yes.  A chocolate friend.  Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are.  Look at how yummy and sweet he is.  ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars.  ...There you go.
"
16,4,Cartman,"So interesting, wow. 
"
2,12,Cartman,"Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!
"
18,2,Cartman,"So who do we throw the party for?
"
18,6,Stan,"I don't know, I'll figure it ou! Jesus Christ!
"
9,9,Stan,"Yeah, there's just one problem: a boy can't go to a chicks' slumber party.
"
5,3,Kyle,"I'm not going anywhere!
"
14,9,Cartman,"Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?
"
15,2,Cartman,"Wir egal un die Comedy Awarding Thing. Es war Kinder der special education. Sie macht uns wählen. 
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"Sure, kids. 
"
12,7,Stan,"I reckon that maybe you could make a jail door that opened with numbers instead of keys. You know, like a biiiiig safe.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Eighteen thousand dollars.  How about just... three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine, ninety five.  How about five bucks?
"
13,11,Stan,"You know, when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone, people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit! 
"
7,6,Kyle,"Ohh, right, you're supposed to pull and master-benate your wiener really fast.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"Hi, boys.
"
1,13,Stan,"No, dude. This look really serious. I think we'd better get help.
"
16,1,Randy,"Yeah thanks.  Asshole.
"
16,4,Cartman,"But my friend Kyle, he says that the reason we've had all these plagues and stuff because you won't let all the Jews leave.
"
1,11,Kyle,"And I got these killer Birken-stocks.
"
18,2,Kyle,"Dude, that would have to be like, the best party ever.
"
6,6,Butters,"But why?
"
17,7,Stan,"No, you can't do that!
"
12,9,Stan,"What?
"
8,8,Randy,"Your vote still mattered.
"
6,16,Stan,"Thanks for staying after school and tutoring me, Butters.
"
7,7,Randy,"Stan? Okay? You just don't understand the fine points of gambling. You're never supposed to stop when you're on a winning streak.
"
1,5,Stan,"It isn't fair!  Everybody hates me!  The whole town wants me killed!  Mom and dad are gonna send me away!  I don't want to be sent away!  I want to stay here!  Eehhhehehe!
"
6,16,Stan,"Fine, then you can come with me. 
"
1,4,Kyle,"Oolala 
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling.
"
3,15,Kyle,"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel,
"
6,4,Cartman,"Mike, speak.
"
7,8,Stan,"You've gotta get with the times, girlfriend.
"
9,2,Butters,"Ah I will, Mom.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Don't give us that crap! She's no good to you dead and you know it!
"
1,7,Stan,"You said we were going to be Raggedy Ann and Andy, remember?
"
3,13,Cartman,"A present?? Is it a rocket racer?? No, let me guess: It's a Frogman Jay doll! No wait, I know! It's a police power chopper!
"
8,6,Kyle,"Yeah. Yeah, that counts.
"
5,7,Stan,"""So, we meet again, Jennifer Lopez!""
"
2,10,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
5,2,Stan,"Cartman, don't say ""use him"", you big silly goose. 
"
4,2,Cartman,"Two percent, have my penis cut off.  Two percent-
"
10,7,Kyle,"Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool.
"
6,6,Cartman,"The swimsuit competition really gave us a fresh look at some of the candidates. 
"
16,5,Stan,"Kyle, I'm trying to make a difference!
"
14,1,Kenny,"(Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)
"
1,1,Kyle,"Totally!
"
12,5,Butters,"Yeah, that must be his.
"
2,4,Kyle,"You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!
"
14,3,Randy,"Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on. 
"
4,2,Stan,"You guys! You guys! I figured it out!
"
5,2,Randy,"Oh, no.
"
1,11,Stan,"I can't afford a cruise, dude.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Well I... really would need to go home first and get my... Weh no no, I guess I have everything I need. Oh, okay, sure.
"
12,6,Randy,"Ohhhhhhhhhh! Ohhhhhhhhhh!
"
4,12,Stan,"God-damnit, this is ridiculous.
"
8,14,Stan,"I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!
"
12,8,Kyle,"No, wait. No, we have to stop them! They're raping him. Rape!
"
4,12,Mr. Mackey,"After being dismissed from teaching, he went off to write romance novels. His first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay Pulitzer Prize, and was considered the best homoerotic novel since Huckleberry Finn.
"
10,2,Randy,"A ticket? ""Failure to care about the environment"" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!
"
13,9,Butters,"Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job.
"
8,1,Cartman,"C'mon!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Come on, you guys!
"
1,5,Kyle,"This must be it. 
"
2,3,Kyle,"How's it goin', dude?
"
18,5,Cartman,"Nobody followed you, right? You didn't tell anybody?!
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, girls should totally be allowed to play sports, you just can't expect people to want to watch. Okay?  All right.
"
6,17,Kyle,"You bastards. 
"
11,1,Cartman,"Yeah, come on! Here we go!
"
3,10,Stan,"Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective.
"
15,6,Butters,"This is illegal. We could get arrested.  Oh Jesus!
"
11,10,Kyle,"I thought I did. 
"
4,2,Stan,"Dude, having this much money is great! Working for Loogie rules!
"
13,1,Stan,"What?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"I'm... not gonna perform in the talent show. 
"
6,1,Kyle,"The liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat. 
"
4,16,Stan,"Hey, you guys came back!
"
4,7,Butters,"Can I go now?
"
6,8,Cartman,"Maybe... No.
"
5,8,Stan,"Alright, alright, but you guys gotta see if you can sleep over for the rest of the weekend.  It's Saturday at 2:30 - that means we have... 39 hours to play GameSphere until school on Monday!
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh, uh, pardon me, sirs.  Dad? No.  Hm. 
"
10,6,Kenny,"(What are we gonna do??)
"
10,6,Cartman,"Ah I don't think so, dude. 
"
1,6,Stan,"Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us ""genetically inferior."" The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!
"
10,14,Stan,"I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed. 
"
12,11,Randy,"Hey we're down in... Main Street now and...  Wah? Oh, ohh, look at that.  Ohhh!
"
17,9,Stan,"Yay.
"
11,2,Butters,"I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! 
"
11,11,Stan,"Your what?
"
4,9,Cartman,"...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer.
"
4,7,Butters,"Hey, watch it!  Hey, what are you doin'? 
"
2,10,Randy,"What?
"
18,7,Butters,"What what what?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Jimmy, dude, did you see?! Carlos Mencia is taking credit for our joke!
"
6,2,Cartman,"Hey! Have you guys ever seen this trick?  When someone's sleeping, you can take a glass of warm water,  and you put their hand in it... 
"
16,12,Stan,"Stay gold. 
"
16,11,Butters,"Well I won't do it, you hear me?! I'm not licking anybody's... testes!
"
2,2,Stan,"Oooh- hey, Kenny.
"
12,3,Kyle,"Kenny, we need to have a serious talk.
"
4,14,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Then why did I see ice cream and cookies when I closed my eyes?
"
5,8,Stan,"G'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.
"
3,8,Stan,"We're just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you've gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. 
"
10,14,Stan,"I'm not playing, I'm coaching.
"
2,8,Cartman,"No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Disposing of the doll wouldn't be easy. He would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it.
"
14,5,Randy,"What the hell was that?!
"
14,10,Stan,"Aaaaaagh!
"
18,9,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell?
"
2,12,Stan,"Oh.
"
14,11,Cartman,"Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people,  and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news.  You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends.
"
3,10,Cartman,"C'mon. Give me Pengin!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Aw man, it tastes like that, um, you know that cream-chipped-beef stuff that Chef makes sometimes.
"
4,2,Cartman,"I know!
"
16,14,Cartman,"Well then, I guess we're about to play a game of Chicken, General Tso. 
"
16,9,Cartman,"What? That little bitch beat me in the ratings?! Oh HELL NO!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oh, it's soo completely funny!! Ahaha this is certainly funny!!
"
9,2,Cartman,"It's not potholes you need to worry about. It's potheads. I know what these people are capable of. '
"
13,3,Randy,"But that's... impossible. Why would he do this?
"
12,12,Stan,"Kyle, Kyle you gotta get out here.
"
10,9,Stan,"Why?!
"
7,5,Kyle,"Stop it!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"How do you take credit for something you didn't do?!
"
11,2,Kyle,"Shut up!
"
8,4,Butters,"Hey! Can I still dance with you guys?
"
14,10,Stan,"Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!
"
5,4,Cartman,"...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!!  Ready, pony?  Bite it!  Yes!! 
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, well that was the point, dingleberry! Ah-t put that down!
"
1,10,Stan,"Nono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.
"
16,13,Stan,"Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters, no! Are you crazy?!
"
9,4,Kyle,"Cartman's side is right, for the wrong reasons. But we're wrong, for the right reasons.
"
5,10,Cartman,"An interrupting cow who
"
5,6,Cartman,"No, no, wait, you don't understand.  since I was th-three years old it has been my dream to have one million dollars...
"
2,9,Kyle,"So how was that movie last night, dude?
"
7,7,Randy,"There's more to life than profits!
"
2,4,Kyle,"No, it's his bris.
"
12,14,Butters,"12:32 p.m. Vampires meeting in the school gymnasium. Leader appears to be a fifth grader.
"
10,2,Butters,"But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
"
16,6,Kyle,"AAAAH! 
"
5,6,Cartman,"This can't be happening! AGGGHH!!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Uh, nnno, thanks. I'm not hungry.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Then saw off the arms and legs. 
"
15,13,Kyle,"We saw it on your channel.
"
5,7,Kyle,"""Oh God it burns! It bur-huhurns!""
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Come here, mom! Let me get it!) 
"
5,14,Butters,"Heh-alright, Mom, I'm all done wrappin' Dad's anniversary present for ya.
"
8,1,Butters,"Enough! I grow weary of your foolishness. Professor Chaos cannot be stopped!
"
5,8,Kyle,"Dude, it's got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.
"
6,3,Cartman,"God, isn't Butters awesome for doing this, you guys?
"
10,10,Cartman,"Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!
"
15,13,Kyle,"Dude, there's a guy with a gun here!
"
15,12,Cartman,"...You got rid of Clyde Frog... You burned Peter Panda! 
"
18,7,Cartman,"What did I tell you about removing the headset when you're not back in the access hub??
"
5,10,Cartman,"Please get the kind with marshmallow inside. I don't like the peanut-butter filled one.
Eric.
"
6,4,Stan,"No!
"
18,5,Jimmy,"Ohhhh nothin'. It's just that... y-you might wanna invest in some hedge clippers. 
"
15,5,Cartman,"And so am I correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine?
"
1,12,Stan,"Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on. 
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
12,8,Butters,"Uhuh, Eric.
"
7,6,Kyle,"But before he could go through with this entire plan, he discovered that the pie had already been eaten...  ...by your dog. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"What the fuck is going on?!
"
2,10,Kyle,"What's ""ookie mouth""?
"
8,13,Kyle,"I see... a man... with a baseball cap.  He's killing now... Oh! I'm seeing it all flash before my eyes! The guy's name is Michael Deets, and he lives at 621 Castillo Street. He's usually there between seven and eleven p.m.
"
6,13,Butters,"Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. 
"
16,11,Butters,"Aim... my anger! Stupid  Ben Affleck!  Waaah! 
"
14,9,Randy,"We got him!
"
5,2,Stan,"When do we want it?
"
17,9,Cartman,"The interface is pretty cool. See, I told you guys, it's really a... it's a seamless interface.
"
7,4,Randy,"Mayor, our peace rally has always been set for this Saturday! Now, these pro-war bastards are suddenly trying to say they get the town square.
"
10,11,Butters,"Uh whah well can't you just take a plane?
"
2,12,Stan,"Yes, Mr. Garrison.
"
7,7,Butters,"Hey, I know! How about a dog parade? 
"
13,12,Stan,"Do you ride a big loud Harley and go up and down the streets, ruining everyone's nice time?
"
18,9,Stan,"I don't get it. The whole fun of Call of Duty is that you get to do the shooting.
"
16,12,Kyle,"What happened to you?
"
1,2,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely.
"
9,3,Kyle,"Get out!
"
10,1,Stan,"No, he's not.
"
5,13,Stan,"What?
"
6,15,Kyle,"Kenny's ashes were in an urn, and Cartman drank it, thinking it was chocolate milk mix.
"
14,10,Wendy,"Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?
"
8,3,Kyle,"You were, you were right?
"
6,10,Kyle,"Hoh! Hoh hoh hoh hoh! 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Uh, can we see them-him-her?
"
4,7,Mr. Mackey,"M, m'kay
"
15,5,Cartman,"Somebody's gotta eat all that bacon, Kyle. Might as well be us. Welcome to the firm. 
"
4,8,Cartman,"Huh.
"
2,7,Cartman,"What?! I'm missing the new Fantasy Island.
"
15,5,Kyle,"...What are you doing here?!
"
3,2,Cartman,"Just get me down from here!  Oh, finally! My arms are killing me!
"
8,4,Mr. Garrison,"I could only imagine the rage building inside you, Stan. I bet you can't wait to out-dance those OC bastards!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Of course, you guys! And then we can make... ten million dollars!  Look, the tooth fairy thing didn't work, the boy band thing didn't last, so I tried this route.
"
14,6,Cartman,"Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.
"
2,3,Kyle,"Here, give me that.  ""I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond.""
"
1,12,Stan,"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
5,3,Kyle,"...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square.
"
10,2,Randy,"I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend.
"
2,4,Stan,"Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!
"
12,11,Mr. Garrison,"What do you mean ""guinea rats""?
"
5,10,Butters,"Ah, hang on a second. My mom said to make sure I look good this time in... the school pictures. 
"
5,10,Kyle,"They found the butt-face people's son, Butters. They're gonna have a big reunion at the milk company!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Oh no, there's much more.  Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it ""New Moon Rising"".  I did a whole study using my ass.  Here it is using some high-contrast stuff.  trying out some... different light filters here.  But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass.
"
3,11,Cartman,"No, no, he's done for. Come on! 
"
10,9,Butters,"Can I go now?
"
16,7,Stan,"Dude, why are you so into their relationship?
"
2,11,Kyle,"Sshh!
"
9,5,Randy,"I can fight anybody. I just need to train. I just need to get in the best shape of my life.
"
5,10,Cartman,"E-heh. No no no, I blew a funny fuse.
"
6,2,Kyle,"Dude, it's been twelve hours. Where the hell are our parents?!
"
1,3,Stan,"Whatabutt?
"
7,9,Butters,"Whoa, you sure seem with it, Eric. You must have some... ih-inspiration.
"
10,2,Cartman,"I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.
"
2,12,Randy,"Okay.
"
14,2,Randy,"Read what?
"
16,14,Cartman,"What's it look like? Hundreds of thousands of votes from all the swing states.
"
18,6,Stan,"I don't know if you're listening, but... I guess I have something inside me that I can't control. Something... kind of dark. Please... help show me the way? 
"
1,5,Stan,"I don't think an elephant would make love to a pig.
"
7,10,Randy,"GET OFF... GET STRAIGHT OFF THE STREET!
"
6,9,Kyle,"Yup.
"
7,8,Cartman,"Oh, please Craig, we're ten times gayer than you!
"
4,3,Cartman,"Take that! 
"
3,5,Cartman,"I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. ""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor...""
"
12,7,Butters,"What are you whoofelin' at? 
"
2,4,Stan,"Man! That sucked, getting searched. 
"
3,11,Mr. Garrison,"I hope you give them the chair!  Anyway, children, as I was saying, Hare Krishnas are totally gay. 
"
5,8,Cartman,"Wow, this is like finding trashcan gold, you guiys!
"
2,10,Cartman,"Oh weak!
"
2,12,Stan,"Oooh.
"
14,9,Cartman,"And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could even be a spy!
"
3,2,Stan,"Whoa, dude, my dad's famous.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Elder, It's not my fault. He told me he was Jewish.
"
14,2,Cartman,"Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!
"
8,4,Butters,"No.  No no no no no no, no!  No! No no no no!
"
5,13,Cartman,"Buh, alright.  eh, Butters?
"
1,11,Stan,"You can say that again.
"
16,2,Kenny,"(Fuck yeah!)
"
13,14,Kyle,"Aaahh. Well-  AAAAH! 
"
9,8,Stan,"I literally broke the dam!
"
8,11,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
14,4,Kyle,"Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's.
"
5,6,Cartman,"I changed my mind! I don't want your stupid park!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Dz-n-Doctor Pal?
"
7,14,Kyle,"Come on, Stan. We're gonna play dodgeball.
"
9,5,Stan,"... What?
"
8,5,Cartman,"Greetings. I am the AWESOM-O 4000.
"
2,15,Stan,"Why do you keep saying ""hella,"" fatass?!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Um. Actually, AWESOM-O was not programmed for that function.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmih, Timmih Timmitimmi Timmiih!
"
17,2,Stan,"So?
"
12,2,Stan,"Look, uh, we feel really bad, and, and we wanna help Britney however we can.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Oh, cool. Please take a seat.
"
5,2,Butters,"Me neither. 
"
18,7,Stan,"Butters called Customer Service first?
"
8,12,Butters,"Ah, shucks! 
"
7,5,Kyle,"All right.  All right, I guess it's possible.
"
1,8,Stan,"Yeah, how did he make those clicking sounds?
"
8,4,Butters,"Aaaaah!  Aaaaah!
"
7,10,Randy,"GAAAAAH!!
"
1,2,Kyle,"I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
"
15,1,Butters,"We know. It's preposterous.
"
9,2,Cartman,"No! No, we have to stop them! You know how we-?! We gotta stop them! Hebbiaaay! 
"
12,1,Kyle,"AAAAAAA! 
"
11,7,Randy,"No!
"
16,8,Butters,"...Oh right, I, I'm sorry. Well, everyone has a creamy filling, Eric. And and some people have so much of that filling that it, that it comes out sometimes. A lot of times, when I go to sleep, and especially if I've had them wonderful dreams that make me feel really good, sometimes I wake up, and when I wake up, I I realize some of my goo has come out.  But I always make sure I keep it, just in case I ever run out of all my sunshine happy feelings.
"
1,12,Stan,"Well, you might as well let it go.
"
8,14,Mr. Garrison,"Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother.
"
16,14,Cartman,"I want a part in the new movies!
"
18,8,Cartman,"Kewwwl!
"
7,9,Randy,"Four hundred dollars? Just for downloading some songs off the Internet? It's not that big a deal.
"
13,14,Stan,"Well dude, what are you gonna do? Just hang out here at the table all day?
"
17,9,Cartman,"It's fine, Kyle. Everything's been taken care of. Stan won't be telling anybody anything... ever again.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Hi Ellen.  Do you guys like fishsticks?  Thank you, thank you. No, really. Thank you.
"
15,7,Stan,"That's such a shitty device to keep people playing.
"
5,4,Cartman,"I don't believe you.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention.
"
1,13,Stan,"I always wondered if that would work.
"
5,7,Kyle,"No they don't!
"
2,7,Wendy,"Hey, he's like Rudolph.
"
6,15,Kyle,"Don't try and stop me, Stan! This is what my grandma wants!
"
1,10,Stan,"Aaanh, he does this all the time.
"
4,15,Kenny,"(Ow.)
"
16,12,Kyle,"But what about the costume contest?!
"
11,4,Cartman,"A snuke?
"
15,13,Cartman,"Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down? Kyle? 
"
12,3,Randy,"And you never really get a good look at her naked boobs anyway. 
"
8,5,Butters,"Oh, o-o-all right AWESOM-O. Let's get us some shut-eye,  or what, or whatever robots have. 
"
2,8,Kyle,"Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics.
"
6,15,Stan,"Uh, over here please?
"
2,9,Kyle,"What the hell? 
"
9,13,Kyle,"Goddammit, say something!
"
1,4,Stan,"Being gay is just part of nature, and a beautiful thing.
"
16,3,Kenny,"(This is Tango. I have the goods.)
"
14,5,Kyle,"Aww come on! This is ridiculous! 
"
18,7,Butters,"There's an old fat lady here! She's holding out money for me!
"
7,8,Stan,"Dude! W-what are you doing?
"
3,10,Cartman,"Yeah, dude, that's way over. 
"
10,11,Kyle,"Holy crap!!
"
16,12,Randy,"Wuhy? Why isn't anyone showing up?!  It's Halloween night! People should be renting spooky movies!  What's happened to the world? Things used to be so simple.  Good evening, fine sir! I would like to rent a movie!
"
2,16,Cartman,"I can't believe I got a stupid shirt!  The holidays are bullcrap!
"
2,15,Kyle,"It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?
"
4,6,Kyle,"Don't you think you owe everyone an apology for bringing NAMBLA here?
"
9,6,Cartman,"Butters, Goddamnit, I'm not in your imagination! I'm dead and for some reason you can see me!
"
6,10,Wendy,"Oh, hey Bebe.  Slut.  Slut.
"
1,10,Cartman,"Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! 
"
4,9,Cartman,"Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!
"
10,12,Cartman,"You're gonna help me freeze myself.
"
1,6,Stan,"Hey Chef.
"
6,7,Stan,"Hm.
"
9,12,Stan,"Uhhh, sh-sure?
"
12,14,Butters,"I can't do it. Ah, I- I can't do it!
"
5,1,Stan,"This sucks. Now that ""shit""'s out, it isn't fun to say it anymore.
"
4,7,Stan,"But I don't think it's working.
"
15,8,Cartman,"There you go, Molly, and a bag of chips.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Whoa, look at that.
"
9,4,Cartman,"He's right in here.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Hello. We'd like two orders of Kung ...Pao Chicken, please.
"
1,11,Wendy,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
"
10,1,Cartman,"It's okay Chef. Go on, remember!
"
4,2,Cartman,"You almost had me for a second there, Mom, heh. ""There's no tooth fairy."" I suppose you're gonna tell me there's no Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, or Jesus, either, heh, heh...  M- Mom?
"
11,3,Cartman,"That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. 
"
11,2,Cartman,"But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. 
"
1,9,Cartman,"How about we sing ""Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch"", in D minor.
"
10,9,Kyle,"But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11.
"
11,12,Cartman,"You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
"
14,8,Butters,"Pissin' me off!
"
5,7,Stan,"Red rocket, red rocket!
"
4,12,Timmy,"Please-a help me.
"
10,4,Kyle,"Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!
"
6,10,Kyle,"I'm showing her.
"
9,11,Kyle,"Hey.  That's a great idea!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it's on a collision course for Earth.
"
6,5,Butters,"Oh, I'm so glad we didn't miss it! 
"
14,9,Kyle,"Know what, Ma?
"
2,12,Randy,"--thing will work out.
"
17,6,Stan,"Should I try them?
"
6,16,Stan,"Dude, that's not extreme enough! My parents aren't gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls! I want them to see what they did was wrong! I want them to have them to admit that they lied to me!
"
9,13,Jimmy,"The Ch-Chinese will take someone to space for t-t-ten million dollars.
"
1,3,Kyle,"Oh my God! Look at his leg!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Look, can you guys just get down to business so we can go find my little brother?
"
13,14,Kyle,"That wasn't the Mayan apocalypse, you racist idiot!
"
7,11,Cartman,"Jimmy! Hey Jimmy, wait up!  Dude, uh I need your help on something.
"
14,14,Stan,"Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!
"
18,10,Kyle,"These producers making a big holiday special!  They had me upload a video for a commercial they're about to air! They said my hash tag was awesome, and they wanted to promote it!
"
4,17,Kyle,"You love-
"
9,7,Jimmy,"But the talent show is tomorrow night!
"
10,14,Stan,"They're not gonna kill us.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Chuh!  Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!
"
3,2,Stan,"Dad, you've got to work! People are dying, dad. You've got to come up with a solution!
"
8,5,Butters,"AWESOM-O! 
"
5,14,Butters,"Hey, a new paint brush. That's what Dad could get Mom for their anniversary. I gotta go tell him. 
"
2,12,Kyle,"What the hell have you gotten me into?!
"
7,14,Butters,"Here we are, Mom and Dad! 
"
4,10,Stan,"Dude, you just said ""ass""! That's a sin!
"
18,5,Cartman,"What? 
"
4,16,Cartman,"Parents?  Ah, you mean the birth-givers. They're not around.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Really? What about?
"
12,5,Cartman,"I am here... to teach you calculuuus.
"
8,6,Kyle,"Hey Blanket. Uh, look, we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood. You... wanna come with?
"
3,12,Randy,"KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!
"
18,9,Kyle,"It's dying. The living room is... dying.
"
1,7,Cartman,"Come on Stan! Remember how she dissed you at the costume contest?
"
9,8,Cartman,"Stan... beaver dam!  Very large beaver dam, Stan!! 
"
15,4,Stan,"Dude, why would the school put up the sizes of our wieners?
"
6,3,Cartman,"Could you um... go on the Maury Povich show with me and say that I'm out of control and do drugs and have sex so that I can go to the largest putt-putt gold course in the wwoooorrlldd?
"
16,10,Cartman,"Just wanted you to know that if you wanna steal somebody's stuff, you should look elsewhere.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Gih-  Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?
"
13,10,Kenny,"(I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)
"
6,4,Randy,"Jesus Christ!
"
16,5,Mr. Mackey,"Stan? Stan, okay, ABC called and Dr. Oz is suing you and our entire school! What are you gonna do?!
"
6,13,Randy,"Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story.
"
10,10,Cartman,"You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!
"
1,10,Cartman,"No, my birthday isn't until Saturday.
"
9,10,Timmy,"Timmiih!
"
6,5,Stan,"Jesus Christ, how long is this commercial break gonna be??
"
5,10,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! You guys! 
"
14,4,Cartman,"It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?
"
4,9,Timmy,"Tiimmmaaayyy! 
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady.
"
6,12,Cartman,"Right. Your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at Barney's Beanery by lying about a hair in it.
"
5,10,Cartman,"You know, all the usual stuff. Dirty jokes, funny movies, seeing someone die...  This morning, I even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and... I couldn't laugh. I mean I... I knew it was funny, but I couldn't laugh.
"
18,5,Jimmy,"Hey, Craig. Have you checked out the Internet lately? 
"
17,10,Wendy,"Watching what Photoshop is doing to society... Little girls are aspiring to have bodies they can't possibly have! We have to put a stop to it.
"
2,2,Mr. Garrison,"What?
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"I'll bet we could!
"
2,10,Kyle,"You!
"
2,18,Stan,"Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!
"
7,10,Randy,"Sometimes, yes, but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly, Stan. We can't just take their licenses away.
"
5,10,Stan,"Yeah. He lives about four houses away in the bad side of town.
"
4,13,Stan,"But they smell like pee.
"
9,6,Butters,"Eric.  Well, be careful, ghost pal.
"
16,12,Cartman,"Dude dude dude! Check it out. 
"
16,12,Randy,"You guys don't understand. We're doing a big Halloween promotion! I've put up flyers and I've got apple-bobbing  and candy corn . This is the night we turn it all around.
"
10,8,Cartman,"Then let's move out! 
"
5,5,Mr. Mackey,"Sh. We're watching ""Behind the Blow,"" m'kay.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Tweek and Craig are gonna fight.
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Hey guys, what's going on with you?)
"
14,2,Kyle,"We can get people to believe us now!
"
8,9,Randy,"Heeeey...  Gerald, what are you doing?! We said we weren't going to shop at the Wall-Mart anymore!
"
16,14,Kyle,"What?
"
8,3,Stan,"That movie sucked ass. Give us back our eighteen dollars.
"
14,8,Cartman,"You love NASCAR huh?
"
14,14,Kyle,"We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?
"
4,1,Stan,"Get on the sled, you fat piece of shit!
"
8,4,Butters,"...No.
"
12,9,Stan,"Dude, there's nothing I can do about it.
"
11,12,Butters,"Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland?
"
9,5,Stan,"Uhh, hay guys, look, we don't wanna win, so uh,  here's a list of all the pitches I'm gonna throw, in order.
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh okay uh, uh stand by I- I think it's, I think it's landing. 
"
7,1,Stan,"Look, there's five billion people on our show. You just can't up and cancel on us.
"
3,11,Stan,"Come on, dude. There's gotta be somethin' about Starvin' Marvin in the news.
"
9,14,Randy,"Okay... Okay, hang on... Okay...  Okay, hang, ha-, ...hang on... Hol-! Hold on.  Wa-hang on, hang on. 
"
17,6,Stan,"You know, I don't think when Gandhi starved himself he was all ""Dude, look how fuckin' awesome I am for starving. Check me out!""
"
6,13,Jimmy,"They are coming.  You guys go on ahead.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also see how other things react.  Evaporation is an exothermic reaction, so let's look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, position 7 please.  Now I'm gonna put the glass tube under Mr. Slave's tight ass.  The heat from Mr. Slave's ass will act as our new conductor of energy
"
11,13,Kyle,"Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?
"
4,1,Cartman,"Well, that's not all. I snuck something in for you, too.
"
1,6,Stan,"Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
"
5,6,Cartman,"Just give me my money back.
"
4,3,Kyle,"How can you say that?
"
2,9,Kyle,"It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
"
9,2,Cartman,"These are what we call the uh giggling stoners. Pretty common form of hippie, usually found in the attics. Problem is, if you see one hippie, there's probably a whole lot more you're not seein'. Uh, whe-where's the backyard.
"
2,17,Kenny,"(Look at me! Look at me!)
"
10,11,Cartman,"Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else.
"
12,14,Butters,"Yes sir.  Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It's like nobody even cares if there's vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Look! There's an old refrigerator!  Get inside, Butters! I'll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!
"
6,4,Butters,"Ehuh, the Chinese puppy's... my favorite so far.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Sh! You hear that?
"
9,10,Kyle,"Why?
"
12,1,Kyle,"Then why did Butters say he helped you sneak into my room last Friday night?! 
"
15,5,Butters,"Slash is make-believe??
"
5,1,Kyle,"Bu- but I got these tickets to see Lion King on stage.
"
5,1,Kyle,"A... curse word.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Jesus, I can't do anything.  I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government.  Uh, hello? Jesus?
"
10,1,Stan,"Come on guys, we might as well go. 
"
3,2,Randy,"All right. Now, let's get to work.
"
7,11,Kyle,"How are you going to try to get invited to Casa Bonita this time?
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Rrrrooowwwrrr, rroowwrr, pew, pew, POW.) 
"
18,8,Stan,"Gee, thanks!
"
3,14,Cartman,"No! We still have to fight!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Well, go put that pizza in the oven, bitch! I'm hungry!  Ow!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Now, first thing we do is Photoshop the bulges on her sides . We select the eyes , make them a nicer shape, take off any blemishes on the skin , lengthen the neck , add more to the hair , select the lips and make them fuller , take out any puffiness on the skin  here, add fullness to the breasts, lengthen the torso, take away that fold of skin , streamline the shoulders , put highlights in the eyes , and, there.
"
2,4,Mr. Mackey,"I can't, man. Jerry Bear's dead, m'kay?
"
10,13,Cartman,"...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle! 
"
18,8,Cartman,"Dude, he's like a beast! He's got more legendary creature cards than I've ever seen!
"
6,4,Kyle,"We're with you, dude.
"
8,3,Stan,"Yeah. I told you that!
"
15,13,Cartman,"Oh no. Oh NO!
"
8,12,Wendy,"That's okay.
"
17,10,Butters,"Oh. Yes?
"
7,10,Randy,"They've tried to stop them, son, but... the seniors get up so early in the morning they... get everything done before everyone else is even awake!
"
18,5,Cartman,"Alright, I have a way that we can make Craig's mom happy.
"
18,6,Cartman,"How much money did you micropay today, Stan?
"
6,5,Stan,"Dude, I'm not going.
"
3,12,Stan,"Where's your costume, fatass?
"
1,11,Stan,"You're just saying that, Cartman.
"
8,14,Stan,"Uuugh!
"
16,13,Stan,"Jesus, everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect. Why didn't you say anything?
"
2,17,Cartman,"I love you guys. 
"
13,12,Cartman,"I think I just need uh two, maybe three buckets of KFC, extra crispy, probably ...four cartons of gravy.
"
14,10,Stan,"Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!
"
1,3,Cartman,"Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing. And where his leg should be, there's nothing but…Patrick Duffy.
"
9,13,Stan,"Uh, 'xcuse me, we're looking for the Mexican... Aeronautica y Spacia Administrashown?
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Your attention, please. Will Kyle Broflovski report to the principal's office?
"
3,2,Stan,"(I don't think I like this new law.)
"
16,4,Cartman,"You can't scare a Jewpacabra, Butters. Don't forget we're dealing with a creature that drinks blood, hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of Christ.  Did you hear that? I'm going to try a Jewpacabra mating call now. NO CHRIST! NO CHRIST! I'M REALLY NOT BUYING THIS WHOLE CHRIST THING!  He's here somewhere.
"
11,6,Cartman,"Okay, gracias.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Yay, XBox wins.
"
10,10,Cartman,"Beth! Bear-mace that guy!  Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me!
"
6,17,Stan,"Oh no.
"
16,2,Stan,"Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! 
"
13,12,Randy,"Look out, it's a bunch of pissed-off faggots! 
"
9,3,Kyle,"Her life belongs to us!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"I really feel like I did all that work for nothing. People still think comedy is nothing but a big joke. I mean, come! on!
"
13,8,Kyle,"But, dude this doesn't make any sense. I mean, if you know it's going to make you crap blood, why wouldn't you at least just try eating less of it?
"
16,12,Stan,"Guys, you're okay!
"
9,4,Kyle,"Dude, we have to do whatever we can to get that feeding tube put back in!
"
4,16,Kyle,"Do you think they're gonna pissed at us for lying that they molested us and sending them all to jail for ten days?
"
3,8,Randy,"Who?!
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"Aggghhh! 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. 
"
10,10,Kyle,"Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!
"
7,10,Randy,"Well, I think this has been a real learning experience for the Marsh family. People died, but we all grew a bit. Let's just go home.
"
7,12,Kyle,"Wow!
"
15,8,Kyle,"What are you doing?
"
2,13,Kenny,"(I don't know. I can't find him.)
"
1,6,Mr. Garrison,"She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Okay, there. Now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked.
"
6,13,Kyle,"Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.
"
17,8,Kyle,"No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded. We're not playing dirty!
"
9,2,Randy,"Yeah, but when we did it we actually stood for something. I mean, remember Woodstock, Sharon? We actually did something there.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Euh! Once again Butters is tryin' to screw us over! That asshole!
"
6,7,Kyle,"Ah, alright.
"
6,6,Butters,"Well sure you do. Ah I am professor, and you shall be my general. From now on you are General... Disarray.
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Hello, Mr. McGillicuuhuhuhh... Mr. McGillicuddy. 
"
9,6,Cartman,"Not really...
"
14,9,Kyle,"I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Well, okay... here... l'see...
"
18,4,Randy,"Wacky Races?! Holy shit!
"
11,2,Cartman,"No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... puts a penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!
"
7,11,Kyle,"Butters was supposed to go with us to Casa Bonita tonight.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Profile status?
"
17,5,Kyle,"No.
"
10,8,Stan,"What?!
"
16,9,Cartman,"Oh yeah, that's good. That's accessible now. Cool, let me try to take a shit in this real quick. 
"
13,7,Cartman,"Kevin, Goddammit! 
"
7,14,Stan,"...conformist.
"
6,10,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
10,14,Stan,"I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Wait, you guys! I just had an amazing idea. Token is going right to the top, right. I mean, he's gonna be a huge star.
"
2,12,Cartman,"That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!
"
5,1,Cartman,"You guys!!! Hey you guys!!! Oh my God!! Oh my God, you guys!!
"
7,15,Kyle,"So how do we get to Ottawa?
"
7,4,Kyle,"No, turdpants, it's Kyle!
"
3,8,Randy,"Oh he, he lives in, like, Florida.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Oh, that's cool.
"
10,13,Kyle,"... I'm hanging up now.
"
9,3,Kyle,"We knew you could do it!
"
16,2,Cartman,"Nice bolo tie, Stan.
"
8,4,Randy,"Stan, listen to me. I don't want you feeling like you have to do that competition now to avenge me.
"
1,3,Kyle,"No, No thanks, that stuff tastes like pee.
"
6,7,Stan,"Well, drop them in! 
"
15,8,Cartman,"Fever... Light... lightheadedness... I don't know what's wrong with me.
"
6,1,Stan,"Did you bring the camera?
"
6,1,Mr. Mackey,"Uh hey, yeah. We, we woulda never laughed about this before.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Like, eight days ago.
"
8,6,Kyle,"Dude, look who I found prowling around in my back yard.
"
18,1,Kyle,"Washington Redskins?
"
2,12,Randy,"Okay, okay. 
"
12,7,Wendy,"What's going on?
"
6,13,Randy,"Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? 
"
5,9,Randy,"Stanley, your mother's a little freaked out right now. Why don't you go play with your big brown package from Afghanistan outside?
"
6,4,Stan,"Oh yeah, they're too weak to move.  Well, we've gotta get 'em out of here. We'll just keep them at Butters' house until they can get their strength back.
"
7,11,Kyle,"I'm still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.
"
6,13,Randy,"I'm a...fraid it was... Backdoor Sluts 9. 
"
9,11,Stan,"Cartman?
"
12,5,Butters,"Huh?
"
7,5,Cartman,"I don't care, 'cause I'm the one that's gonna get in trouble if you don't-! Okay, okay, wait, okay um, fine fine fine!
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Oh Eric! Uh, Eric, I know we kinda threw you under the bus, mkay, but I hope you understand the faculty didn't really have a choice.
"
12,9,Cartman,"Actually, I was thinking... let's just keep this between us. I was wrong to make fun of breast cancer, and I'm very remorsefulness.
"
2,5,Stan,"Damn, dude. China's fucked up.
"
5,5,Cartman,"Awesome! Give me mine! 
"
2,11,Stan,"Dude, what just happened?
"
3,10,Kenny,"(Fuck you!)
"
11,12,Stan,"Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you.
"
7,7,Butters,"How can they do that, huh? How can they make us all move away?
"
2,11,Cartman,"Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want.
"
16,6,Kyle,"We don't mind.
"
1,12,Kyle,"I don't know. 
"
3,2,Mr. Mackey,"Have you guys been sure to pass gas regularly so you don't spontaneously combust?
"
7,9,Butters,"Wow!
"
4,12,Stan,"W-what did you get in a fight about?
"
12,14,Butters,"Yes! Yes, anything else?
"
1,7,Kyle,"Hehe. Why the hell did you dress up like Raggedy Andy dude?
"
16,3,Kenny,"(Well,... ...and I can't take any of that!)
"
12,10,Cartman,"Ha!  Serves you right, assholes! 
"
11,5,Randy,"I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!
"
3,14,Cartman,"But we don't have to lose.
"
1,5,Kyle,"I got it mail ordered from Africa.  The ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks, but it only took three.
"
17,7,Butters,"Well ih-it's just that they have a lot of girls' boobs and vagina's and stuff, but most times they show a man's wiener, it's because that guy's in a love scene with another guy. Do you think it's because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers?
"
13,4,Stan,"Oh boy!
"
15,7,Kyle,"We're gonna level up to detective!
"
17,5,Cartman,"I said THAT SUCKS, DUDE.
"
15,4,Randy,"Yeah, Jews! And all this stuff that the government's doing!
"
9,12,Stan,"I don't know.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Right. And then I say, ""Yeah.""
"
3,16,Stan,"Well, if Cartman is the only one who get it and he thinks he's too grown-up to hang out with us on New Year's Eve, then screw him anyways.
"
17,7,Stan,"And who do we have on our side?
"
6,13,Cartman,"Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. 
"
10,10,Butters,"Uhh, okay. 
"
2,9,Cartman,"Yes. And I've learned something, too.  Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home.
"
8,10,Butters,"Oh, all right then. 
"
13,9,Stan,"Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!
"
2,5,Cartman,"My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
"
13,9,Stan,"Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses.
"
7,1,Cartman,"But it was one of the best times I've ever had.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Pooinshower. Madalen shine debaur. Huelar she mashartah me shur har.
"
9,5,Stan,"No... NOOO!!
"
6,8,Randy,"Well, Sharon and I are havin' a great time bein' atheist. I for one can't believe I used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say. 
"
3,4,Stan,"Well?
"
4,9,Stan,"Kenny says that's not what it means.
"
12,14,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, so now the computer will show a command bar, m'kay, and we type in ""x = y + 1"". Mkay, and then it says we hit Command-Y to bring up the menu screen.
"
5,4,Cartman,"But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
"
11,14,Kyle,"I'm last? Last?
"
3,5,Kyle,"No way, dude!
"
7,3,Stan,"It doesn't matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad.  I think you're right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.
"
4,3,Stan,"No! We've just gotta convince these chicks that America kicks the ass out of every other country. Come on! 
"
13,13,Wendy,"I don't have time for this.
"
4,16,Stan,"We all know that one day, the Provider will set us free. Make everything like it was in the before time. In the long, long ago.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Nono, I've been a hater, and I really am sorry.
"
6,17,Jimmy,"On the s...seventh day of Christmas my t...true love ...
"
1,13,Cartman,"No! Noooooo! No, God, Nooo!
"
15,7,Stan,"Yeah dude, it's just shit.
"
10,13,Cartman,"It's an emergency! It's an emergency!
"
3,16,Kyle,"Cartman got his, then Kenny. What if tomorrow Stan says he got his and I'm left out? I might not even get to be their friend anymore.
"
5,6,Kyle,"No, I mean, this is impossible, Stan! Cartman is the biggest asshole in the world! How is it that God gives him a million dollars?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Hey, ah, Nichole, right?
"
9,5,Randy,"Heeey batterbatterbatterbatter heydn no hit no hit can't hit can't hit can't hit it can't hit it can't hit it.
"
7,9,Kyle,"I don't know!
"
11,7,Kyle,"We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
"
2,15,Kyle,"Leave him alone, butthole!
"
1,6,Stan,"Bad.
"
6,17,Jimmy,"Wow, what a terrific audience. Thank you for giving me this great honor, Mayor. B-before I l, l.. light the tree, I was wondering if I could sing... my favorite ...Christmas song, real quick.
"
6,7,Butters,"Stupid Simpsons...
"
11,14,Wendy,"Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something!  Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle.
"
5,1,Kyle,"I'm going to the kitchen! This is stupid!
"
7,4,Kyle,"Yeah. We have a report to do, asshole! Get up! Get up!! 
"
11,2,Cartman,"Mom, she's lying!
"
3,10,Stan,"He said, ""Garrison-san sabuchii da naa.""
"
13,5,Cartman,"What?!
"
14,10,Randy,"That does it! 
"
6,10,Kyle,"She did, but now they're saying we have to start going back to school anyways. It's totally gay.
"
6,10,Randy,"I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday,  you'll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most.
"
1,3,Stan,"I'm gonna bag Scuzzlebutt. Then we'll see who's the little bastard.
"
16,14,Kyle,"God damn it this is serious, you guys! Cartman has stolen the election!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Trent Boyett is being released from Juvenile Hall.
"
1,5,Stan,"Shelly, you, you saved my life.  And yet, you've done so much more than that.  Today you've taught me the meaning of family.  Sure, families don't always get along, but when the forces of evil descend upon us, we conquer them, by sticking together.  Uh, ahh, oooh. 
"
16,10,Stan,"Dude, what happened?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Is that... Is that how it happened?
"
4,2,Stan,"So you're not gonna hurt us or nothin'?
"
7,9,Kyle,"I'm sure we're gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. 
"
5,1,Stan,"Because it brings a curse? Like the Black Death.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Shut up! Shut the hell up! We're watching this until the next commercial and that's final, old people!
"
7,2,Randy,"Oh, what a fighter.
"
10,7,Cartman,"KNOCK IT OFF!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Well, let's see... Maybe 'cause he's an old, drunk hillbilly dick!
"
2,10,Cartman,"Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!
"
1,2,Cartman,"Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.
"
16,11,Kenny,"(Me?)
"
8,13,Cartman,"In court?
"
1,11,Kyle,"Weak, dude. She only likes other lesbians?
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh.
"
1,2,Kyle,"Bulk up to what, fatass?
"
3,10,Kenny,"(Hey, you guys...) 
"
18,3,Stan,"Dad, is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside?  I mean, can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex?
"
14,5,Randy,"Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators. 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh yeah, I see it. 
"
4,2,Stan,"Okay, the string is tied to Kenny's tooth. You ready over there?
"
2,9,Kyle,"Wait!  I brought him! I brought him to show you! 
"
4,14,Kyle,"Aw, blow it out your ass!
"
10,3,Randy,"Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE!  Take this!!  We've gotta bring all the water we can!!  Shelly, go get my gun!!
"
1,9,Cartman,"YOU SICK BASTARD! 
"
8,7,Stan,"I wanted my job!
"
16,6,Cartman,"You?!
"
2,8,Kyle,"Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?
"
9,11,Kyle,"Yeah, good idea. 
"
2,11,Cartman,"Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams. 
"
2,3,Stan,"They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.
"
12,7,Butters,"No, Eric! 
"
6,3,Stan,"That's your flight, Butters.
"
6,1,Kyle,"Uh, why not?
"
12,7,Kyle,"Right. Except for it really isn't.
"
15,12,Stan,"Hey! Cartman, what the hell are you doing?!
"
3,2,Cartman,"You guys are in big trouble! Now get me down from here!
"
2,8,Cartman,"Okay, that's it!  Screw you guys! I'm going home. 
"
18,10,Randy,"We don't really use this thing anymore.  It hasn't started yet! Alright, Sharon, get on your computer upstairs! Mr. Jackson, you can take the one in my son's room! We've got to tell people the truth!
"
8,2,Kyle,"Cartman! I will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the Special Olympics!
"
12,13,Stan,"Try to do what you wanna do!
"
10,3,Stan,"Does this mean we don't have school all week?
"
1,12,Cartman,"Huh?  Eh. Aaah-ah! Aaah!
"
15,5,Kyle,"Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Who the hell are you?
"
18,1,Cartman,"Boner balls. Boner balls-boner... Boner forest. Dense... boner forest.
"
18,5,Kyle,"That's terrible!
"
12,3,Cartman,"Okay, ready Kenny?
"
1,8,Cartman,"When do we get the sports watch?
"
7,10,Randy,"Get over there! Stay low! 
"
7,7,Stan,"Come on, you guys! This is our town!
"
3,17,Cartman,"Of course we know what a queef is, you queef!
"
8,11,Butters,"Oh J-Jesus, where are my clothes?!
"
12,11,Kyle,"Oh no way! Look!  The pan flute band's put in prison, just like what happened. 
"
15,4,Cartman,"I measured mine this morning. See? It's right here at the top. 
"
4,2,Cartman,"Will somebody take those books away from him?
"
18,2,Randy,"How long do I have to stay here?!
"
4,9,Stan,"Dad?
"
9,6,Kyle,"There were no good times! And if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself!
"
3,12,Cartman,"Mom, seriously! 
"
6,3,Cartman,"Nice.
"
2,9,Wendy,"Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening! 
"
9,11,Cartman,"My fellow gingers! The day of reckoning is finally upon us! 
"
5,9,Kyle,"Cartman farted in there! We had to breath it in for 20 hours!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Eh-everybody bought the whole act! They keep giving and giving until we have it all!
"
13,3,Stan,"But Grandma said I could use this money to buy whatever I want.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Why would I be jel?
"
1,2,Stan,"Dolphins are way smarter than you!
"
15,3,Kyle,"I'm just doing the line.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Sí, gracias. ¿Y tú?  ¡Carlos! ¡Carlos, no! We want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop. That's why we  spackle with the sponge.  See? Spackle gently. Lo marrado. Gently, see? Marrado.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Yes, yes, thank you thank you. Praise Him. I think we're ready to start now. 
"
2,15,Kyle,"We can't deal with you saying ""hella"" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! 
"
13,7,Kyle,"Cartman, knock it off!
"
8,6,Randy,"Stan, time to get up for school.  Stan? What the-?  Mr. Jefferson?!
"
9,7,Butters,"Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy.  I'm just practicin' for the talent show.
"
3,16,Stan,"No.
"
13,13,Butters,"It is true!
"
6,9,Kyle,"Me.
"
1,10,Cartman,"That's ri-aayy.
"
10,2,Stan,"What?!
"
17,2,Wendy,"Refugees from Syria should be considered in need of international protection.
"
11,11,Kyle,"Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Uuugh.
"
18,7,Cartman,"You've been in a virtual space all along, Kyle! Think about it: we're arch-rivals! Why would the guys send you in to convince me of anything?!
"
11,2,Cartman,"I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now,  I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here!
"
4,9,Randy,"You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?
"
2,6,Kyle,"Der, Cartman!
"
5,9,Stan,"How come they hate America so much? What the hell did we do?
"
2,10,Randy,"Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?
"
14,3,Stan,"What'd they say?
"
3,1,Kyle,"Yeah. It happened once before.
"
11,13,Stan,"Huh? What, uh?
"
10,11,Butters,"Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that?  Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls. 
"
11,12,Butters,"Ohhh.  Wait, I'm not grounded.
"
9,8,Cartman,"Dude! Stan! You are in serious trouble!
"
4,9,Cartman,"Alright, guys, here we go.  Hello, sir!
"
16,13,Cartman,"Craig?! You asshole!
"
5,5,Stan,"Huh?
"
7,9,Kyle,"I don't have a choice, dude. I'm gonna swallow my pride, face Cartman, and say ""Congratulations. You were right"" And I'm gonna give him the ten dollars. And hopefully, he won't make a big deal out of it.
"
17,6,Cartman,"You were right, Kyle. A ginger cow. I shall never question your keen intellect again!
"
5,2,Stan,"Was your dad in Scouts, Cartman? Oh yeah, you don't have a dad. 
"
12,6,Randy,"I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad.
I'm goin' down the road feelin' bad, oh Lordy.,
My Internet done up and went away. 
"
2,15,Stan,"Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
"
4,13,Kyle,"Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!
"
3,12,Kenny,"(Mine is so fuckin' badass it's gotta win now!)
"
15,5,Kyle,"You guys, we've just been screwed over and lied to!
"
1,4,Stan,"Thanks for everything Big Gay Al!
"
3,3,Cartman,"Ow! Son of a bitch!
"
17,7,Kyle,"Look, guys, we all have to agree on one system.
"
3,1,Stan,"No, dude! I think Cartman might actually be right.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Oh... Hello, Kyle. Oh man.  Wait, this isn't my house.
"
8,14,Kyle,"My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
"
6,5,Butters,"Oh Jeez. 
"
12,8,Jimmy,"And what about you, Stan? We were all in the theater that day. We all... saw it happen.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, this is all just... this is a dream come true!  Thank you, Principal Victoria! I'll do a great job!
"
18,1,Cartman,"NFL, Catholic Church, same thing! Okay, let's use the Catholic Church! You take a moral stand on issues, you say you're about honor and integrity, and the next thing you know, your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator!
"
15,12,Cartman,"So then, we are all going to need some... more tea.
"
3,5,Kyle,"They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!
"
8,8,Stan,"I guess... I guess you're right. 
"
1,13,Cartman,"Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend. 
"
18,2,Cartman,"Are you going to eat those pancakes?
"
5,13,Kyle,"Kenny's sick?
"
6,12,Stan,"Mr. Garrison threw away his car?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Oh, you mean this one? 
"
3,2,Kyle,"Stan should be Jesus.
"
16,8,Randy,"My son is out there playing that game! It's heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety!
"
6,7,Butters,"Huh?
"
8,6,Kyle,"You bastard! 
"
8,6,Cartman,"Huh? Look dude, we're in the fourth grade, okay? You know what that means? It means we don't hang out with a little kid. Come on guys, let's get back to our Big Wheels. 
"
4,2,Kyle,"You still have baby teeth, Kenny?
"
1,12,Kyle,"But you know, I've learned something today. I've learned that people who want power, a lot of power, always... end up dead.
"
1,9,Kyle,"It's a surprise.
"
13,8,Stan,"Excuse me, uh, if you could do us a favor and pleeease just vote for little Miss Jackson? It's really important.
"
15,7,Stan,"We don't know what you're talking about! It doesn't sound that way to us!
"
6,7,Butters,"Hahaha, and they're probably just realizing that now! Quick! We must turn on the news! 
"
1,2,Kyle,"Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway.
"
5,8,Kyle,"Well let's look in here. 
"
3,5,Cartman,"Sweet.  Mom, somebody's at the door.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Jesus, man, those Earth Day people don't screw around!
"
10,14,Stan,"Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? 
"
3,10,Randy,"Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?
"
2,10,Kyle,"No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!
"
15,1,Cartman,"Hey! Hey, what is this?! Some sort of sick prank?! I get the greatest thing ever just to have it taken away?! Why did you do this to me, God? Next time you're gonna get my hopes up, could you please take me to a grease monkey? 'Cause I like to get lubed before I get FUCKED! Huh?! Some lube would be nice! Or at least a courtesy lick, God! How about a little courtesy lick next time you decide to FUCK me! 
"
2,15,Kyle,"Chef.
"
12,9,Cartman,"What did the breast cancer say to the Polish monkey?
"
3,14,Stan,"Cartman, I'm the leader of the Reenactment Fife and Drum Squad, and I say you play the flute!
"
6,5,Butters,"Whoa, wait fellas.  We can't go to my house.
"
16,1,Cartman,"Well, sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim, but it's a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms, right?
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Don't call people names, Stanley!
"
2,4,Kyle,"What??
"
6,10,Wendy,"Can you believe Bebe? She thinks she's so cool all of a sudden.
"
10,8,Kyle,"See where I am? It's this way. 
"
4,7,Cartman,"You see that?! That's MINE! My asshole friend Stan took my kidney, and I need it put back in!  Please.
"
9,8,Stan,"Shh! Not, not exactly. We were messing around in this guy's new boat, and Cartman egged me on, and, and I crashed it into the Beaverton dam.
"
13,4,Stan,"Butters was just sitting there, Dad. He... he didn't even know it was coming.
"
5,7,Kenny,"(Yeah they do!)
"
13,13,Cartman,"Dude, you can't take my Dances with Smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-
"
15,12,Jimmy,"All you're doing is making the other 99% more angry. I warn you: this could turn very ugly.
"
18,6,Stan,"I'm gonna move here and here, and then I'm gonna roll to kill this zombie.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!
"
5,8,Stan,"What? Who-who is this?
"
5,7,Stan,"Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!
"
12,12,Randy,"Yyeeaahh!!!!  Obama!  WOOOOO! We did it! We F'in' did it!
"
14,10,Stan,"No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-!  G-give me back my sandwich! 
"
11,7,Stan,"Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people?  Sir, could you move a little, please?
"
4,1,Kyle,"Oh yeah?!
"
5,6,Cartman,"You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!
"
1,6,Stan,"We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Aw, come on!
"
2,12,Wendy,"Your turn, Bebe.
"
6,9,Stan,"Uh, sure, and we'll also try to free Hat.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Nobody can! It's gone! You just couldn't take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be!
"
13,6,Randy,"No, we're sure.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Heey, just what the hell do you think you're doing?
"
5,11,Cartman,"Ugh, ugh!
"
7,1,Cartman,"No, it was just a dream,  my mom said so.
"
5,10,Jimmy,"Okay. Try this one on for size: Why did the... pigeon cross the road?
"
9,13,Cartman,"Okay, Kyle. We're gonna get splashed some more, but if you wanna go make love to the whale, that's fine. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"No, this is his brother.
"
2,7,Randy,"Hello, Stanley. It's me, Poppa.  Gosh, your mother and I miss ya. And I hope that... wherever you may be, you'll hear this message. 
Little lamb, you're lost in the great big world
Runaway, findin' streets so cold
"
15,4,Randy,"America is back!
America is back!
"
5,3,Kyle,"How many tickets can we put you down for?
"
6,2,Randy,"Well, our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately. I think ever since their friend Kenny died they've been looking for someone to fill the void.
"
5,8,Cartman,"Awesome!
"
10,11,Butters,"I Iii, I apologize, Mr. Smalls.
"
10,10,Randy,"But... she's hot.
"
14,4,Stan,"Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! 
"
7,1,Cartman,"Okay.  Ohhh! God-dammit! 
"
14,9,Kyle,"Oh, God.  Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!
"
3,8,Randy,"Well, it would be good for you to make new friends. You can't just hang out with your buddy Kyle all the time. People will think you guys are, you know, funny. Now I bet you'll have a great time.
"
16,6,Cartman,"...No.
"
7,3,Stan,"Kyle, we all agreed to do this!
"
18,1,Stan,"Lubricated Titty Burgers.
"
8,13,Stan,"Butters, Goddammit.
"
2,5,Randy,"Damn it, stop.  Oh!  Damm it!
"
11,7,Stan,"All right, I'm turning around
"
2,15,Stan,"Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?
"
1,13,Stan,"Wow, check it out, dude. We have to remember to tape Not Without My Anus next week!
"
13,8,Cartman,"Billy Mays!  It's him!
"
1,9,Wendy,"Aaaah!
"
7,9,Stan,"You got a computer?
"
12,3,Kyle,"All right, look, th-that isn't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend.
"
2,10,Randy,"Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early.
"
4,2,Cartman,"How are we gonna get it from him?
"
11,14,Cartman,"At 1. p.m. tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here.  When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls.
"
2,3,Cartman,"I'm prepared!  For my book report, I read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison?
"
3,3,Cartman,"Ey! Don't call me a little piggy!
"
8,8,Kyle,"Jimmy, we're gonna have everyone write in a mascot that's really funny, and you have to tell us which one would be funnier.
"
3,14,Stan,"Dude, let's just give up right now and accept that we have to be Cartman's slaves.
"
12,10,Stan,"We we speak English!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Suh, suh, suh, suh, Sssunday driver!
"
6,5,Kyle,"We made it! It hasn't gone to commercials yet. 
"
7,3,Kyle,"Who confessed? That doesn't make any sense.
"
10,1,Cartman,"A grizzly bear!
"
16,14,Stan,"Butters, where are the ballots going?! Where are they going?!
"
1,1,Stan,"Cartman, are those the same visitors you saw?
"
1,4,Stan,"Sparky'll kick his ass.
"
7,13,Stan,"Yeah, don't worry dude. Things aren't gonna get out of hand.
"
4,2,Kyle,"Oh my God, this book says that negative and positive are the same thing; that real and not real are one.
"
1,9,Stan,"You know, I learned something today.  I learned that Jewish people are okay.  And that...Channukah can be cool, too.
"
16,1,Kyle,"Well you should. The poor guy shouldn't be screamed for something that just isn't that big a deal at all. 
"
18,2,Randy,"Look, I'm OK! Yuh, you wanna see my dick?
"
16,6,Stan,"Oh, really??
"
4,9,Stan,"Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?
"
2,14,Kyle,"Dude… Chef is gone.
"
9,13,Kyle,"That's terrible!
"
15,12,Kyle,"It's not me! I'm here to help you, fatass!
"
1,10,Stan,"Parents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?
"
2,14,Stan,"Wow! So you'll help him?
"
16,4,Butters,"I'm not saying Jesus is a lie!
"
13,4,Randy,"Okay, that's enough, girls! Alright? I mean, how old are you, Sharon?
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"Oh no, I'm supposed to be at work today.
"
16,7,Butters,"Guess what Larry Barsky just told me?!
"
18,7,Stan,"Alright, I'm nearing Checkpoint Alpha. You guys still there?
"
1,2,Cartman,"I'm up to 94, thank you very much.
"
2,13,Stan,"Oh, yeah, dude. Let's get his ass to the rodeo.
"
5,9,Cartman,"God, I hate you so much, Stan!
"
6,1,Stan,"Oh no, dude, Butters' parents are home.
"
1,3,Kyle,"Don't get scared up in the mountains Cartman.
"
16,9,Cartman,"Yeap. No, this is the problem, Kyle.  You've gottam make your bathroom accessible for my mobility scooter or else I won't be able to take a shit in your house. 
"
6,17,Cartman,"Oh yeah! On Dasher, on Prancer, on Comet-
"
10,8,Cartman,"He's a God damned butthole!
"
7,15,Kyle,"That's okay, we'd rather just go by ourselves.
"
5,5,Stan,"Fine! 
"
10,6,Kyle,"We're trapped in here!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Trent Boyett will do it. He's the toughest, baddest kid in preschool! 
"
6,5,Stan,"The last commercial break has to be coming on any second! 
"
1,7,Wendy,"Stan, I'm awful sorry you got dressed up like Raggedy Andy. Please don't be mad.
"
1,9,Cartman,"Thanks to Kyle's mother.
"
4,4,Stan,"But he's funny.
"
14,4,Kyle,"I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad.
"
9,6,Kenny,"(Yeah, fuck him!)
"
17,2,Stan,"I... said it would really bum them out.
"
1,13,Cartman,"What kind of video did you guys make?
"
13,7,Butters,"We can?
"
3,5,Cartman,"Wow, that's cool. I can help you get ready. 
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, I'm having a real problem with you all having lawyers. It is really disrupting class time!  Uh huh. Ri-oh, uh oh, I see. Oh, okay. Ri-ight.  Kids, what I meant to say is that I fully condone you all having lawyers and support your legal recourses in every way. Now, let's get back to Ulysses S. Grant, if that's okay with you, uhum...
"
9,9,Butters,"You said I'm ugly and flat.
"
7,5,Stan,"I don't know, meh, maybe he can't help it.
"
15,7,Kyle,"Hey Stan. 
"
16,8,Randy,"Yeah, well, the other team was just so awesome on offense I was really scared. 
"
10,9,Kyle,"Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding.
"
7,15,Kyle,"God-damnit, we need to get to the new Prime Minister! NOW!
"
8,8,Cartman,"Well then, perhaps we could interest you in  another butterscotch candy? 
"
7,9,Cartman,"Think about it! It's the easiest crappiest music in the world, right? If we just play songs about how much we love Jesus, all the Christians will buy our crap!
"
1,4,Stan,"Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?
"
12,1,Stan,"He does feel bad for you, Cartman; he just thinks it's... ironic.
"
6,8,Cartman,"It's just that... I can't decide what to buy with your twenty dollars!  I was thinking of getting this mega-man racer for $19.95, or I could get two Broncos trading packs for ten apiece. And then I thought- 
"
1,4,Stan,"Wow! 
"
8,10,Stan,"See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was ""Fireman.""
"
6,3,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
5,1,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, I don't really give a shit. I've done enough shit outside today and shit.
"
6,4,Stan,"...I don't believe it.
"
6,11,Randy,"You can barely even tell you have one on.
"
13,11,Cartman,"All right! Let's go save those whales, you guys! 
"
7,13,Kyle,"But dude, you're making stuff up.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Vote for Turd Sandwich. This is the most important election of our lives.  Turd Sandwich brings us hope for change. A vote for Turd Sandwich is a Vote for tomorrow!
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh hey, Kenny.
"
9,14,Randy,"Is this the line?  Oh God!  Is this whole line people waiting to be cured?
"
10,8,Stan,"I got it! 
"
5,3,Kyle,"Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.
"
4,9,Stan,"Uh oh, mall cops.
"
2,14,Cartman,"It’s all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere.
"
5,10,Kyle,"No it's not, Cartman. You know, there really are couples out there who are missing children.
"
16,10,Randy,"It's over. But you were wrong. We don't have to be afraid of Amazon. The only price to be paid for convenience is that we must be secure with ourselves.
"
2,12,Cartman,"Fine!
"
7,12,Kyle,"Oh, dude, what a little asshole!
"
16,3,Stan,"It will have to do. We're not getting closer.
"
8,5,Cartman,"Would you like to touch my body?
Come on and touch my body!
Oooo, my hot body!
Don't you like my hot body?
Come on and touch my titties!
I felt them just like?
Come on Justin, touch my body!
Mmm, Justin, yeah!
Touch my body! You and me!
Check it out, my not-hot body!
Come on, my body!
"
2,16,Kyle,"I know what you mean. 
"
2,16,Kyle,"Hey, look!  See Mr. Hankey at the Mall of Nebraska... Wow! We have to go, dude!
"
1,6,Stan,"Chef, is it okay to kill your grampa?
"
1,1,Stan,"I said I have a bad itch.
"
7,1,Kyle,"No!
"
3,12,Stan,"Eheh, yes, it ihis, heh.
"
1,7,Stan,"Trick-or-treat with yourself, Wendy!
"
1,9,Kyle,"Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!
"
3,12,Kyle,"This must be it. ""Cleo Broflovski"" That's my grandma. 
"
12,10,Kyle,"Girls like shaved balls?
"
13,8,Stan,"Dude, I don't even know who that is.
"
4,9,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
1,7,Cartman,"Knock it off you guys, she said she was young, and needed the money.
"
5,4,Cartman,"Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott.  Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. 
"
7,7,Stan,"I know. So how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the Indian casino? Tell them, Kyle!
"
3,10,Mr. Garrison,"You bet. I think Chinpokoman is chinpokorrific. I got Shoe.
"
11,12,Stan,"Hello? Can anybody hear me?
"
18,2,Cartman,"It's upside down.
"
17,9,Stan,"Did Kyle know about this?!
"
16,3,Kenny,"(I don't know. That seems quite pointless.)
"
11,4,Cartman,"Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo.
"
7,13,Randy,"What?
"
18,9,Randy,"They shouldn't rehash dead people. It's so wrong.
"
3,10,Kyle,"What's the Primary Main Objective?
"
3,5,Cartman,"Hoo-ray! Jakov is staying, you guys! 
"
16,12,Stan,"I know, but there's nothing I can do.
"
10,14,Randy,"Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Uh. It's over?
"
6,2,Stan,"...pizza... french fries... french fries... pizza...
"
18,7,Kyle,"Well? Are you happy, Cartman? Butters is completely traumatized!
"
15,5,Cartman,"You have some might strong-lookin' workers heah, sahr. I'd be willin' to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Goddammit, NEXT!
"
2,4,Kyle,"Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky. 
"
3,3,Cartman,"If we can hold on to the night.
We've got to find our way together...
"
2,11,Cartman,"Wweell, I might have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship! 
"
7,4,Cartman,"Benjamin Franklin?
"
7,14,Stan,"Okay. 23!  Blue, 23! Set hut! Set hut! 
"
11,10,Butters,"Uhhh, are you gonna rape us?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull.
"
8,7,Cartman,"Dude, I'm takin' a break.
"
2,12,Stan,"Oh, no. 
"
6,16,Cartman,"God-damnit! See? This is exactly why I started this business. If a parent can't respect their child, than who can they respect, huh?
"
1,11,Cartman,"This is a bunch of crap! I've been licking this carpet for three hours and I still don't feel like a lesbian!
"
15,5,Cartman,"Ah, crap! 
"
12,11,Kenny,"(I fuckin' hate Craig!)
"
11,1,Cartman,"Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! 
"
2,15,Kyle,"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!  How are we gonna win the contest with a squash?  Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Well, actually, Cartman's getting a nurection. But then, we're gonna give it you. Sooo, buck up! 
"
3,3,Stan,"Why did Chef quit?
"
14,8,Cartman,"...Uh oh.
"
1,6,Stan,"Jesus?
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"That's just swell, Timmy! Looks like you've outsmarted the principal and the counselor!
"
3,4,Cartman,"I wonder why Kenny didn't wanna take shop class? 
"
7,1,Cartman,"Ah. Uh! I'm trapped inside Helen Hunt's ass!  Oh God, help me you guys!
"
5,5,Cartman,"Don't talk to us, kid.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Oh yes. Sooo this is where the government checks up on its citizens.
"
9,6,Cartman,"All right, come on, Butters, we gotta go tell Token I'm sorry for rippin' on him for bein' black. 
"
1,11,Kyle,"Hey, yeah!
"
8,9,Kyle,"Hey! Hey!  Who the hell told you to put this thing back up?!
"
3,5,Stan,"I see it!
"
10,7,Cartman,"I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Killer.
"
7,10,Cartman,"Oh God, memorial services are sooo boring.
"
15,4,Randy,"Back and we're back and we're back!
We're so back, we're so back back back back back back!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it.
"
7,6,Kyle,"All right, let's see.  Dammit Kenny, that's not what she said!
"
5,6,Stan,"Oh, hey dude. Terrance & Phillip is just about to start.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Huh?
"
7,8,Kyle,"Oh no! They ruined my life! I get to kill them first!
"
14,5,Cartman,"Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!
"
12,8,Butters,"Yeah.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Look, they're nothing, but...)
"
11,2,Butters,"Yeah.  I finished my chores so I came over a little early.  Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Wait for it, wait for the whore line.
"
1,9,Kyle,"I'm a clinically depressed fecophiliac on Prozac.
"
4,8,Stan,"Come on, you guys. We all have to work on this!
"
2,13,Kenny,"(All right! I know!)
"
6,16,Stan,"It's just a stupid plant that makes you dumb. Touching it won't hurt you.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Hope you have a good one. See you later. 
"
2,15,Stan,"Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!
"
15,8,Stan,"...Dude, Cartman Burger? Seriously? How shitty- is that fuckin' concept? 
"
11,2,Cartman,"You guys! I got it!  It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Well, you can call leader 'til your ass bleeds, but that doesn't make it true! 
"
15,8,Stan,"No, no, we don't hang out anymore.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Lame, yes.
"
11,10,Jimmy,"Fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun.
"
11,5,Stan,"Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me!  Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?
"
1,7,Cartman,"Well, let's go home, start eating that candy.
"
17,2,Cartman,"I'm not booing your opinion, I'm booing your report topic. No one even knows what a refewgee is. Boo, booben, boo.
"
1,4,Kyle,"Who's Middle Park?
"
9,2,Randy,"Please. Some of our kids are in there. We should have listened to you earlier.
"
8,8,Kenny,"(Yeah, totally awesome!)
"
8,7,Stan,"I I think it's wrong to call them goobacks because they're no different from us.  They're just humans trying to make their lives better. Look, it sucks that the immigrants' time is so crappy, but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time, then it's just gonna make our time crappy too. Maybe the answer isn't trying to stop the future from happening, but making the future better. 
"
18,5,Cartman,"You guys wanna see Craig's mom's bush?
"
7,10,Randy,"No, son. We... like to sleep in.
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, stop filling his head with that queer-loving propaganda.
"
15,5,Stan,"Kyle, Kyle! Look. 
"
11,3,Cartman,"Kenny!
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"...Poontang.
"
12,6,Randy,"Hey! Shelly, whoa, stop, stop!
"
2,16,Kyle,"What?!
"
14,3,Randy,"Uh that is nice! That is nice!
"
14,9,Kyle,"You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
"
8,5,Cartman,"AWESOM-O does not understand.
"
16,12,Kenny,"Stan and Kyle, you take the back entrance. Cartman and I will block him from the side.
"
15,1,Kyle,"Gahhh! 
"
3,13,Cartman,"Ahhhhhhhhh.  Ahhhhhhhhh-ahhhh. Tired, tired.
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh. Well we operate on a sixty-forty split here. Bitches have access to Medicare and now, low-income housing loans.
"
11,8,Kyle,"It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! 
"
11,6,Cartman,"Okay, let's have 'em.
"
2,8,Cartman,"I only know how to do it doggie style.
"
5,7,Butters,"Yeah, there ain't nothin' that's gettin' in my wiener through this thing? A-and it's even got a little reservoir at the end so you can... pee in it.
"
9,10,Stan,"Why do you say that?
"
7,9,Cartman,"Welcome! Welcome everyone! Please enjoy! The presentation should begin shortly.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Yeah, well I don't see why-
"
13,5,Jimmy,"I'm... I'm sorry?
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Well, I've said all I can say.  I know it's difficult, but... family... is about compromises. m'kay?  Don't lose your son over this, Mr. Garrison.  Don't lose... your son, m'kay? 
"
6,16,Randy,"Oh, Stan! 
"
11,8,Cartman,"No hey ut what, what I meant to say was ""asslicker cumballs."" And uhh,  I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! 
"
13,7,Cartman,"Yes, very nice. Apparently, these are the pirates.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Wheh? Where am I?
"
18,8,Stan,"Look, who's to say the roosters don't wanna play? I mean, they were goin' at it pretty hard.
"
1,3,Cartman,"You guys, it's just me.
"
2,5,Cartman,"Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.
"
8,14,Stan,"Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?
"
10,1,Stan,"We're not leaving without Chef.
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"Aw, do you have to take away the Christmas tree, too?
"
8,1,Stan,"Oh yeah?! Kenny! Use your ninja star!
"
12,8,Cartman,"Ting ton teetong.
"
4,2,Stan,"Uh, Butters, could we have it?
"
14,2,Stan,"God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!
"
7,9,Stan,"What the hell is that?
"
7,6,Butters,"NOOooo!
"
2,7,Stan,"Well sure. Don't you remember that time that the aliens kidnapped your little brother Ike? Now, that was scary.
"
8,10,Cartman,"He's gonna give us all Texas chili bowls. 
"
11,11,Cartman,"Come on buddy.  Get out of here!  Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight!  Fight! Fight! Right now!  Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight!  Fight!  Give him some air.  There, easy. Breathe easy. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.
"
14,8,Cartman,"I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!
"
12,4,Cartman,"There's more people viewing it!
"
2,13,Kyle,"I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
"
10,13,Cartman,"...Okay, you have one minute.
"
5,14,Butters,"Dad's a good shopper all right.
"
3,17,Kyle,"Yeah. That'll make 'em look stupid!
"
6,2,Randy,"Oh my God, look how long the lift lines are.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"This isn't the news! This a b-b-bastardized quest for ratings! Damnit, we have a journalistic responsibility to bring students the fa... the facts!  Don't you see what we've done? In our efforts to compete with Craig's small-minded show, we've made a mockery of n-nununews reporting. I remember when we all made an oath to each other, way back when started playing news reporter, that we would never let anything jeopardize our integrity! Well our integrity is jeopardized! And if we can't report news the honest way, what good is n-news reporting? 
"
17,7,Butters,"Wizard Cartman! I have news from the Internet, my lord! 
"
6,15,Stan,"Hey, uh, I need to talk to Mr. Edward, please.
"
6,17,Kyle,"Oh shut up, Cartman! Your Sweet Christmas act isn't fooling anybody!
"
4,3,Stan,"Come on, angry mob! 
"
3,9,Kyle,"This is where the elders meet. Nobody is allowed to go in there when they're having a meeting.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Ooo, is that jealousy I see in your eyes, Craig? Mmm, yes, drown me in the sweet water of your envy.
"
11,2,Cartman,"But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!
"
17,2,Randy,"Just thought I'd surprise you. And there's more where that came from.
"
8,14,Stan,"Come on, dude. 
"
5,4,Cartman,"Please Scott give me my money.
"
2,16,Cartman,"I'm not fat, I'm big-boned. Ech.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Dude, go to Hell!
"
2,7,Kyle,"What could it be? If only we knew what we were up against.
"
12,11,Kyle,"Hear that? It sounds like water.
"
2,17,Stan,"I like small businesses.
"
16,14,Kyle,"I... what? 
"
5,11,Kyle,"Yeah, I've gotta get back to Connecticut.
"
14,8,Cartman,"No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money.
"
5,11,Randy,"I dunno, it was going so fast I couldn't see it.  But I want one.
"
11,12,Cartman,"You just rest, Kyle.  Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry-  but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle?  What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream,  let's see
"
12,9,Wendy,"No! If you're really sorry, and you wanna apologize to me, then do it in front of everyone!
"
2,17,Kyle,"Killer!! 
"
3,17,Kyle,"Yeah! Next time you make up a word, don't make up one that already exists!
"
11,13,Kyle,"I'm not done yet.
"
6,6,Kyle,"Eh now,  come on, you guys, we can't take this decision lightly. Whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on.
"
5,12,Kyle,"And Cartman for being fat.
"
1,6,Kyle,"Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids.
"
3,12,Cartman,"That's only 72 shopping days left for you!
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Eh, the trip shouldn't take any longer, but I'll hand out these updated contact sheets so that your parents will know where you are, m'kay? 
"
8,9,Stan,"Dude, we gotta show our parents what Wall-Mart is doing to our town. 
"
8,11,Cartman,"Cows are on a six and O slide since Kelly's father left for that business trip.
"
3,11,Stan,"Sshh!
"
5,9,Kyle,"Jawas?
"
9,5,Stan,"I know, but listen: the finals are all sudden-death elimination, right? That means as soon as we lose one game, our season is over.
"
7,7,Cartman,"Because they're rich, greedy-ass Indians!
"
10,2,Kyle,"Dad.  Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you.
"
7,7,Stan,"Just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesn't make it yours. We grew up here. Our parents grew up here. We shop at that Wal-Mart, and eat at that Chili's. We take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks. This is not just a town, it is our way of life.
"
13,11,Stan,"Dude, are you sitting at your computer? I need you to do something for me.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?
"
5,9,Stan,"Excuse me, we wanna overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please?
"
6,16,Cartman,"That it is, I assure you. I started this business over three months ago from the ground up. I've been helping children get back at their parents ever since.
"
9,3,Kyle,"They killed Kenny!
"
13,6,Randy,"Yeah, no, we've told you everything.
"
2,3,Kyle,"Wow, these books look cool!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Lisa, this is exactly what you need! Take Butters to see a movie or something! It'll do wonders for your confidence!
"
5,12,Cartman,"What in the hell are they doing?
"
10,2,Stan,"You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow.
"
17,2,Randy,"No.
"
3,11,Cartman,"U-u-huh. I don't remember.
"
11,10,Cartman,"Yehehehesss. Yehhhs! 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Look, however hard you think it for you, it's a lot harder for him!
"
13,10,Kyle,"He's here! Vince McMahon is here! 
"
7,14,Butters,"Whoa!
"
6,15,Cartman,"Hey you guys! How's it goin'?
"
10,2,Cartman,"Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?
"
10,4,Cartman,"Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!
"
6,10,Wendy,"""The new Cold War""
"
2,16,Cartman,"Uncle Howard!
"
16,4,Cartman,"Wingstreet?!
"
6,1,Stan,"Butters?! What the hell are you doing?!
"
1,9,Stan,"Huh?!  O-oh.
"
9,14,Randy,"Ooof. There! I did it, see?! No problem!
"
3,3,Kyle,"All right. Mr. Garrison, have you ever had a friend who got a new girlfriend, and then stopped being your friend, and it pissed you off?
"
2,18,Kyle,"Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?
"
2,13,Cartman,"It is, too! 
"
16,2,Randy,"Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea.
"
16,1,Randy,"It is time for a sue-ance.
"
7,10,Randy,"You just had to be so damn stubborn, didn't you?!
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
14,5,Cartman,"I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...
"
10,8,Butters,"Well, there's only like four races to choose from-
"
4,15,Kyle,"Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!
"
10,7,Cartman,"Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?
"
6,10,Cartman,"Alright, fine! Well then, I guess we have no choice but to let you go, Tweek. But we want you to know that its been really fun. Here's a watch, and some peanuts. 
"
13,11,Cartman,"We were talking about Wales the country.
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yep. I like the food!)
"
12,13,Stan,"Who the hell is that?
"
10,6,Cartman,"Noo... NOOO!!  NOO! OW!
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"This is it: The Tree of Insight. You must go in and face what lives inside.
"
18,9,Kyle,"What do you think you're doing?!
"
11,7,Stan,"Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem.
"
7,11,Kyle,"Sorry, my mind's made up.
"
18,10,Cartman,"I am trending so much that soon I will reach... trendscendence. Like Johnny Dep, but cool.
"
6,11,Randy,"Yes, kids.  With us, now come. Home. Hoomme. 
"
4,12,Kyle,"Come on! 
"
11,13,Randy,"Ohhh.
"
2,14,Kyle,"Wow, cool!
"
10,2,Stan,"Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. 
"
4,1,Kenny,"(What the fuck for?!)
"
12,10,Cartman,"What girl is gonna see your balls?
"
1,6,Stan,"Leave me alone grampa. 
"
11,5,Stan,"I don't understand!
"
10,1,Stan,"Right. Uh, see ya.
"
6,12,Stan,"We're the kids whose names you called on your commercial last night. We're here to do the shopping spree!
"
8,9,Randy,"Hey, wait a minute, I think we just got squirreled.
"
7,1,Kyle,"The aliens are chasing us! 
"
13,6,Randy,"Hey. Hey Mexico! We said no spending the space cash yet!  What the hell are you doing?! Will some country that speaks Spanish yell at Mexico please? They're gonna ruin everything!
"
11,14,Cartman,"What?! That's bullcrap! 
"
3,3,Stan,"But we don't like her.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Wha'evah! Wha'evah!  Maury, my mom can't control me, I'm tough! Go on, aks hurh!
"
13,8,Kyle,"Well what the hell are we gonna do? Dress him up in a princess gown and, and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants? 
"
10,10,Butters,"Huh?
"
4,7,Stan,"His mom is trying all this Eastern medicine and New Age bullcrap on him, but its obviously not working.
"
5,13,Kenny,"(A football machine?)
"
13,9,Jimmy,"Go ahead, Bu-Butters. Go- go get some.
"
2,7,Randy,"How do we get our runaway children back?
"
6,10,Randy,"If you can just understand that, Stanley, you'll see that boobs hold no real power at all.
"
5,10,Cartman,"...Don't listen to that Jew, Kenny, it's totally funny.
"
3,10,Stan,"Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe.
"
2,2,Kenny,"(Roger.)
"
10,8,Cartman,"Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Re- really?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Quiet, Ms. Lopez.
"
2,18,Stan,"What are you doing here?
"
4,15,Kyle,"Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Yikes!  Ow!  Son of a bitch!
"
3,8,Randy,"Ssh-shouldn't you be hangin' out with your wife right now?
"
4,9,Stan,"Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?
"
17,3,Kyle,"You're having nightmares about the ending to World War Z again?
"
1,5,Cartman,"Hey Stan, where'd you get that black eye?
"
6,1,Cartman,"Wugh, that's a long time to wait.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Yes! She fucks me so hard!
"
12,8,Kyle,"Yeah? Well... maybe you can forget what happened, but I... can't.
"
6,15,Stan,"Okay. Let's back up.  Not literally!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Oh my God, you guys are so cisginger. Sorry I'm different, but you can just suck my clit AND my balls.
"
3,1,Stan,"You know, ""they.""
"
3,14,Mr. Garrison,"You Yankee sons of bitches!
"
1,8,Kyle,"Oh, cool.
"
12,2,Kyle,"A hundred thousand dollars?
"
5,7,Kyle,"Hey! Maybe we should ask the girls what they learned in sex ed.
"
6,1,Stan,"Did you eat only once ounce of City Wok like we told you?!
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"Okay children, let's all take our seats.  Before we get started today, Wendy Testaburger has asked to share something with the class. Wendy? 
"
11,13,Randy,"Sharon, what are the boys doing?
"
6,7,Kyle,"We don't know who else to talk to.
"
16,13,Butters,"Heyah, whatever Stan. Yeah I thought you were a butthole,  but n-now I think you're a good sneaky little butthole. 
"
12,13,Kyle,"Well, I had to see it to believe it!
"
4,4,Cartman,"Oh, thank you Low-ord! Praise Jesus!
"
4,6,Cartman,"Oh, Stan, Kyle, just the guys I wanted to see! My NAMBLA organization is having a very important benefit in my honor.
"
12,9,Cartman,"You're gonna fight me after school?
"
4,1,Cartman,"Just pass them through these little drill holes here. That's what everybody does.
"
13,13,Cartman,"You sold the movie rights to who?!
"
13,12,Stan,"Aww! Not those guys again! 
"
4,7,Cartman,"Here.  Oh, hoho. Ow.
"
12,2,Randy,"Well you boys are gonna sit and watch this! This is what really matters!
"
5,6,Cartman,"The rest of you will just have to try another day.
"
13,6,Stan,"Dad, it's over. We have to tell everyone we cheated.
"
11,7,Kyle,"He did?
"
3,14,Cartman,"Dear guys. Words cannot express how much I hate you guys. As we fight our way northward into the great unknown, only that one thing remains certain: that I hate you guys with every tired muscle in my Confederate body. We have taken Topeka, and now I must lolly the men over to Missouri. Because I will not stop until we have won it all, and you guys are my slaves. Because, I hate you guys. I hate you guys so very very much. Yours, General Cartman Lee
"
10,7,Cartman,"Mom?!
"
10,14,Stan,"Yes!
"
2,13,Kyle,"You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-
"
2,16,Stan,"'Scuse me. I wanna go with you.
"
6,10,Stan,"That would be best.
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Squirts?)
"
10,6,Cartman,"All right. Gotta be strong.  There's still a lot more treasure to go. 
"
10,9,Kyle,"Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?
"
9,3,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing?!
"
9,10,Kyle,"Huh?
"
16,4,Butters,"AAAAAHHH!
"
4,10,Cartman,"Alright. That was mostly Kenny's fault.
"
1,1,Stan,"Where? 
"
14,8,Kenny,"(Oh that fucking asshole!)  (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)
"
5,6,Cartman,"Oh, God, do you have to embarrass me even in death, Grandma?!
"
8,10,Cartman,"Okay, so now we just need to get a picture of Stan's mom naked. Cool.
"
1,7,Cartman,"What the hell is that thing?
"
10,1,Kyle,"Chef, come on!
"
13,5,Cartman,"Say Clyde, do you like fishsticks?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did.
"
16,4,Cartman,"OH GOD, IT'S GONNA KILL ME!  What the-?
"
4,15,Cartman,"What?!
"
15,7,Stan,"Where were you guys going?!
"
6,5,Kyle,"Well just hurry, Butters. You can probably make it back in time before the first commercial break.
"
12,1,Kyle,"...No. Way.
"
2,17,Stan,"Damn, dude, this place is huge! 
"
6,11,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, this is too much to take.  Mom, Dad, could you please leave me alone?
"
11,2,Kyle,"Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
"
10,8,Stan,"All right, sorry guys. So where to now?
"
7,5,Kyle,"You know God-damn well what! Now get outta here!
"
6,12,Cartman,"...I've never heard the words ""only"" and ""candy"" in the same sentence before.
"
14,9,Cartman,"Yes, it is. It's getting oranger.
"
14,5,Mr. Mackey,"They are going to sue the bejezzus out of this entire town, m'kay!
"
15,7,Stan,"Something you can get when you get older but, it's stupid. I'm not cynical. All the doctor wants is a paycheck. I went to him for help and he just stood there spouting a bunch of shit.
"
13,1,Kyle,"Well, now we know.
"
18,2,Wendy,"Why are you doing this party, Stan? Was it because you made people mad at school or... because you just wanted to be a big shot?
"
4,2,Stan,"Amazing.
"
17,9,Cartman,"Tell Bill Gates to suck my ass, Mom!  Mom?  Don't seriously tell Bill Gates to suck my ass. Tell him everything's cool and I'll call him in a little bit. 
"
5,5,Stan,"Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this thing ever gonna end? 
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"That does it! I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It's time for punishment!  Take it Mr. Slave! 
"
6,14,Randy,"He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Yeah, right.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Come on, let's go! 
"
7,9,Stan,"I can't take this much longer. Maybe we're just, not cut out to be in a band.
"
1,10,Stan,"Whoa, that was cool! 
"
6,7,Cartman,"Oh my God! The tiny underwater civilization has advanced hundreds of years.  Look! There's a library! A-and a temple! And a- who-?  Oh. They think I'm God.  Yes!!! I am god of the sea people!!! You hear that?!  I am god of the sea people!!! I am master of their great sunken empire!!!  Mo-o-om! I'm god of the sea people!
"
2,13,Cartman,"You guys, eh seriously, my back!
"
10,8,Jimmy,"All right, Eric. You can c-c-count on us.
"
2,18,Kyle,"Steve!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"You bastards!
"
4,3,Kyle,"Kenny was never gonna get his singing right anyway.
"
5,8,Stan,"They said the gas station outside of town.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Really? I wanna be a cop.
"
12,8,Cartman,"Oh my God the Chinese are here. Okay, okay I'm freaked out. I'm freaking out.
"
10,9,Kyle,"I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!
"
18,3,Cartman,"Why don't we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom?!
"
3,2,Cartman,"Stick and stones may break my bones, but I'm Jesus and you aren't.
"
17,6,Cartman,"No,  no, you were right, Kyle. I was wrong.
"
14,7,Butters,"Um come on, Towelie, it's, it's right over here.
"
3,13,Kyle,"Uh, can we sit down?
"
16,5,Timmy,"Boooo!
"
6,5,Stan,"They look fine to me. 
"
7,5,Cartman,"There. That's three more songs we've written already! Your style of music is so easy it doesn't require any thought at all!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Go have sex with yourself, asshole! I'm not that stupid! Just for that, I'm gonna spend my whole childhood eating what I want, and doin' drugs when I want!  Whatevuh! I'll do what I want!
"
18,3,Cartman,"That's actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I'm attracted to. Check the state bylaws.
"
17,3,Mr. Mackey,"Wull have you, thought about maybe writin' your feelin's down? In a poem? Uh- write a poem and give that to, g-give that to Token?
"
18,6,Kyle,"Dude, what?!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Dicktits!
"
3,4,Stan,"Tomorrow?
"
3,2,Cartman,"Oh, damnit!
"
5,6,Kyle,"But it's okay, Stan, because I finally figured it out. You see, if someone like Cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park, then there is no God. There's no God, dude.
"
16,14,Cartman,"MOM!
"
4,15,Stan,"We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing.
"
12,10,Stan,"Hey, you guys can't play here. We were here first. 
"
6,8,Randy,"Honey! Honey, come quick!
"
13,1,Kenny,"(Yeah.)  (It isn't fair I was so close to getting a blow job and I'll never get one now - this is fucking bullshit...) 
"
14,2,Stan,"Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. 
"
10,10,Randy,"What's goin' on?
"
2,18,Stan,"Hey, he's still alive.  Kyle, you okay? 
"
12,8,Stan,"You aren't alone. 
"
7,15,Cartman,"Oh Jesus, eighteen hours. We're running out of time!
"
1,8,Stan,"Oh man, they must have accidentally sent him instead of the sports watch.
"
7,8,Randy,"Not gay, Gerald, metrosexual.
"
14,11,Cartman,"I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir.
"
18,2,Stan,"We had no idea what to serve people to eat, okay?! We're gonna look stupid!
"
4,17,Kyle,"What the--
"
5,3,Cartman,"At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!
"
3,5,Kyle,"Watch out for ground eels! 
"
13,12,Stan,"All right, look, you're driving in your car, okay? And you're waiting to make a left at a traffic signal. The light turns yellow, should be your turn to go, but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming. And even when the light turns red, a guy in a BMW runs the red light so you can't make your left turn. What goes through your mind?
"
16,6,Stan,"If you signed up three friends, you got a free iPod Nano. 
"
11,7,Stan,"What?
"
13,10,Cartman,"Alright, places everyone.
"
3,13,Stan,"Alright, we'll try this again, Pip.
"
11,2,Kyle,"Is this all you brought us here to see?
"
12,3,Cartman,"What the hell?  Kenny, get out of here!
"
11,8,Kyle,"You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! 
"
5,8,Kyle,"There he is!
"
13,12,Stan,"Then you're not a fag.
"
18,5,Butters,"You promised me we wouldn't get in trouble!
"
2,12,Stan,"Divorce is stupid. 
"
11,5,Randy,"Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand.
"
4,12,Kyle,"No??
"
8,11,Cartman,"Kyle Broflovski now joins us for a look at sports. And Kyle, the girls' basketball team just can't get it right.
"
3,11,Stan,"Dude!
"
2,10,Stan,"What are you talking about?
"
18,3,Cartman,"I called dibs on Stall 1 for all recess, Craig!
"
2,11,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?
"
4,2,Cartman,"But now my mom has given us so much money that she's bankrupt, and we're poor, like Kenny.  Don't touch me, Kenny. 
"
7,12,Stan,"The guy who spoke to God and Jesus.
"
10,4,Cartman,"So long, Kyle!
"
2,2,Stan,"Ugh. I can't do it, dude. 
"
17,7,Randy,"Alright, listen up.  The mall is no longer allowing people to line up for Black Friday until Thanksgiving night.  It's okay. To hold places in line we're handing out wristbands.  Augh! Hold on! Oh God!
"
3,8,Randy,"No!
"
4,12,Cartman,"KISS MY ASS!!!  Oh, weak, you guys. Seriously weak.
"
3,6,Cartman,"What? But uh, why should I sue the school?
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, did you just take a crap on my desk?
"
1,13,Mr. Garrison,"I am not gay!
"
14,7,Stan,"There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! 
"
8,12,Cartman,"""Dude, there's Cartman. We should invite him to the party for sure.""  Fuck you Milly, fuck you Annie, fuck you Bebe, fuck you whatever your name is, and fuck you, bitch! 
"
5,10,Kyle,"This is how I look natural.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Aw, damnit!  Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! 
"
1,8,Stan,"SWEET!
"
8,13,Kyle,"I am taking it personally because Cartman is a retard! Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a- Wait, that's it. If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.
"
2,2,Stan,"Ooooogh.
"
13,14,Kyle,"No!
"
2,9,Kyle,"Nooo!
"
7,10,Kyle,"It isn't fair. Cartman's fatter than the goal.
"
15,2,Stan,"A what?
"
9,1,Stan,"Good luck. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 
"
10,6,Kyle,"Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
"
15,9,Cartman,"This is gonna be so fuckin' sweet.
"
16,11,Stan,"After all the things he said to us, he can go ahead. 
"
1,11,Wendy,"Wow.  What incredible irony.
"
2,6,Stan,"It was just a joke; we didn't think it would hurt anybody.
"
4,9,Kyle,"We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!
"
11,2,Cartman,"And now this next picture 
"
2,16,Kyle,"Dude, it's coming through the window! 
"
7,9,Kenny,"(What? Is it?)
"
2,4,Cartman,"Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence.
"
8,1,Kyle,"If we take him to the hospital, they're gonna find out what happened.
"
7,14,Stan,"Well?
"
1,2,Stan,"Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?
"
7,13,Cartman,"Gross dude! 
"
13,10,Kyle,"Irene, no! Why?
"
3,5,Cartman,"Hi, Jakov.  What the hell is that?  Who's laughing?
"
2,13,Kyle,"Go help him, Kenny!
"
4,3,Randy,"I'm sorry, boys, but Janet Reno is having them taken away on Easter Sunday. We... don't have a choice. Sorry, girls. 
"
7,10,Kyle,"That's a retarded idea, Cartman!
"
13,7,Butters,"Oh. He-he says they're in there. 
"
9,2,Cartman,"There's no more time for ideas! We have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days! Look, it's a long shot! But it's also the only shot we-  got.
"
4,8,Wendy,"This might come in handy. It says here that recently a case was brought before the South Carolina Court about their flag, and they-
"
6,4,Stan,"I don't know.
"
5,3,Cartman,"Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit.
"
16,11,Kenny,"To wit, I have found nothing wrong with this remote place, and I must admit it will be with some melancholy that I will leave this island and return home.
I saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too. She had the nicest boobs ever.
Humbly yours, Kenneth.
"
13,11,Cartman,"So that's what this has all been about?
"
1,5,Randy,"Oh, well Stan, we're uh, we're sorry we jumped to conclusions.
"
10,2,Stan,"I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
"
12,2,Stan,"She doesn't have any lips!
"
13,10,Cartman,"""Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth.""
"
11,12,Kyle,"I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
"
16,6,Cartman,"Well it's not my diarrhea's fault that you took us all ziplining, you fuckin' Jew!
"
15,10,Stan,"Yeah dude, that's pretty funny.
"
10,7,Kyle,"You'er not staying at my house either.
"
2,12,Randy,"You need to shape up, mister.
"
17,2,Wendy,"Instead of booing my opinion, why don't you make a constructive argument?!
"
6,1,Cartman,"Okay, come on, Not-Not-Kenny.
"
6,2,Kyle,"You don't even know Heather!
"
6,4,Stan,"Dude, what are you guys doing?
"
17,10,Wendy,"Mr. Mackey, I appreciate the point you're trying to make.
"
2,7,Stan,"Cartman, there's an ice cream truck sticking out of your ass. 
"
4,8,Kyle,"Yeah, you can have a drink of water. The dispenser's over there. 
"
7,8,Kyle,"...No, dude, it really isn't cool. You all turned your backs on me. You're supposed to be my best friends and you just... treated me like nothing! And now you all expect me to just forget it all and, and hang out with you again like nothing happened?
"
2,9,Stan,"Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!
"
8,1,Stan,"Yeah. Come on, ninjas.  We've got some more work to do.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Heh. What do you mean? 
"
10,14,Stan,"Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?
"
4,11,Stan,"Yeah!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Let a man take a crap!
"
8,11,Jimmy,"Wow, coming up with ideas is... hard.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Well... if you put it that way...
"
11,4,Cartman,"I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
"
1,1,Stan,"Visitors are real.
"
6,16,Butters,"Uh but Cartman! Wait!  Oh Christmas! 
"
14,9,Mr. Garrison,"What are you talking about?
"
8,8,Cartman,"It is not!
"
3,3,Kyle,"Cartman!! Wake up you fat piece of crap!! 
"
10,14,Stan,"Look, I really need my bike.
"
6,15,Cartman,"He's gone again.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Right, except for you.
"
9,5,Randy,"ЎPueblo, no bueno! ЎPueblo es muy mal! 
"
1,1,Kyle,"Fart, damn you!
"
4,17,Stan,"Presents.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Hey, what's wrong with the Jumbotron?
"
1,1,Stan,"Hey, wait. When do I get to make sweet love? 
"
8,10,Kyle,"Look, maybe he's forgiven us. I mean, we were only in preschool
"
4,1,Cartman,"Been on the inside for so long, I don't remember how to live on the outside.
"
7,7,Randy,"Well, thanks. 
"
6,8,Cartman,"Alright, now keep working with me here, it's getting a little complicated. If you eat food and crap out your butt, then maybe, if you stuck food in your butt, you crap out your mouth.  Hm?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Not really. You're just a hooker, and I need to get laid. The talent show could be over any minute.
"
8,10,Stan,"Woo, woo, woo, woo. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!  Come on, firemen! Put out the fire! 
"
14,10,Stan,"My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away.
"
14,2,Stan,"So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!
"
10,9,Butters,"What's a urinal?
"
4,15,Stan,"You know, dude, there might be something to this.
"
18,5,Cartman,"Well, you see Butters, everything worked out.  ""Oh, thank you Eric. I screwed up everything but now everyone's happy. Thanks for covering my ass.""
"
6,5,Stan,"She has to! 
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes, I know that! Why do you think I've been putting up with his farts?!
"
15,7,Kyle,"Sure.  What's up?
"
4,7,Stan,"Kyle's all better, Cartman, thanks to you!
"
6,9,Kyle,"...But you can't melt ice with a cool song, 'tardheart.
"
7,12,Randy,"All right, that does it!
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah!
"
16,14,Cartman,"They're nearby. Very safe and sound. I just might want to... alter our deal a little bit.
"
16,3,Kyle,"Copy, tango. Clear vantage point?
"
3,11,Cartman,"Yeah, and maybe Jesse Jackson will be President, heh.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Look, this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher!
"
6,9,Kyle,"We believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers..
"
5,14,Butters,"Inspector Butters in on the case, ma'am! 
"
1,2,Stan,"Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches.
"
2,18,Stan,"He wants to know where he is.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Goddammit, vegans piss me off! Now we're gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot.
"
3,4,Wendy,"Yeah! 
"
12,11,Kyle,"That is Craig. 
"
12,9,Cartman,"She is not gonna show up to a fight, dawg. I'm sure she's already trying to figure a way to get out of it.
"
5,7,Stan,"Alright, here, everybody.  Tweek, give everyone a rubber band. Hey, somebody's gotta help Timmy put his condom on.
"
4,8,Kyle,"Kenny ate all the mints, dad.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Better how, dude?
"
8,6,Kyle,"So you never met your mom?
"
14,8,Cartman,"No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! 
"
11,7,Cartman,"Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.
"
18,8,Kenny,"(I don't know. It just seems kind of... mean)
"
15,9,Cartman,"No you won't Butters!
"
3,13,Cartman,"You what? Stay at home? All day? No school?
"
1,8,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
18,10,Kyle,"Not your dad, Cartman! What's your dad got to do with this?!
"
2,15,Cartman,"Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!
"
5,1,Stan,"Jesus Christ! Another commercial? Are they ever gonna say ""shit?""
"
2,12,Kyle,"Fine!
"
10,8,Cartman,"Let's go get him! 
"
11,11,Butters,"Huh?
"
4,13,Cartman,"And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Cartman, stay away from that door!
"
1,5,Kenny,"(Hey you guys, I talked to Garrison and he told me that they're almost the same.)
"
9,14,Kyle,"He knew he had to take us all home, too, right?
"
14,8,Butters,"Feel stupid yet?
"
17,6,Butters,"Boy Eric, I sure do admire your courage to admit when you made a mistake.
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips.
"
4,2,Kyle,"Hunh. That was pretty weird.
"
5,10,Cartman,"And please buy me more chocolate guns. I'm starting to run out.
"
4,6,Kyle,"What are you talking about, fatass?
"
17,6,Kyle,"NO.
"
14,9,Kyle,"Not now, Mom. Please.
"
17,3,Cartman,"M'kay. Ahah-I'll be m'kay.
"
12,13,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
6,10,Kyle,"That was sweet, Bebe.  Now, if you just hold the rock like this, you-
"
6,6,Kyle,"You're such a fatass, Cartman!
"
17,8,Stan,"The gods will find us a way!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Then I'mo kick your ass, Tweek!
"
13,5,Cartman,"Ahaw don't cry, pal. You're gonna get me started. Anyway, what was really important for us as a team, Ellen, was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke, and not Carlos Butthole Mencia.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Yeah! Why don't you chicks go wash some dishes or get pregnant or something?!
"
16,6,Cartman,"We were in a good mood, just jokin' around, you know, mostly making fun of Kenny's herpes.
"
7,6,Kyle,"No. 
"
7,9,Cartman,"We are going to start... a Christian rock band.
"
4,14,Stan,"Helen!
"
2,11,Stan,"I don't know. 
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, I feel like I've run a marathon. 
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"NOOO!
"
1,10,Cartman,"Eheh. You got in trouble, you got in trouble.
"
1,1,Kyle,"Whoa, look at that.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Oh is, is this beef?
"
8,9,Randy,"Yeah, think about it. If I go there now, there won't be anybody else there.  I can all the bargains to myself! 
"
10,1,Stan,"Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good.
"
1,11,Wendy,"You...you can't.
"
4,1,Cartman,"Romper?
"
8,3,Kyle,"No it doesn't. 
"
3,3,Stan,"You're Chef's parents?
"
13,1,Kyle,"We came on our own 'cause our friend's purity ring is killing him.
"
16,10,Cartman,"Okay. So anyway, Kyle, you'd better watch ih-!  Kyle? God damn it.
"
1,1,Cartman,"What?
"
8,13,Cartman,"Ten percent, my balls, get lost!
"
2,12,Wendy,"I will. Kyle?
"
1,5,Kyle,"Hey, how do we know if she's pregnant?
"
3,2,Kyle,"We'll do it! We'll do it!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Ooo, ah, that's a different company.  Oh! Someone's here! We'd better run out the back! Pepite! Carlos! ­¡Vamonos!
"
7,11,Butters,"But if you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me.Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl, baby please don't go. Eh,Oo-oo-ooooo-oo girl- Eric?  Eric, is that you?
"
4,16,Stan,"How come you wanna help the fatass?!
"
9,3,Kyle,"All right, Kenny, let's go!  Kenny?  Kenny!  Don't worry, Kenny. You didn't die for nothing.  We're gonna get Wing back as our client and... and make a ton of money! I swear it to you!
"
12,7,Mr. Garrison,"Please, if you must take anyone, don't take me. These kids are worth more to you. 
"
10,7,Cartman,"Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
"
6,13,Jimmy,"You guys, this is stupid.
"
15,1,Cartman,"Yes!
"
18,7,Kenny,"(This isn't a prank, Kyle!)
"
12,14,Cartman,"Oh, who just shot me? 
"
4,7,Cartman,"Huh?
"
3,7,Cartman,"Okay, okay, hold on, I'm finding the catnip. 
"
6,9,Stan,"No, fatass! I mean a club to protect films from their directors, so they can't be messed with!
"
6,7,Butters,"I feel like a spring chicken. I'm ready to wreak havoc once again! 
"
18,1,Stan,"What?! 
"
9,10,Kyle,"Gays can get married? What??
"
10,10,Kyle,"Ike, are you okay?  Ike?  Iiiike! 
"
7,14,Stan,"I can't let Wendy go. This whole time I've been having my friends do all the talking for me. It's time I took control! 
"
3,7,Cartman,"I'm gonna get her, Kitty! Mark my words!!  SHUT THE HELL UP, KITTY!! 
"
6,10,Cartman,"Now you say, ""It puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.""
"
2,13,Cartman,"Well, I dreamt that I was a poor Vietnamese girl, and then you guys made me ride a big, scary bull, and then Leonardo DiCaprio gave me a spankin' for several hours.  Eeyy, where did you guys win all those Terrance and Phillip dolls?
"
4,16,Stan,"It's time for Carousel! Haha, your side doesn't have its book, fatass! That means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight.
"
4,10,Stan,"We have to go to Sunday school so we don't burn! 
"
13,4,Randy,"Oh my God!  Ohmygod! Stan!  Stan, we did it! Colorado Senate moves to ban queefing!
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh now, what's wrong with the planetarium?
"
12,3,Kenny,"(What the fuck did you do that for?)
"
3,6,Kyle,"What??
"
10,14,Stan,"Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Yeah, he just seems so young.
"
13,8,Cartman,"Oh my God... poor Billy Mays...
"
1,12,Cartman,"You scared the crap out of me, Ike!
"
6,15,Stan,"Fine, I give up! You wanna stay in New York?! Then go ahead! 
"
4,15,Kyle,"Good point.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Mom? Can Kenny go to Jewbilee with me?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. 
"
7,3,Cartman,"He almost spilled the beans in the counselor's office! He can't even keep the story straight! I'm telling you guys, he's weak. He's weak, and he'll be the end of all of us. 
"
14,8,Cartman,"Oh my God! Butters!  I feel kind of stupid!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Hey Bertha.
"
12,9,Mr. Mackey,"Wendy?
"
11,10,Kyle,"This is fucking retarded!
"
3,15,Stan,"I'll try
"
7,10,Stan,"Look, all Grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child. I think half of what he was angry about wasn't what you were doing, but how you were doing it.
"
10,14,Stan,"Hey. 
"
4,2,Cartman,"You guys, there's... there's no tooth fairy, you guys. There, I said it. 
"
15,1,Kyle,"(Yaaaaah!) 
"
7,14,Stan,"Then people shouldn't care about me-ehhh. Because I don't care about them. What's the point of caring if all it brings is pain?
"
10,12,Cartman,"And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?
"
4,7,Kenny,"(I know.)
"
11,6,Kenny,"(Uh oh...)
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
1,13,Kenny,"(I think if we run, try to get Eric to drop his tea)
"
9,8,Cartman,"I don't even have an uncle Roy! That was just some guy's boat I knew about.
"
5,5,Kyle,"Haaah! 
"
12,6,Randy,"Everyone, wake up!  We're here! Silicon Valley, Californee! 
"
16,8,Kyle,"This is ridiculous! Are we really going to go out there and play North Park like this?!
"
1,3,Stan,"What?! Why?!
"
9,13,Kyle,"Hang on.  Hold on a second.  I gues... I... guess... this is... goodbye, Willzy-x.  I'm gonna miss you.  Hey, don't forget me, okay? I won't forget you. 
"
14,1,Butters,"Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!
"
9,2,Cartman,"All right, in you go.
"
15,8,Cartman,"Wait what?
"
16,11,Butters,"I'm not intoxicated, you skank! I'm just ""deligerent"" because of my hapanuanalua!
"
4,3,Stan,"Dammit, now I'm never gonna have my own circus!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Hey, towel!
"
7,3,Kyle,"Yeah. That makes it even worse.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Oh-ho, great!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Wwhat's that?
"
11,5,Randy,"I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father.
"
4,13,Cartman,"You son of a bitch!  Wait a minute.  Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Hur livin' a lah, Timmih. 
"
10,12,Stan,"It's still three weeks.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls!  You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. 
"
5,8,Stan,"We're not doing it for the world, we're doing it for our video game. God, are you deaf?
"
15,11,Randy,"Then what am I supposed to do?! Run?
"
4,4,Kyle,"Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.
"
10,13,Cartman,"Garrison? But he's an asshole.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Well what are you gonna do?
"
6,2,Randy,"Let's just get out of here. 
"
4,16,Stan,"But what do the police do to them?
"
17,6,Cartman,"Kyle, are you sure?
"
7,13,Kyle,"Yeah dude. You were totally wrong.
"
10,8,Cartman,"So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!
"
8,4,Stan,"Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.
"
3,2,Stan,"See? My dad is the coolest after all.
"
8,1,Butters,"Wuhuff, woof, woof.
"
16,10,Cartman,"That's nice, you're so cool about me triggering the alarm and not knowing the password, but how do you know I'm not making it up?! I could have raped my mom twice by now!
"
4,10,Stan,"Come on! This stupid light won't change.
"
7,12,Stan,"I don't wanna be Mormon, Dad!
"
7,6,Butters,"Ah I'm pullin' on my wiener, but nothin's happening.
"
3,15,Cartman,"Jews...
"
3,3,Kyle,"I guess there's nothing we can do. Chef likes her more than us.
"
14,2,Butters,"I am?
"
1,4,Cartman,"There he goes again.
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, Mr. Hat, isn't it beautiful. 
"
10,8,Cartman,"My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters.
"
11,12,Kyle,"Aah.
"
2,7,Stan,"Yeah. There's got to be a way out of this.
"
5,10,Kyle,"You gotta come to Kenny's house with us.
"
3,15,Kyle,"I made you out of clay.
"
11,1,Cartman,"Barely! 
"
16,14,Kyle,"Dude!
"
8,5,Butters,"I'm hangin' out in LA with my robot friend
We're havin' such fun in the hot hot sun
We're two of a kind- That's me!
And my robot friend.
My robot friend.
My robot ...friend.
"
4,12,Cartman,"We're going back in time to third grade! Goodbye, teacher! Perhaps we shall see you in another year! Hahaaa! 
"
7,5,Kyle,"Aw, stop it, Cartman! Your hand hand doesn't need to breathe!
"
12,8,Cartman,"I handed out fliers, called together meetings, but it's like... everyone's turning a blind eye. The Chinese are taking over the world and nobody's doing anything! It's up to you and me, Butters. We have to stop the Chinese now.
"
15,4,Randy,"Let's see how the American government likes it when we shut down their Federal Express! 
"
1,7,Kyle,"Well, not really, except that Kenny keeps eating people's brains.
"
18,1,Cartman,"Kyle, you're not hearing me! The trademark has been pulled! We can do whatever we want!
"
14,7,Timmy,"Timmih.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Stem cells, numbnuts!
"
9,9,Cartman,"How is the incubation shield coming Clyde?
"
5,7,Stan,"That does it! Attack! 
"
5,2,Jimmy,"What?  Hey wait a minute! This is crazy! You can't do this!
"
3,13,Kyle,"Ooww!
"
1,1,Wendy,"Whatever, dude.
"
9,3,Cartman,"We'll go to LA with your wife. All she has to do is go on the show, do all the performing, make all the money, and leave the rest to us. 
"
1,4,Kyle,"Hey Stan, Ah- I'm open, I think.
"
11,7,Cartman,"Thirty was hard enough.
"
2,15,Stan,"Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!
"
16,1,Jimmy,"What's happening now?
"
14,14,Cartman,"Oy! Bebebebebebebe.
"
11,1,Cartman,"Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed him up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!
"
2,4,Kyle,"How's it going?
"
13,3,Stan,"Nononono excuse me! I don't understand! How can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars?!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Yes, well, it's interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.
"
10,1,Kyle,"...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?
"
6,8,Stan,"You've had five, dude!
"
6,17,Cartman,"This is Baghdad? God, what a shithole!  I mean, oh wow, these poor unfortunate people.
"
8,7,Stan,"I mean, maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future, then, then the future won't be so bad, and, these immigrants won't need to come back here looking for work.
"
2,17,Kyle,"Well, how about we just say, ""corporates should be stopped""?
"
7,4,Stan,"Kenny, no- ohhh! Awww.  Awww, now we lost two in our study group!
"
11,10,Stan,"...What do you know about the leprechaun?
"
1,4,Stan,"Sparky! Where are you?! Where could he be?
"
1,10,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
16,10,Kyle,"And that applies to all of us, doesn't it? Even though it's convenient to have things done for you, sometimes it's best to deal with it yourself. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"AGH!  DAAGGHHHH!!
"
3,4,Kyle,"Remember, Tweek: punch hard, punch low.
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"That'll be wonderful, won't it Mr. Hat.
"
14,3,Stan,"Hey it looks different.
"
4,2,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
10,8,Cartman,"Get out of here, asshole!
"
6,14,Butters,"Where is Mr. Hat, sir?
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh! 
"
8,8,Stan,"B-bani-banishment?
"
16,4,Cartman,"Bobo?! Bobo, no!  Wha- 
"
3,3,Mr. Garrison,"A succubus is a woman sent from Hell to suck the life out of a man.
"
11,9,Stan,"You're not number two!
"
8,13,Cartman,"Oh, didn't you hear, Kyle? I used my new psychic abilities to catch the serial killer. And I made a hundred bucks! 
"
7,1,Cartman,"That's because I was having these bogus nightmares all night long.
"
6,6,Jimmy,"Hey, I-I'm gonna need some help getting in the log, fellas.
"
12,11,Kyle,"Whoa, I don't think anyone's been in here for centuries
"
15,2,Kyle,"Butters! Butters, is everything okay?
"
9,3,Cartman,"Your gift of hope is a great deduction. 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Me too.
"
18,8,Stan,"Hey, how about this little guy?
"
4,8,Wendy,"Okay. Now, in order for us the debate to change the South Park flag, we will need to do a lot of research. Now, my plan is to divide up into three research teams. We will present our arguments based on things that w-
"
2,9,Cartman,"Selling T-shirts kicks ass!
"
7,6,Cartman,"Hello, sir. South Park Junior Detectives. We're wondering if you have any crimes to be solved, for a dollar.
"
2,15,Cartman,"Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!
"
18,3,Randy,"Lorde Lorde Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde I am Lorde. I am L- I am Lorde. I am Lorde. Lorde Lorde Lorde.
"
11,13,Stan,"Dude, we are total rock stars now!
"
6,4,Stan,"Well, I guess we learned somethng today: it's wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated, but if you don't eat meat at all you break out in vaginas.
"
18,3,Stan,"...What?
"
12,6,Stan,"Dad?
"
2,10,Randy,"Stan?
"
9,6,Butters,"Yeh you're still here.
"
5,5,Butters,"Wow, yuh-you guys ore gonna see Terrance and Phillip Live?
"
15,8,Stan,"Because of aliens? 
"
4,10,Kenny,"(Yow!) 
"
2,18,Cartman,"Well, he shouldn't have called me fat. 
"
9,1,Kyle,"I know. I deserve it.
"
16,7,Cartman,"No time! NOOOOOOO!
"
9,7,Cartman,"I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you're a good listener.
"
16,11,Butters,"What's ""saimin""?
"
2,9,Kyle,"Dude, no one even listened to me.
"
5,1,Cartman,"What a stupid voice.
"
14,4,Kyle,"That's it Cartman, I'm outta here!  Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! 
"
3,13,Kyle,"No no. I mean, go with me.
"
13,7,Cartman,"Or are you lying now? So many lies, Kyle, you can't even keep them straight. You just couldn't stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home.
"
6,5,Kyle,"The TV left.
"
1,11,Kyle,"So how'd your date with Ms. Ellen go?
"
18,8,Cartman,"You feel bad for the roosters?
"
8,9,Randy,"All right, let's not make that mistake again.
"
14,9,Cartman,"That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the tree! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it!  Did you see the scratch, Kenny?!
"
5,7,Butters,"Ha-a how come I gotta go first?
"
7,11,Butters,"Wow... Eric, I can never thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
"
10,7,Stan,"I'm not shooting anybody.
"
16,6,Kyle,"Well? How was it, Cartman?
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"We've done it, Mr. Hat. Airline companies be damned. We've invented a whole new mode of transportation! Get some investors on the phone!  Well what are you waiting for?!
"
16,12,Cartman,"Uhhh what are you supposed to be, Butters?
"
2,3,Kyle,"Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.
"
9,3,Stan,"Oh, you're interested in hiring our client?
"
5,11,Kyle,"We-ull, some fish would be great if it isn't too much trouble.
"
2,11,Kyle,"Why?
"
13,1,Cartman,"Grey's Anatomy?! Kenny! What kind of douchebag garbage are you watching?!
"
7,14,Butters,"Well yeah, but, but, hey,  hey Lexus? Well I was thinking, well, I was thinking that we should- go do something sometime.
"
6,1,Kyle,"That penisbutt didn't lose weight eating sub sandwiches. He lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised.
"
6,11,Randy,"The news says that at your age you aren't safe with us, son. You have to get out of here before we abduct you.
"
8,6,Cartman,"Yeah? 
"
14,5,Stan,"Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.
"
14,1,Stan,"What are you guys doing?
"
15,9,Butters,"Viva la Meheeco!
"
6,1,Kyle,"Wow, that was pretty good.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Oh uh, Kyle has it. 
"
7,9,Butters,"Ow...
"
1,1,Stan,"Okay, okay, let's ditch school and go find him.
"
10,1,Kyle,"Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oh yes! And the best part is... they're coming here, to my house. And it's gonna be sooo funny!!  Oh Jesus, that's probably them now! Okay, you guys, just play it cool, just play it-, just-sshh. No, sshh, you guys, sshh.  Just- okay  No.  Okay, okay, no, you guys, sh, sh. 
"
3,5,Mr. Garrison,"I'll keep it at my house.
"
9,2,Stan,"Right, so how do we get back at them?
"
15,7,Randy,"Because I'm unhappy, okay?! I've been unhappy for a long time! 
"
2,16,Stan,"Dude, this is pretty fucked up right here.
"
1,5,Kyle,"Well, what about our pot-bellied elephant?
"
12,10,Mr. Garrison,"They're all over the place!
"
4,14,Timmy,"Heh-aaaah, Timmih!
"
2,18,Kyle,"Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!
"
11,7,Cartman,"Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny.
"
1,4,Stan,"I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn't seem evil.
"
18,1,Butters,"Oh no!
"
8,1,Butters,"It hurts! It hurts! 
"
15,7,Stan,"Please, Kyle, I can change my attitude. I promise. Let me go to the movies with you.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Butters.
"
2,12,Randy,"Well, you never know. Maybe--
"
6,8,Cartman,"You sonofabitch, Kyle!! I hate you!! 
"
12,10,Stan,"This is our Peruvian flute band's turf, you got that?! 
"
11,11,Kyle,"No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! 
"
10,1,Cartman,"...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex.
"
13,10,Cartman,"You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!
"
11,11,Cartman,"Zap him again!  Do it!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Dude, when he gets out of Juvenile Hall, he's gonna wanna kill us!
"
4,3,Kyle,"Hey, we should start our own Cirque du Cheville.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go.
"
1,1,Cartman,"Oh!! You guys, my ass, seriously..!
"
8,6,Cartman,"You guys better not be trying to Bogart my friend away!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Jury found me innocent, Kyle!
"
2,18,Stan,"Dude!
"
4,6,Kenny,"(No! Daddy!) 
"
7,7,Randy,"Yeah, well, maybe we should- ...wait. Twenty-six thousand dollars??
"
9,6,Cartman,"I can't! Don't you understand?!
"
3,16,Kenny,"(A little.)
"
16,12,Butters,"Okay, Stan. Enjoy the Monster Mash. 
"
9,5,Stan,"Gay.
"
14,4,Stan,"Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Ech! You see, guys? This is why Jews can't be ninjas! They've got no spine!
"
1,10,Mr. Mackey,"Well-uh. Why do you suppose that is?
"
13,2,Cartman,"What?!
"
6,4,Kyle,"Stan! It worked!
"
1,3,Stan,"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman's missing!
"
9,12,Kyle,"Yeah. See ya. 
"
11,14,Kyle,"Hrrgh! 
"
2,10,Kyle,"Could we go home now, Ma?
"
18,7,Kenny,"(You see? Look at all these piles of food. He must have been here for days!)
"
1,9,Kyle,"Mookie-stinks?
"
3,12,Stan,"Don't worry. We're about to go get 'em back.
"
7,13,Cartman,"Sure you don't, Kyle. Oh, and neither do I. Oh, I know what you're gonna say next. You're gonna say, ""How about none of us show up tomorrow to do it?"" And then I'm supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial. That's Serbian Jew double bluff and it ain't  gonna  work  on  me  ha  ha  ha . Only one of us can be in the commercial, gentlemen. The game... is on. 
"
4,6,Stan,"Oh, man, that's terrible.
"
7,8,Butters,"Tootaloo, Connor. See ya after classies.
"
8,4,Butters,"Yeah well, you tell that to their families. 
"
1,6,Cartman,"Ohhh, God, No!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"And the winner is... the Germans!  Uhhh... I guess unfortunately the Germans could not be with us tonight. So I will accept this award on their behalf.  Auf Wiedersehen.  And now, for the Kathy Griffin Award. The Kathy Griffin Award will be given each year to the person who is most likely to actually show up to receive the Kathy Griffin Award. And the winner is...  Tyler Perry. 
"
8,3,Cartman,"What?
"
7,13,Kyle,"That sound perfectly reasonable.
"
1,2,Kenny,"(Oh no!) 
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad, you can't drive! Your license is suspended, remember?! If you get pulled over again, you're gonna go to jail for ten years!
"
3,17,Stan,"Whoa! Mr. Mackey and Mr. Hat are fighting. 
"
5,2,Cartman,"Hey, Butters.
"
7,5,Kyle,"Well, there you go, fatass! I hope you learned your lesson.
"
12,6,Randy,"One more thing?  Ooooyeah... 
"
1,5,Cartman,"Hey!  I'm taking my pig and…Screw you guys!  I'm going home!  This whole idea's stupid anyway.
"
13,4,Randy,"Oh yeah. Yeah, that's really funny!
"
14,2,Cartman,"The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.
"
8,6,Randy,"Mr. Jefferson, this is highly inappropriate!
"
1,10,Stan,"Hey, Jesus.
"
4,4,Stan,"I've got ADD.
"
13,11,Cartman,"You don't have a TV show anymore, Captain, so you can just suck my Japanese-imprisoned balls! 
I'm in a Japanese prison Lawd. 
Japanese balls got me down.
"
11,13,Stan,"Yeah?
"
1,2,Cartman,"Here it is, my big moment of fame.
"
11,9,Randy,"I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Girls volleyball?  Uhhh, sorry, we're actually busy.
"
4,16,Randy,"Uh, excuse me, but my wife and I honestly never touched our child.
"
11,14,Wendy,"When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-
"
4,6,Kyle,"Bleuh-leuh-leuh-leuh-leuh.
"
15,4,Butters,"A conspiracy?
"
1,4,Kenny,"(No, check his penis) 
"
11,4,Butters,"Hey, I was about to win!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"N-no, I do NOT want to take off my shirt and kiss
"
16,6,Cartman,"It was a miracle. He came to save us and take us back home.
"
7,3,Cartman,"...But he's not gonna get in trouble.
"
15,6,Butters,"Sure.
"
2,12,Stan,"We're going as fast as we can!
"
11,11,Butters,"No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!
"
18,5,Butters,"Oh he'll know. You can hear it take off.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Medium spicy. 
"
4,4,Stan,"Let's watch something else.
"
17,10,Butters,"You did! You said Kim was short, fat, and hairy with big feet and she's a hobbit!
"
1,11,Kenny,"(Yeah, they totally kick ass at spanking!)
"
12,9,Wendy,"You unbelievable bastard. You beat me but you won't stop.
"
4,12,Kyle,"I can't wait until the teacher yells at us this time, and we all tell her to suck our balls!
"
5,6,Kyle,"So, how are things going at Cartman's theme park?!
"
9,6,Butters,"Broke fence...
"
13,7,Kyle,"Yeah? Okay, and you checked with Kenny and Token? He's not just staying at their houses?
"
16,14,Kyle,"Sure you do!
"
4,12,Butters,"Huhuh, look at all this stuff.
"
8,9,Stan,"Dude, we have to go!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Our lives have not been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you! 
"
6,12,Stan,"Kyle figured out a way to get our winning ticket stub back from Kenny!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Well, we're glad you see it our way, fellas. So can we join your g... group?
"
16,8,Randy,"Yeah, we're your parents! We can't tell you what to do!
"
3,2,Randy,"What?
"
3,16,Kyle,"Ike, I don't know what to do. All the guys are getting their periods, and I don't think I am. I can't be the last one to get it. I just can't!
"
12,6,Randy,"How. You won't have Internet. 
"
2,12,Wendy,"Hi, guys. 
"
10,8,Cartman,"Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.
"
4,16,Stan,"He's right, dude. Things were a lot better with our parents around.
"
1,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey?
"
3,6,Cartman,"I thought you weren't supposed to run around with scissors.
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh I'm sorry, mom.
"
4,14,Cartman,"Alright, alright! Just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal! I'll take care of everything. 
"
5,9,Cartman,"So that's what this is all about?
"
6,8,Stan,"...Like ...money? What?
"
11,2,Kyle,"Wait, wai- I can't let this happen.  Butters.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here.
"
3,10,Cartman,"C'mon.
"
16,9,Cartman,"Dude, it's sweet. Did you know they make access for mobility scooters everywhere? I can seriously go from my bed to Wall-Mart and never have to touch the floor, once. 
"
17,2,Randy,"Yeah-hah! 
"
3,9,Kenny,"(What the fuck are we doing?)
"
13,5,Cartman,"Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We've got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!
"
15,2,Jimmy,"...and the winner for best comedy performance in a movie is...  Ben Stiller! Come on up here, Ben.  Is Ben Stiller here?  No? Huh... I guess B-ben Stiller could not be with us, so I'll accept this award on his behalf.  And the award for funniest correspondents dinner speech goes to...  President Obama!  Is President Obama here? No? Ah I guess we'll just accept this award on his behalf.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good! 
"
6,1,Kyle,"Aw, just forget the whole thing then!
"
4,7,Stan,"Die? But... Kyle's my best friend. In the whole world.
"
5,1,Stan,"Well, yeah, but I don't think that we knew ""curse word"" meant... curse word.
"
16,2,Stan,"Yeah! Here's one. 
"
1,10,Stan,"Oh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Do you know where they meet? We've already tried the rec center and the library.
"
12,6,Randy,"Right, Starbucks!
"
16,6,Cartman,"If I crap in the woods, the blood will attract beavers, Kyle!
"
14,9,Stan,"Dude.
"
1,4,Stan,"Oh, there you are dude. How's it going?
"
6,14,Kyle,"Hey guys, can we talk to you? 
"
10,8,Stan,"Dad? Not now!
"
6,17,Kyle,"Mom! Dad! We rode on Santa's sleigh!
"
6,16,Butters,"Mm. Uhm, maybe I used a little too much silver.
"
8,11,Stan,"It's... it's the greatest show of all time.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
"
13,10,Jimmy,"Aha! I thought I would find you here, Triceratops!
"
18,1,Kyle,"What?! Tell us!
"
12,12,Randy,"I know what to do!  Losers! Looosers!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Huh! Timmih! T-Timmih!
"
12,9,Wendy,"I'm not going to hurt you.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you had to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance!  ""Tolerate"" means you're just putting up with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!
"
8,11,Jimmy,"But this is real news!
"
7,13,Kyle,"No dude, get away!
"
1,7,Cartman,"Eh, shit...
"
8,6,Cartman,"Sure, maybe Mr. Jefferson's a little different. But that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood. What's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child.
"
8,10,Butters,"Mom, Dad, you gotta open the door right now! You've gotta open it-  Oh, hey! Trent Boyett Gosh I... haven't seen you in a while.
"
4,4,Cartman,"So it's decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us.  Hooray.  Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.
"
2,10,Cartman,"Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?
"
15,14,Butters,"Now that Kenny's gone,  your household actually has the lowest income.  I'm sorry, pal.
"
4,6,Stan,"Dude! I think these guys mean to have sexual encounters with us!
"
3,4,Kyle,"Tweek?
"
17,2,Butters,"Murder porn?
"
18,8,Randy,"Because people didn't understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer.
"
3,2,Cartman,"...Really?
"
16,4,Cartman,"It's trying to get in! Where the hell are you guys?
"
5,10,Kyle,"Blew a funny fuse?
"
13,7,Butters,"Neato!
"
3,13,Stan,"You suck now, Kyle! 
"
6,10,Cartman,"Good. Now, now put the lotion back in the basket!
"
7,3,Cartman,"Aw man, that was sooo awesome! 
"
2,17,Kyle,"Damnit! What the hell is wrong with you, Tweek?!
"
8,1,Cartman,"So if we make Butters up to look like a dog...
"
16,2,Stan,"I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
"
4,16,Kyle,"What's Cuba?
"
16,10,Cartman,"Yeah Mom! There's dangerous people trying to screw us both!
"
14,11,Stan,"It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! 
"
9,5,Stan,"Yes! It's over! It's over!
"
18,3,Butters,"Oh no you don't! You've gotta use the cissy bathroom!  Well go on, cissy! 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Yeah, but where's that crappy song coming from? Could you turn that off? 
"
4,7,Butters,"Oh well, we're busted. 
"
7,4,Stan,"No, you just have to study.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Jesus, don't you guys have any toys? First you put on the black ski mask  and use the torch to cut a hole in the roof. 
"
18,8,Randy,"It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.
"
1,10,Kyle,"Wow!
"
6,9,Stan,"Uh-look, if the Beatles went back and updated their White Album every few years, what would we have now?
"
8,10,Kyle,"That's nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out I've been lying for five years!
"
16,13,Randy,"I know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets. I bet they all feel pretty stupid now. 
"
8,12,Wendy,"Who's Paris Hilton?
"
18,7,Kyle,"You should probably listen to him, dude.
"
1,7,Cartman,"Kill her Stan!
"
3,2,Randy,"Hey!
"
14,11,Cartman,"Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! 
"
11,10,Stan,"Hello?
"
10,1,Stan,"NO!!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Can you believe this asswipe, Timmy?
"
5,13,Mr. Mackey,"You didn't do anything wrong boys. We just need to talk to you. Have a seat.  Boys, uh... your little friend Kenny went to the hospital last night, m'kay.  And well, he's pretty sick. 
"
9,14,Stan,"Praise Christ.
"
2,7,Stan,"Hey, it's happening again.  It's a ice cream truck. Now do you believe this, Cartman?
"
3,16,Kenny,"(...What?)
"
12,1,Kyle,"I'm going to break everything that you own! 
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Parece que anoche no regresaron al hotel, hmbien. (Well, they never came back to the hotel last night...)
"
8,3,Stan,"Mel Gibson is fucking crazy dude!  Wait! There's his wallet! 
"
8,8,Kyle,"What? Y-you gotta vote, dude. Haven't you seen the Rock the Vote stuff or, or Puff Daddy's Vote or Die?!
"
3,12,Stan,"Well, come on! We can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts! 
"
9,6,Stan,"All right.
"
1,11,Mr. Garrison,"Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Bluuuch...Oh, stop, that movie was terrible!
"
2,18,Stan,"Help me chip some of the ice away.
"
2,9,Wendy,"Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie? 
"
18,7,Butters,"They did it!  They figured it out!  Whoopie!
"
13,14,Cartman,"...because I was so happy when I seen that movie.
"
10,13,Butters,"But, yyou're telling me not to go with you.
"
14,2,Stan,"God-damnit!
"
2,15,Kyle,"Chef.
"
17,8,Butters,"Whatoyou mean?
"
6,16,Cartman,"What?
"
4,15,Cartman,"You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!
"
5,2,Stan,"Timmy, come on! We're gonna be late for Scouts! 
"
11,12,Cartman,"Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick.
"
11,2,Kyle,"...Idiot.
"
5,12,Cartman,"Hey, you changed your clothes, Token.
"
10,1,Stan,"I'll get it. 
"
5,6,Cartman,"What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!
"
5,1,Cartman,"I knew it! Meecrob!  Meecrob is a curse word! God must hate it as much as I do!
"
1,10,Cartman,"Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.
"
15,4,Butters,"Hang on, he's coming back out. There he is. Who's a little guy?
"
1,12,Stan,"Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.
"
14,9,Cartman,"I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!
"
7,7,Randy,"Now, Eric, they're called Native Americans, remember? Show some respect.
"
17,8,Cartman,"Alright, stop, stop, stop!  This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there's gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots! Scott Malkinson has diabetes, so we hit him in his weak spot! 
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"HWAAAAHHH! Airline motherfuckerrrs! You pieces of shiiit! Cocksucking sons of bitch airlines! 
"
8,8,Cartman,"Giant Douche sucks!
"
1,13,Cartman,"You're my dad, Chef. Chief Running Water said - you got together with my mom at the Drunken Barn Dance.
"
8,10,Kyle,"Totally, dude, let's play Fireman.
"
10,7,Butters,"Kill your mom?
"
16,14,Jimmy,"Yeah, I love when Morgan Freeman explains stuff.
"
16,11,Butters,"Well if you ask me, the only good haole is a dead haole! With a, with a stick up his butthole, and his wiener cut off! Rraahhhh!
"
5,8,Cartman,"Kyle, I think you underestimate Okama GameSphere.
"
7,3,Cartman,"Put more clay on the balls.
"
11,2,Cartman,"All right, that's good.  Okay, open your mouth, Butters?  That's good, just like that.
"
1,1,Stan,"Okay, Cartman, you can stop farting fire now.
"
7,2,Timmy,"Timmih!!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Oh shit!  Butters! Butters, where are you now?
"
4,15,Butters,"I'll throw in a dollar!
"
3,5,Stan,"Wow!
"
18,7,Cartman,"THAT'S RIGHT! And you'd better stop messin' around, Butters, so I can help you out of this! Because you know how I said if you die in virtual reality you die in real life?
"
10,10,Kyle,"Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman.
"
8,4,Mr. Garrison,"Aww, yeah.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Then it's settled. Oh, I have such a great mother.  Such a beautiful mother.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Wow, cool!
"
4,12,Timmy,"Eh, Timmih.
"
13,12,Stan,"Aw crap!
"
10,8,Randy,"Who are you?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Ok-Okay, okay.
"
18,5,Butters,"I should have never listened to you! Ah I should have known this would get out of hand!
"
9,12,Randy,"Well, we CAN'T leave you alone because YOU won't come out of the closet!
"
15,11,Randy,"Shelly! 
"
16,8,Randy,"Jesus Christ! Yes, I would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team!
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh no, that won't happen, Dad.
"
4,10,Kyle,"Well, you guys can do what you want! I'm going down to that church to confess my sins and eat crackers! And I'm taking Ike with me! 
"
10,14,Stan,"Oh boy.
"
2,7,Cartman,"What?
"
9,9,Cartman,"Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I'm afraid it's true.  I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera . I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.
"
3,17,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
1,1,Stan,"What's gonna be for lunch today, Chef?
"
6,16,Stan,"I've been told a lot of things about pot, but I've come to find out a lot of those things aren't true! So I don't know what to believe!
"
9,13,Butters,"Oh hamburgers! What is that?? 
"
4,2,Timmy,"Timmy!
"
5,10,Cartman,"Jimmy! Thank God! Get in here! 
"
4,1,Stan,"Noo problem!
"
10,7,Cartman,"Tha... thank you?
"
2,8,Kyle,"Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?
"
5,7,Butters,"Nope. It looks like you're just supposed to roll it over your wiener.  ""If used properly, latex condoms are effective against pregnancy, AIDS and other studzes""
"
5,10,Cartman,"Oho, you guys, you guys! Oh my God.  Okay, okay, so get this, get this: The milk company calls me, right?  And they call me and say that two people from Wisconsin... saw the picture of Kenny on the milk carton, and they think it's their kid. 
"
16,4,Cartman,"What? What was that? Butters? Token?!  Oh Jesus Christ! You guys?! Aghgh!  You guys?! GUYS!
"
4,7,Stan,"Dude, you're my best friend. I don't want you to die until I do.
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"I can do this. I have to do this.  Hello. Dad.
"
4,17,Cartman,"Yeah, ham.
"
6,6,Kyle,"Hm, I think he took that pretty well, I think.
"
9,12,Stan,"Uh what do I have to do?
"
11,3,Cartman,"Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
"
5,14,Butters,"I don't know. But it wasn't the movie theater at the mall. No, it was that, really old theater downtown. The Studcat.  I didn't know it was open. 
"
1,3,Kyle,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!
"
13,1,Cartman,"This whole thing is a freaking sham! I see what you're doin' now! You're tryin' to sell sex to young girls and then confuse them by  teh- ...tehhhh 
"
11,7,Kenny,"(What are you gonna do?)
"
6,5,Cartman,"We don't give two craps about Russell Crowe, Chef. We just wanna see the trailer about the new Terrance & Phillip movie, that's supposed to play during the commercials.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Ugh. Oh yeah?! I'll kick you in the nuts! Ugh. I'll kick you in the nuts! I'll kick you in the nuts!
"
10,10,Cartman,"Praise Christ! Let's go! 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Seventeen. 
"
8,4,Stan,"We're gonna get served on Saturday, aren't we?
"
5,2,Randy,"That's better.
"
2,5,Kyle,"I caught it! I caught it!
"
10,8,Stan,"Dad!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Butters get back to my room! The veracrosses are destablilzing!
"
16,8,Randy,"Yeah, yeah! Let's do that! We got the economy in the toilet, a big election coming up, but this country's number one priority should be making football safer! 
"
6,10,Cartman,"It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.
"
18,2,Kyle,"A band! Holy shit, Stan! Didn't you say your dad knows somebody who knows Lorde?
"
14,10,Stan,"Mr. Mackey.
"
14,10,Stan,"Shut up!
"
11,3,Kyle,"Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?!  It was me.
"
14,10,Kyle,"What's it say?
"
5,2,Jimmy,"... Gee, you didn't have to do that. I mean, I understand why you've been jealous of my talent.  If you work at it, maybe you could be as... handi-capable as I am, huh?  Wow, a parka.  You-you didn't have to do that, Tim-Tim.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Noo! No!
"
1,1,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, really, Kyle? What is it this time? Another prostate tumor?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Dude, Toby, are you over at Lawrence's?
"
8,10,Stan,"We, we got it. 
"
18,1,Kyle,"It... doesn't... quite roll off the tongue.
"
15,6,Butters,"Wuh you mean the sha-sushi restaurant? Ih-it's right over there.
"
11,7,Stan,"Yeah, it's all set.
"
3,11,Cartman,"No. Dude, I've seen this on TV. They shine that light in your face, and then they try to get you to tell them stuff by squeezing your balls really hard.
"
7,11,Butters,"Well, sure I can!
"
11,1,Cartman,"Race war! Come on! Race war!
"
16,2,Kyle,"What's he doing?
"
9,3,Stan,"Sylverster Stallone wants Wing to sing at his son's wedding tomorrow! He's gonna pay her four thousand dollars!
"
2,3,Kyle,"Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
"
2,12,Kyle,"When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
5,8,Stan,"Where is our Okama GameSphere?
"
9,14,Randy,"...Oh I gotta pee. Hand me that empty bottle, Stan.
"
4,9,Stan,"Dad, I was just a--
"
1,1,Stan,"Hey look,  I think Kenny's okay.
"
4,8,Stan,"Do you think they should change the flag?
"
2,12,Stan,"""Dare!""
"
13,6,Randy,"All right you guys, we've gotta get rid of Finland.
"
16,7,Kyle,"Just because two people are the same race doesn't mean they belong together, you fat racist piece of fucking garbage!
"
14,4,Cartman,"Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too.
"
7,14,Butters,"Well, I was hopin' to go see her right now. You can come alone.  But don't embarrass me or nothin'.  I'm sure she'll be real nervous to impress you.
"
4,1,Stan,"It's Cartman!
"
5,8,Cartman,"We shouldn't have this many responsibilities! We're children!
"
9,11,Stan,"You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers. I think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another, and we shouldn't be threatened by those differences. I mean, Cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night.
"
7,15,Kyle,"Word!
"
17,3,Cartman,"The other way to stop the outbreak. Token isn't the only Patient Zero. The outbreak won't happen if... we shoot George Zimmerman. We have to get to Florida!
"
11,9,Stan,"That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit.
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"I can't help it. I'm a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world.
"
2,13,Stan,"You okay, dude?  Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?
"
7,14,Kyle,"Dude, you need to snap out of this! So Wendy left you for Token. What are you gonna do? Just be miserable your whole life?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Token.  Dude, dude. Dude.
"
1,13,Stan,"Dude! I can't wait to win that $10,000 on America's Stupidest Home Videos. I'm gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.
"
7,2,Kyle,"Cartman, just stay out of it.
"
4,4,Kyle,"No, not at all. 
"
8,3,Stan,"Dude, can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you?
"
10,3,Cartman,"You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!
"
6,5,Kyle,"Ugh! We're gonna end up watching this whole retared Russell Crowe show!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Your daughter could die tomorrow, and then what?!
"
1,6,Cartman,"Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal. 
"
4,16,Kyle,"Sure. 
"
11,14,Cartman,"All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right. She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her.  This is what I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail"" 
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh, crap!
"
3,6,Cartman,"This is ridiculous!
"
5,4,Cartman,"How to get Scott Tenorman back!
"
18,10,Randy,"Shelley? Um, I'm Lorde.  All the music you've really been into has been me. Nobody in the family knew except for your mother. And your brother, and your grandpa. But Michael Jackson's hologram is here and we're going to set the record straight, Okay? Love you. Whew, that was hard.
"
6,1,Cartman,"Lose weight and make money... I tell you this is gonna be the greatest thing that Butters has ever done.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Yeah. So bad.
"
12,9,Stan,"I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you. 
"
5,6,Stan,"Aw, crap.
"
5,5,Stan,"No, dude, we really, really do.
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"I think you're the loony one in this room.  Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo.
"
18,2,Kyle,"Yeah, it's going to be this weekend.
"
13,10,Stan,"Why did they have us put on long underwear.
"
1,12,Stan,"Oooh.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Why, you son of a bitch! 
"
7,13,Cartman,"Jesus Christ! HAAAA!
"
4,9,Randy,"Now, give it to me, 'cause...
"
17,7,Cartman,"God these guys are such dorks!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Food!
"
12,9,Stan,"Dude, we never thought you were cool.
"
11,11,Butters,"Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key.
"
10,13,Cartman,"And what was that purpose again?
"
7,11,Kyle,"Who said I'm inviting you? 
"
3,2,Stan,"(Okay, okay, just go away!) 
"
11,11,Stan,"Imagina-he-hey-
"
5,8,Mr. Garrison,"What the? 
"
9,8,Cartman,"...Aw man.
"
11,13,Stan,"Man...
"
3,8,Randy,"Well, let's get back into the party and see what everyone is doing. 
"
12,11,Stan,"No no, listen to me. The Peruvian flute bands were keeping the guinea creatures away. Whatever is happening to the world is happening because you guys got rid of all the flute bands.
"
4,14,Timmy,"Timmih! 
"
1,6,Stan,"Yeah...
"
10,13,Cartman,"How about a robot? How much for the robot?
"
8,5,Butters,"Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh?  Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what's called a hesiated colon, which means I sometime can't control my sphincter.
"
17,2,Cartman,"Alright, we've gotta do something.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
15,5,Kyle,"I'm sorry, can I come back in just a little bit?
"
17,7,Cartman,"...Nnnoo. Guys, when I said we're gonna get the next gen gaming systems, I was obviously talking about XBoxes.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Okay, okay, hold your horses! God!  Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature!
"
15,8,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one!  So everything worked out.
"
4,16,Butters,"Oo what the heck are you talkin' about?
"
13,7,Cartman,"Nice. And with a yo ho ho!
"
3,11,Cartman,"She bought it.
"
18,2,Wendy,"Oh wow, I'm shocked.
"
1,13,Cartman,"My goodness, that's a lovely dress you are wearing, Polly Prissy Pants.
"
7,7,Mr. Garrison,"We're not moving, assfaces!
"
6,12,Kyle,"Why would they play such a cruel joke on us?
"
10,2,Stan,"Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend.
"
3,11,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, for Pete's sake, what have you bastards done now?!
"
4,12,Kyle,"Hey! We're fourth-graders now, too!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Why you be trippin', Mom? I mean  come on. I'm finally a part of something, very much.
"
6,14,Kyle,"Uh, a bear?
"
7,4,Mr. Mackey,"Don't you call us un-American! This country was founded on the right to protest! M'kay?
"
7,5,Cartman,"Jeh-
"
12,9,Cartman,"You're a chick, dude.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Oh, shut up, Kyle!!! Shut your Goddamned Jew mouth!!! You people are why there's war in the Middle East!!!  And you, Tweek!! Why don't you learn to button your shirt right, for once?! You're as bad as Stan with his stupid girlfriend, always spending time with her!! God, I hate you guys!!  They were supposed to take me away to their underwater kingdom. They were supposed to take me on adventures of the deep
"
8,2,Timmy,"No Timmy, Jimmy.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Dude! He's making ice cream. 
"
12,8,Stan,"Kyle, you're supposed to tell Cartman he's being racist or something?
"
3,14,Kyle,"Yeah.
"
1,5,Stan,"Sick dude, she's my sister.
"
6,12,Stan,"We just have to face it. We're not gonna get Kenny back and we're not gonna have our shopping spree. It's over! 
"
14,4,Kenny,"(Sixty two)
"
14,8,Cartman,"Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on.  Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? 
"
8,10,Stan,"No, no, we've just gotta find better help.
"
8,6,Kyle,"Mr. Jefferson, your son can't get up.
"
2,7,Stan,"Give us some, Cartman!
"
18,7,Kyle,"You found Cartman like this and you think he's somehow trapped in virtual reality?
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Hey fellas.
"
9,9,Butters,"Okay. I'm not lookin'. 
"
1,13,Stan,"We're not getting on, you fat ugly bitch!
"
14,6,Kyle,"Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
"
3,17,Stan,"No, uhno, not finkleroy.
"
6,16,Butters,"Wow! Neato!
"
14,2,Kyle,"The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
"
9,2,Kyle,"You said it!
"
13,4,Randy,"It stopped being funny the second that air came out her vagina, Sharon! 
"
1,5,Stan,"So how do we do that?
"
11,3,Butters,"Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair.
"
16,12,Stan,"I'm sorry you guys. My dad is doing a big Halloween promotion.
"
11,7,Kyle,"What's it doing?
"
7,6,Cartman,"Would you like those pants cleaned for four ninety five?
"
9,11,Kyle,"Are you in?
"
2,9,Kyle,"What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?
"
7,11,Butters,"Whoa!
"
16,1,Kyle,"I know, fatass. I was there.
"
8,1,Stan,"Hyeah, ""they're not that cool."" These are real authentic weapons from the Far East.
"
2,10,Stan,"I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million dollars. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean,  I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? 
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles.
"
3,15,Cartman,"...play stupid games.
"
4,10,Cartman,"""It's a man's obligation to stick his boneration in a woman's separation  to increase the population of the younger generation.""
"
6,13,Jimmy,"They took it back to the video s... the video s...
"
9,3,Kyle,"What do you mean? We thought she was with you.
"
8,11,Butters,"So Dagwood says ""Good, guh-good thing we're playin' ...uh the back nine at your house."" 
"
14,9,Randy,"Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!
"
4,1,Butters,"Yeah. Oo-oo-why, us men will show those skanky hos who's who!
"
15,2,Timmy,"Timmy Timmy Timmy! Timmih!
"
1,2,Cartman,"What?
"
1,5,Kyle,"Well, our pig hasn't given birth yet, but she should anytime now.
"
15,14,Kenny,"(What the fuck are you doing here?!)
"
15,7,Stan,"Oh no.
"
2,13,Kyle,"What?!
"
9,3,Stan,"...Oh Jesus Christ. If that big CAA talent agency finds out she has work, they're gonna try to steal her away from us again.
"
1,12,Cartman,"Ugh. Llet me go! Seriously!
"
15,10,Stan,"Stop that rat! 
"
3,6,Cartman,"Uh-huh? That model airplane kit? Go on.
"
4,15,Stan,"Chef, what's a prostitute?
"
8,11,Stan,"Uh, yeah, we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration, so we're gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Token, I wasn't on that jury. Okay?
"
1,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey! Sshhhh! I'll get in trouble.
"
8,2,Stan,"That's really, really terrible, dude.
"
10,6,Kyle,"What the hell is that??
"
9,8,Stan,"Look, maybe, maybe we can help those people in Beaverton ourselves.
"
4,15,Kyle,"Kick ass, dude!
"
3,9,Kenny,"(Ow!) 
"
11,13,Cartman,"All right, Stan, you've got it, man!
"
12,5,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, we think it's best you not teach until you get your personal life in order, m'kay? 
"
6,17,Cartman,"Yeah, but not if you guys have one, too! Now it's worthless and gay! God-damnit I'll never try to be nice again! 
"
3,10,Cartman,"Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon. 
"
7,7,Stan,"She's hanging in there.  Here, drink some beer. 
"
2,18,Cartman,"Fine.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Yeah, now finish 'em off! 
"
1,12,Cartman,"Screw you, triangle thief!
"
9,11,Kyle,"I don't believe it.
"
6,5,Kyle,"Dude, why'd you make that deal? If we're out buying tampons, we'll miss the trailer anyway/
"
6,9,Stan,"Come on, you guys. Let's get out of here. 
"
4,2,Timmy,"Go! Timmy go!  Yeah, Timmy! 
"
6,12,Cartman,"Huh! ... I don't think that chocolate milk mix agreed with my stomach. 
"
18,1,Stan,"Pungent crotch sweat. Pungent milk- milky crotch spooge.
"
14,11,Randy,"I mean, hello!
"
1,12,Cartman,"No! Don't!  AAAAAA! AAAAADUH!
"
18,2,Stan,"Yeah, he said some guy at work is Lorde's uncle or something.
"
11,1,Randy,"Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.
"
4,15,Cartman,"This... is... bullcrap!
"
15,12,Cartman,"Heheheheheh! Look you guys, a Jew on a rope. You know what they call a Jew on a rope?
"
17,9,Randy,"What?! Oh my God, everyone likes Tom Hanks and Beyoncé!  I've gotta save them!
"
10,9,Kyle,"What is it?
"
7,14,Stan,"Kyle, this is my life.  Jimmy!
"
4,1,Cartman,"You guys! 
"
2,12,Kyle,"We should use nails, dude.
"
2,3,Cartman,"Chickenlover!
"
2,14,Kyle,"Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time.
"
13,2,Wendy,"How are you so sure Mysterion is a boy?
"
18,7,Kenny,"(Yeah!)
"
7,1,Kyle,"Totally!
"
2,12,Randy,"I'm already there.  What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more.
"
8,3,Kyle,"I'm not arguing about The Passion! He's being an asshole!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Yeah yeah. Can you tell me what year it is?
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Look, it's very simple. We took a vote and the vote tied, so now we gotta come up with a way--
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Oh! Oh! Oh, Dad! Oh, goodness gracious, uh! Oh, stop Dad, stop! Whahawah, whah, how could you-hoo?!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Token, calm down.
"
17,2,Kyle,"We heard that you might be teaching Minecraft to adults.
"
12,8,Cartman,"There you are, Butters!
"
4,16,Kyle,"But that's not fair! You lied to me!
"
17,9,Kenny,"Minna-san! Kenni kimasu! 
"
15,4,Kyle,"Your wiener is not 13 inches long!
"
1,2,Cartman,"Oh, you know, this and that.
"
16,12,Kyle,"For Odin! For Asgard!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"I put together a comedy show and I was crippled from BIRTH! 
"
4,7,Stan,"This is it??
"
7,4,Cartman,"Everyone, stop! Please! 
"
18,7,Cartman,"That's right!
"
5,11,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus!! 
"
11,1,Randy,"Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle!  Niggers!  Huh?  Ohhh...
"
5,12,Stan,"Yeah, I get it for that.
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie.  Isn't this exciting, two A+ students in a cloning war.
"
13,9,Butters,"What?
"
4,10,Cartman,"How was it?
"
16,11,Butters,"Kenny, be careful!
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"What's goin' on, Kyle??
"
7,13,Kyle,"Guys, I think we should bail out of this right now!
"
18,10,Cartman,"Hahaha, look at kyle, brahs. he's all pissed off. CartmaanBrah!
"
7,4,Cartman,"All I have to do is be thinking about American history when I walk through this doorway. I'll trip the rope, causing the rock to fall on my head. And then I will have a flashback to the times of our Founding Fathers!
"
11,9,Randy,"But then, does it still count?
"
3,11,Kyle,"Yeh-hah. 
"
2,3,Kenny,"(There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)
"
8,9,Butters,"Wull ah I'm just playin' Monster. It's kinda spooky out here. 
"
6,3,Butters,"I'm tired of it. You hear me, fellas?! Kenny's dead and you'll just have tuh deal with it.
"
18,10,Kyle,"I'm NOT a GRANDPA!
"
8,1,Cartman,"No way, you got weapons too?!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Hey. 
"
6,10,Kyle,"Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn't become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?
"
12,8,Stan,"We'll all testify. We can't let them ever do this again.  I love you.
"
15,4,Cartman,"The Jews!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Because he has the God-damned ticket for the-!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Kind of.
"
13,11,Stan,"You said ""Stan, me and Kenny don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales!""
"
1,8,Stan,"We did it!! 
"
3,14,Cartman,"Yippie! Long live the Confederacy!
"
7,1,Cartman,"...Oh, thank God! Well then, thank you Lord.
"
7,11,Kyle,"I'm gonna take Butters. He invited me to his birthday party last month, so I owe him one.
"
9,5,Stan,"Dad? Dad, we need to talk.
"
8,11,Cartman,"All right, nice reporting, guys. Nice. 
"
6,6,Butters,"Okay, Mom.  So. Someone has discovered my horrible secret. This could be a trap set by the FBI. Oh, I'll be at the docks, precious FBI! But it is I who'll have the trap set for you! Come, my minions!  We haven't much time!
"
6,7,Butters,"Aww, I don't wanna do it now , not if they already did it on the Simpsons.  I have to think of something else.  Uh Goddamnit, how come every time I think of something clever, the Simpsons already did it?
"
8,8,Stan,"I thought I was supposed to make my own decision.
"
4,2,Stan,"Tell us what?!
"
6,17,Kyle,"Hey. Aren't you guys the underpants gnomes?
"
18,5,Butters,"Craig's mom doesn't seem very happy.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Be as sick as you want, just give me a God-damned bass line! 
"
15,14,Stan,"Really?
"
2,15,Kenny,"(Ow, mom!)
"
17,9,Cartman,"So what are you saying, Kyle?!
"
8,8,Kyle,"It was my idea and we're gonna tell everyone to write in ""Giant Douche!"" It's way funnier!
"
2,12,Cartman,"How many people?
"
2,8,Cartman,"Eh-eh-eh-eh... 
"
4,17,Kyle,"Oh, yeah.
"
15,1,Butters,"Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
"
11,2,Cartman,"Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!
"
8,5,Butters,"What the heck?  Whoa! What a huge package!  ""To Butters Stotch.""  Oh boy! It's for me! It's for me!  Who is it from? ""Sent from: Japan. Konichi-wa.""  Wow! A package for me from Japan!!  Wow, what can it be? My birthday isn't until September 11.  Oh boy! I've never gotten a package this big! I've always wanted to have a huge package. 
"
9,5,Cartman,"We're gonna lose! We're gonna lose!
"
1,1,Cartman,"God damn it, I didn't have an anal probe!  Screw you guys, I'm goin' home.
"
18,10,Cartman,"Oh weak, bros, so weak!
"
15,4,Butters,"Oh what's the point, Mom?! What's the point of life anyway?! All you do is yell at me! And the government... wuh, which is led by fascists, and everyone's a Justin Bieber wannabe. I wanna go and drive a Hummer, that's what I wanna do! I wanna drive a car that goes, that goes rawr rawr rawrawrawr!
"
12,8,Butters,"What? What happened? 
"
8,7,Randy,"They're only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do.
"
8,9,Stan,"Well, the guy in Arkansas said to destroy the heart. 
"
6,14,Stan,"Kyle.  Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures.
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah! God, you guys are dicks!
"
7,2,Stan,"That's nice, guys. We're just gonna stay out of this one. 
"
4,11,Kyle,"Ow! 
"
13,9,Kyle,"You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! 
"
2,4,Kyle,"And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family.  Except for Cartman.
"
12,3,Cartman,"All right. Come on, Rufus. Quietly.  Oh jeez, no, no, I can't hide you all.  I'm sorry, you'll just have to find somewhere else to-  Well, I suppose I'll get in just as much trouble for four cats as for two. Come on. 
"
2,3,Cartman,"Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Stop listening to my conversation, Kyle! What are you, the NSA?! Lawrence, remember how I was tellin' you the NSA listens to everyone's phone calls and reads all our e-mails?
"
18,3,Randy,"Autotune. Wanna see how I do it?  I come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work. I use this program to import the recordings I make on my phone.  ""Yeah yeah, feeling good on a Wednesday. Sparklinnnnn' thoughts. Givin' me the hope to go ohhhn""  ""Oh! Whoa. What I need now is a little bit of shelter.""
"
2,11,Cartman,"Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!
"
9,14,Stan,"Naw. All or nothing is easy. But learning to drink a little bit, responsibly, that'sa disciprine. Disciprine... come from within. 
"
9,11,Kyle,"Oh Jesus, I should have known!
"
14,4,Stan,"Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up!  Where is profile Stan Marsh! 
"
9,5,Kyle,"We're so proud of you kids!
"
2,8,Cartman,"Uh, screw you guys. Home. 
"
17,2,Randy,"Yeah, okay, I'm headin' there now.
"
18,9,Kyle,"This fat fuck thinks he's PewDiePie! Because of him I can't get Ike to come out of his room!
"
4,15,Stan,"I'll throw in five.
"
1,3,Stan,"Why?
"
11,5,Stan,"He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
"
3,3,Kyle,"Oh, you can pretend all you want! You're not fooling anybody!
"
6,1,Butters,"Wow, Jared!
"
11,4,Cartman,"The Germans?
"
1,13,Mr. Garrison,"So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I'm afraid you're never going to know. 
"
3,8,Randy,"Well I just... I have this buddy, uh, he, sat and watched another guy ...play with himself.
"
9,4,Kyle,"That thing is pretty cool. What games did you get with it?
"
11,1,Randy,"Fine! 
"
17,2,Cartman,"Concerned?! Thanks to you and your stupid app, parents are still watching murder porn, and now they're screwing up Minecraft too! 
"
3,15,Stan,"It fell;
"
11,12,Butters,"Well I just... used my imagination.
"
6,9,Cartman,"Yeah, we're children.
"
16,7,Cartman,"What?
"
4,1,Kyle,"Dude, I didn't know Token lived so far away.
"
9,13,Cartman,"Haha! I'm totally wet! This is awesome!!
"
3,14,Kyle,"No they're not, stupid!
"
5,3,Stan,"I don't care! I'm leaving!  'Scuse me. 
"
16,4,Cartman,"Noooo! 
"
7,14,Butters,"Oh, I see.  You don't approve of my girlfriend!  Well let me tell you somethin', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we're gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can't be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad!  Come on, Lexus. I'm movin' out of my parents' house and I'm movin' in with you. Uh let's blow this joint!
"
16,14,Cartman,"So here's the deal, General Tso, Mr. President, when the Chinese make the sequels, I get to play the part of Luke Skywalker's son. Cartman Skywalker.
"
11,3,Cartman,"Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle!  Huh, I guess you're clean. 
"
14,5,Kyle,"A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?
"
8,6,Cartman,"They're a new family that just moved to South Park! We met this kid named Blanket and he has the coolest dad in the world! 
"
14,4,Stan,"I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat.
"
17,7,Kyle,"Yeah, but, why can't XBox automatically let you pre-order Metal Gear Solid V?
"
18,10,Stan,"Who did?
"
3,12,Cartman,"Cool!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"What do I have? The weapon of comedy. So apparently the Chinese and the Japanese aren't getting along lately. Have you seen this? Have you heard about this?
"
1,10,Kyle,"You bastard!
"
10,2,Cartman,"Turning right at O two four niner. 
"
12,5,Cartman,"Look at the scoreboard, amigo. No matter how many times you say I cheated, the scoreboard says two, nothing. 
"
7,1,Stan,"Yeah, that's like that stupid movie, Contact.
"
12,2,Stan,"All right, enough already! This has all gone on long enough!
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Ugh!)
"
7,3,Butters,"You know, it's not my parents I'm worried about. It's my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.
"
5,9,Stan,"Hey, shut up, kid. America didn't start this war.
"
14,5,Randy,"Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved. 
"
14,2,Stan,"I can't believe they won't ban our book!
"
9,2,Randy,"Eric, you were right. About the hippies. Could you... get rid of them for us now?
"
16,3,Stan,"Public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé.
"
3,8,Randy,"Nothing. Uh. I'm gonna go get some chips.
"
18,3,Butters,"Hey! Everything okay, Stan?
"
1,5,Kyle,"We can use Cartman's pig.
"
9,10,Kyle,"Thanks dude! 
"
2,15,Cartman,"Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
"
2,7,Kyle,"Now, that's what I call a sticky situation. 
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Sorry Eric, but I've gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin'.
"
3,12,Cartman,"That didn't help at all.
"
4,3,Randy,"What? 
"
10,10,Kyle,"Ike?
"
1,12,Kyle,"You threw it away, Cartman!
"
6,15,Stan,"Fine, douche! 
"
7,1,Cartman,"I couldn't resist. I'm sorry. 
"
16,10,Cartman,"Oh fuck.  Oh what's the- God damn it!  Hello?
"
2,10,Stan,"Weak!
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Huah!
"
16,12,Stan,"It's okay Kyle, It's okay. Hit OK.  You guys go win that costume contest. You can do it. Lift the trophy for me.
"
3,3,Cartman,"They look exactly the same.
"
12,11,Cartman,"Hey, it's that asshole who sent us to the jungle with nobody to pick us up!
"
6,6,Kyle,"Jimmy.
"
6,13,Butters,"First, just let Butters sseee the precious.
"
4,12,Stan,"Oh! Here she comes.
"
9,11,Kyle,"I just had a couple more questions about-
"
18,8,Randy,"Oh yehhs yesyseyseyesyseyse Sharon, I don't know why or how, but people all over town are talking about it again. Now you know that I was one of the best back in college.
"
5,12,Stan,"Oh, but we're not gonna rip on you for being rich anymore.
"
11,9,Randy,"Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning.
"
7,7,Stan,"Cure SARS? Aw, Jesus!
"
18,2,Cartman,"Yeah well, I'm glad people aren't mad at you anymore. I know what that feels like.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Mel Gibson was right, Kyle. Right now the Jew in you is screaming ""NO! Those cost money! Get your money back!"" You know this to be true.  Go ahead. Prove Mel Gibson wrong, Kyle.  Do it. 
"
6,13,Butters,"Oh golly.  Hey, what's happening down there? 
"
12,9,Butters,"I don't wanna get killed by boobs.
"
13,6,Randy,"Yeah, somebody better break the news to Norway; they were really close.
"
6,13,Randy,"Yeeaahhh.  Alright, you ready?
"
11,2,Cartman,"How?
"
16,10,Randy,"We scared him! We thought that'd be enough!
"
15,4,Randy,"Did they measure from the base or from the balls? 
"
13,6,Randy,"Nobody can build anything!!
"
10,8,Randy,"No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2.  I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see?  ""Hello.""  In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing. 
"
15,1,Kyle,"(Yes. Yes, hurry up.) 
"
8,13,Cartman,"Oh yeah. Awesome. Hold on, just a second.  Mom, there's some homeless guy here. Make him go away. 
"
6,10,Stan,"Hi. Uh, the school called and said we all have to start going to class again.
"
2,15,Stan,"Just help me take it back. Come on!  Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"A note from the principal? ""Please excuse Timmy from all questions and all homework, as he has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder.""  Oh, brother!
"
9,14,Randy,"Thanks son.
"
1,1,Cartman,"You guys, shut up. I'm not under alien control.
"
3,2,Randy,"Maybe nothing...  maybe everything.
"
16,5,Butters,"Oh hamburgers! 
"
2,14,Kyle,"What the hell are you singing, Cartman?
"
1,13,Mr. Garrison,"Mr. Hat, you need to admit you have a drinking problem!  Another Cosmo, please.
"
7,1,Stan,"Let's go!
"
9,8,Randy,"Stan?  We've found Stan! Ugh. 
"
3,14,Cartman,"No. I say we take Topeka.
"
3,11,Stan,"U-uh, cool. My name is Stan, and a-uh, I'm the leader of Earth.
"
2,3,Kenny,"(Daaarrrggghh--)  (-ooggghhh...)
"
3,12,Stan,"I'm sick of those fifth graders scaring us all the time! We should come up with a way to scare them!
"
16,8,Butters,"Wuh sure, Eric. 
"
3,8,Randy,"Yuh... You didn't ...tell anybody, did you?
"
10,1,Cartman,"Oh never mind.
"
8,6,Stan,"Kyle? 
"
8,4,Stan,"And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.
"
1,12,Stan,"He did it!
"
16,10,Randy,"No, I think I'll uh, ...just hang out a little longer.  I'll get it. 
"
2,7,Stan,"I don't know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.
"
7,6,Cartman,"I see two guys inside. They have Sarah Peterson's doll, you stupid Jew!
"
9,6,Stan,"Dude, he did that to me this morning.
"
8,10,Butters,"Nothins' wrong, sir. Eh, nothin' at all.
"
17,9,Kenny,"Minna-san, sayonara! Ima, Purincessu Kenni tomodachi ni kaerimasu! 
"
12,4,Butters,"Yippie!
"
16,14,Butters,"Red Lobster!
"
13,7,Cartman,"Alright, let's go! 
"
8,4,Stan,"Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.
"
5,4,Kyle,"Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. 
"
16,1,Cartman,"Clyde, you there? Hello? 
"
9,3,Stan,"You bastards!
"
1,2,Cartman,"Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds.
"
4,12,Stan,"Dude, it looks like he's been all over time! He must have such cool stuff to tell us.
"
10,14,Randy,"Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again.  Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go.  I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying ""That's my son!""  And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose. 
"
6,16,Cartman,"Okay, well let's do that then. That looks nice.
"
3,12,Kyle,"Yeah, fatass, a dead body.
"
14,4,Stan,"Yahtzee. Sixes.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Come on, Marvin! We've gotta get your people to Marklar before the missionaries do!
"
9,6,Butters,"Well, I guess saying goodbye wasn't enough.
"
13,11,Kenny,"(Yeah, can we go?)
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Nut Gobbler, grab onto my crutch! 
"
13,4,Cartman,"Oh man, I thought that day would never end.
"
4,4,Timmy,"Timmiihh!
"
14,14,Randy,"Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm.
"
1,13,Cartman,"Huh??
"
3,11,Cartman,"Start with Kenny! Start with Kenny! 
"
2,6,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
11,7,Stan,"Well dude, what are we supposed to do?
"
3,16,Stan,"Bad.
"
13,13,Wendy,"What was I supposed to do? The school was running out of power. We tried relocating the Smurfs at first, but they wouldn't budge! So we decided to get somebody on the inside. A member of the school who could act like one of the Smurfs and learn their secrets. But of course you know that, don't you?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Pussy! Cock! Shit! 
"
10,2,Butters,"At Cartman's house.
"
12,2,Kyle,"We uh, we have special permission?
"
10,1,Kyle,"We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days.  Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us.  But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile.  I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song.  I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by.  So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains.
"
18,9,Cartman,"There is a crisis in America. and we have to save our living rooms. Our living rooms are dying.
"
9,4,Kenny,"(All right. How am I supposed to do that?)
"
2,12,Kyle,"But I don't care.
"
1,1,Wendy,"Hey, he's like Rudolph.
"
11,2,Butters,"He's bi-curious too?
"
2,17,Stan,"Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--
"
1,13,Cartman,"So who put his who-who-dilly in your cha-cha?
"
6,2,Randy,"Listen uh, it's been thirty minutes. We'd like to go hit the slopes now?
"
6,16,Butters,"Wow, Eh eh you sure are a p-professional, Eric! I don't know which swatch I like best.
"
3,1,Cartman,"Well, why the hell don't they get jobs?!  Ey! Why don't you people quit slacking off, and get a job! What's wrong with you?! Go to college!
"
11,7,Stan,"Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!
"
7,7,Cartman,"Man, Indians have it good, huh?
"
1,6,Cartman,"Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang.
"
15,8,Mr. Mackey,"Huh... e-excuse me a minute, Stan. m'kay?  Uh, hi, Ms. Bronski? Did we vaccinate Stan for the flu last year? We did? Uh oh... I think he's got Asperger's.
"
9,6,Kenny,"(Fuck yeah!)
"
3,6,Kyle,"Wait! 
"
11,5,Stan,"Jesus Christ! 
"
16,9,Kyle,"Just, you know, make some money off him. Like Honey Boo boo.
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"Oh dear.  Here Stanley, sit down, have some cocoa, and tell your friend Mr. Hat all about it. 
"
1,8,Kenny,"(Dude, it's a pipe for your peepee)
"
11,8,Cartman,"No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.
"
13,6,Randy,"Well I mean...  this is a lot of space cash, guys. Think o'what we could do with it.
"
13,12,Stan,"I don't know.
"
16,3,Kenny,"(Yeah, dude!)
"
2,17,Stan,"Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"I don't know. It doesn't feel wrong.  I've been thinking about you a lot, Ms. Choksondik.
"
5,7,Stan,"""Scream for me, bitch!""
"
18,3,Stan,"What is that?
"
2,12,Stan,"Yeah.
"
13,10,Cartman,"This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!
"
12,1,Kyle,"What did you do?!
"
1,8,Kyle,"What's your name dude?
"
3,11,Stan,"Run for it!
"
1,1,Wendy,"Well, if the fat kid has something implanted in his ass, maybe the visitors are using him as part of their plan. Maybe you should use the fat kid as bait to bring them back.
"
18,9,Kyle,"Please Dad, I've been looking forward to this all week. Aaand it's me and Ike's bonding time. Really. This is good for our relationship.
"
18,2,Kyle,"Sup, Jason? 
"
8,8,Randy,"Stanley, when you left for school this morning, you said you were going to vote!
"
2,8,Kyle,"Hey, look! It's snowing! 
"
9,6,Cartman,"We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I'm gonna miss you.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"What?? That's what I'm doing!
"
11,12,Kyle,"Oh boy...
"
2,13,Stan,"What?!
"
12,10,Stan,"God!
"
6,13,Butters,"The precious?  Could you bring back my precious?
"
15,2,Cartman,"Ugh, let me talk to them. 
"
4,10,Kyle,"Uhwuwhat?
"
12,7,Cartman,"Sweet, there's still cops looking for us in here. All right, follow my lead, Butters.  Hohoo man, hasn't this place been fascinating, Butters?
"
17,2,Randy,"OH! Ohoho, you bitch!  Ohohunh.
"
12,7,Butters,"You said they wouldn't notice we were gone. You promised. 
"
1,1,Cartman,"No, Kitty, you bad kitt--!
"
10,12,Butters,"...Die??
"
7,14,Cartman,"God, what a fag!
"
9,2,Stan,"Well... Well what do we do?
"
18,5,Butters,"Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that's the last time I felt happy.
"
11,8,Cartman,"Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!
"
3,9,Kyle,"Oh. Ike, Squirts is so much fun--
"
11,10,Cartman,"It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now.  Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?
"
3,1,Stan,"AAAAAAA! 
"
4,10,Butters,"Uh us too. Uh we saw a picture of a naked lady. We could see her whole beaver.
"
6,4,Kyle,"What?!
"
1,11,Wendy,"It smells like a dead calf rotting in the hot sun!
"
18,9,Cartman,"That's what they're called, dude. Get with the times. 
"
10,9,Stan,"Kyle!
"
18,7,Cartman,"Are you fucking with me?!
"
17,10,Wendy,"Do you see what I'm talking about?
"
11,8,Cartman,"Uhh nuh-nothing...
"
9,13,Kyle,"Sick?
"
8,1,Kyle,"I still say this is a bad idea.
"
1,7,Stan,"Wendy, I know we had a fight, and I did wish you were dead, but, I didn't mean it.
"
9,1,Kyle,"How can I not be nervous? Trying out for the All-State team has been my dream for years.
"
5,1,Mr. Garrison,"Oh boy, this show is really reaching for plot now!
"
7,8,Kenny,"(I just LOVE this jacket 'cause it's SOOO beautiful!)
"
18,3,Stan,"Dad, Lorde's music is actually really good.
"
6,1,Randy,"Here he comes! 
"
7,12,Stan,"Dude, stop it.
"
16,14,Cartman,"Really? Well then, I suppose that making the votes public IS the right thing to do. I can get the ballots for you. But if I'm gonna smuggle them here, I'm gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun.
"
3,10,Cartman,"Yes.
"
6,11,Randy,"What's the matter? 
"
6,8,Kyle,"Well, go on, smartass, and do it!
"
13,13,Butters,"Oh you bet! I love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything, and how she's changing everything?
"
7,10,Stan,"I'm not staying the winter in this room! We just need to tell old people they can't drive anymore!
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"What do you mean he's not here?
"
3,16,Stan,"Nn-nobody! I mean, uh, well, m-my dad.
"
15,2,Butters,"Is it true? Do Germans wanna kill us?
"
13,1,Stan,"Dude, who the hell did that?  Hwa? 
"
10,1,Kyle,"Going away? For how long?
"
13,6,Randy,"We're working on it! 
"
10,1,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
7,1,Cartman,"Dude. You know that feeling when you take a huuuge dump? Awesome! 
"
5,9,Stan,"Yu- you're gonna have to take it home with you, Kyle.
"
3,6,Cartman,"Lumpy potatoes?! Oh, no!
"
1,10,Kyle,"They were all out of 'em dude!
"
10,10,Kyle,"What's he doing at his teacher's house?
"
5,2,Randy,"Well, you boys must be pretty excited: Your first night of Scouts.
"
3,16,Stan,"Hey, Chef.
"
4,11,Stan,"Don't you guys, um... persecrute our religious beliefs.
"
1,5,Stan,"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?!
"
15,8,Stan,"Dude, I canh- I... I can't do any...
"
13,10,Stan,"Vince McMahon is coming to see us?
"
6,2,Randy,"Oh, do we have to do it right now?
"
16,6,Stan,"So, I just tried to keep the tour group moving, as fast as possible.
"
8,6,Stan,"What?
"
3,1,Kyle,"God-damn, it's hot out here!
"
13,13,Stan,"Hey hey, stop reading that!
"
8,5,Butters,"That's great AWESOM-O!  You can carry all my laundry in one trip!
"
13,5,Kyle,"We know, Cartman!
"
16,8,Randy,"BOHHHHH! Did you see that hit? BOOOOM!
"
2,15,Cartman,"Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!
"
7,1,Stan,"Chef!! 
"
5,3,Stan,"Kyle, please. You-  You're my best friend.
"
10,14,Stan,"Oh
"
16,1,Randy,"I'm not gonna fall in. I'm not a chick. 
"
11,9,Randy,"Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece.
"
13,14,Cartman,"What has happened to this place?
I don’t recognize it anymore.
It used to be so fun and special.
What is life worth living for?
The dream is dead, our land is gone;
There’s a hole in my heart and I can’t go on.
There are too many minorities (minorities)
At my water park (my water park).
This was our land, our dream (our dream),
and they’ve taken it all away.
They just keep coming and coming (minorities).
I tried to go and tell the police,
But even the authorities
Are minorities
At my water park.
There’s no place for me to sit anymore,
And the lines just keep getting crazier.
There are Mexicans all around me.
The lazy river has never been lazier.
It’s a 40 minute wait to go down one slide,
And the instructions are in Spanish on the Zip Line ride!
"
7,13,Kenny,"(Well yep, that's what I think.)
"
7,12,Kyle,"Dude, that new kid is such a douche!
"
3,13,Kyle,"Aaaah!
"
14,5,Cartman,"My father...
"
1,5,Kyle,"To the Genetical Engineering Ranch.
"
17,10,Wendy,"Because people should be okay with the way they look! I have pimples on my forehead! My bottom teeth are crooked! So what?! You have short legs.
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay, that sounded great, kids. 
"
11,10,Cartman,"It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!
"
18,7,Stan,"Butters, what the hell are you doing?
"
8,9,Randy,"Wait. I think I understand the symbolism of the mirror. The Wall-Mart... is us.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Black people say He-ey!  Cool. White people say Ho ho! 
"
4,17,Kyle,"Heee might not come if you're too close to the toilet bowl, Ike.  Come sit by me. 
"
11,3,Stan,"What do you think happens if you do have it?
"
4,14,Stan,"'Cause the 'eard 'urts my 'ace.
"
2,7,Stan,"Where are we?
"
1,1,Cartman,"Eh, no, that, that was just a dream. And I'm not fat, I'm big boned!
"
1,10,Mr. Garrison,"Now, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate...  uh-uh, what's your name again?
"
18,1,Cartman,"Well, somebody did!
"
11,8,Cartman,"Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! 
"
15,4,Randy,"Good! The man puts his penis  Okay? Into the woman's vagina.  Okay now, sometimes, a man can feel like how long his penis is, is actually important. But is it? When you boys measure your penis length, the truth is it doesn't really matter. What does matter is  Length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared, okay? When we're talking about penis size, we can't just use a tape measure. We need a scale  and...  a protractor as well.  Let's look at it on the graph here..  Follow along with me on your study sheets, kids.
"
2,13,Kyle,"Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!
"
9,5,Cartman,"Ball. Balll. 
"
2,10,Cartman,"Pfff..!
"
12,1,Cartman,"See? He's tattling again. He hasn't learned a thing you guys. 
"
11,12,Kyle,"Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!
"
10,1,Cartman,"...Huh?
"
4,2,Kenny,"(No way!)
"
16,4,Cartman,"I've already done my research boys. What you're looking at there is a Jewpacabra.
"
4,3,Stan,"Oh, well. Doing our own circus was a dumb idea anyways.
"
4,10,Cartman,"And that was about everything from first grade. Then last year, well, you can't tell anybody about this stuff, right?
"
17,9,Cartman,"Oh uum, Tom Hanks aaand Beyoncé.
"
2,10,Stan,"Okay.
"
8,7,Cartman,"Ooo, ouch, ma'am, please, let go of that tight grip you have on my balls! Ten dollars, you're breaking my balls, ma'am!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Der yourself, hippie!
"
18,5,Cartman,"You were what?!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Nuh uh.
"
8,1,Kyle,"God dammit, Cartman! You can't keep making up new powers!
"
4,10,Kyle,"No-o-o-o-o!
"
3,2,Stan,"Dad. Dad! 
"
2,13,Kyle,"I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Yeah, like the kid with the wallet.
"
16,11,Kenny,"(You do?)
"
12,2,Kyle,"Ahall right!
"
5,12,Kyle,"And Stan for being in love with Wendy.
"
1,4,Cartman,"Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an ""A-""?
"
1,5,Cartman,"Yes ma'am.
"
7,11,Kyle,"Do you really think that beating up a handicapped kid is being nice? 
"
11,2,Kyle,"Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on.
"
18,3,Cartman,"Wendyl?! Fucking Wendyl?! Grow up, Wendy!
"
8,9,Stan,"What? D-dad, are are you dying?
"
14,6,Kenny,"(I am. He's right here.) 
"
18,9,Kyle,"Nono Dad, please. I just got Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Me and Ike are going to play it together.
"
2,18,Cartman,"Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here.
"
7,13,Stan,"Mom...  Dad, it was just a-
"
14,4,Cartman,"Stupid Facebok stuff.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Too eager to what?
"
16,7,Cartman,"No, they won't!
"
16,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, what are we supposed to do? I mean if Bane is out there on the loose then none of us are safe. One Bane's bad enough, but apparently we got like, like seven Banes? Uhkay?
"
2,9,Kyle,"It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well what are you, Eric? A gay fish?
"
14,5,Stan,"Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!
"
4,6,Kenny,"(Thanks.) 
"
3,2,Stan,"Cartman!
"
6,12,Cartman,"Wha-uh, what?? What?
"
7,2,Stan,"Yeah dude, not cool.
"
13,12,Stan,"Yeah yeah, that's totally what a fag does.
"
4,15,Stan,"I know! 
"
11,7,Randy,"If we have to! Siddown Glen!
"
15,6,Butters,"Me, Butters.
"
6,6,Cartman,"I'm afraid we're gonna have to let you go, as our friend. You're just tooo...
"
16,11,Kyle,"Dude, what the hell? Somebody's gotta stop him.
"
16,12,Stan,"Yeah, people are gonna get hurt.
"
2,6,Cartman,"Ey, get off of him, you fuckin' nutsack!
"
9,6,Butters,"He wishes he would have been a better son sometimes.
"
18,9,Kyle,"It's Cartman's stupid online persona!
"
6,14,Stan,"Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.
"
2,7,Cartman,"You guys can't scare me!
"
14,9,Kyle,"Where the hell are they coming from?! 
"
10,12,Butters,"I got it.  Big Tree. Oval Rock.
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.
"
9,5,Stan,"Hundred bucks, no big whoop.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Yeah?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Jesus Christ!  Holy G...guacamole!  Freakin' Frijoles!  Leapin' L-langosta. 
"
10,10,Cartman,"I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!
"
16,1,Cartman,"His mom... His mom goes: ""Clyde you're an asshole and now I have toilet water in my vagayjay.""
"
1,2,Stan,"We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
"
13,9,Butters,"REALLY great work, bitch! That is another...  sunshine sticker for you.
"
11,10,Cartman,"Uhh, Kyle, I believe a certain someone is supposed to put a certain set of balls in their mouth.
"
4,9,Cartman,"Cucumber in the pants. Got it. 
"
4,9,Randy,"No!!  NOOO!! 
"
1,3,Stan,"Does it have Patrick Duffy for a leg
"
4,17,Stan,"You're supposed to sing Chanukah songs!
"
6,16,Cartman,"Poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now, Stan, and... have you seen the poop swatches.
"
14,4,Stan,"Sure dude.  Dude, what's the matter?
"
4,14,Stan,"No, it's on the 'en or the 'ay. 
"
7,12,Randy,"We're not watching TV! We're Mormons now and we're having Family Home Evening!
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Oh, hey Eric. I was just trying to write some new jokes for my comedy  ...rou-routine.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Let's see. Oh, and I broke Mr. Anderson's fence and never told him about it.
"
16,7,Kyle,"So then, she's gonna be seeing other people? Is she, sort of, available?
"
13,10,Butters,"Now hold on! I am stopping the fight!  Eoh!
"
9,4,Stan,"Oooo.
"
16,3,Cartman,"Dude, what's going on?
"
1,8,Kyle,"The digital sports watch is here.
"
6,4,Randy,"We gave those kids everything, and they turned into little... John Walkers!
"
18,2,Stan,"Morning!
"
1,2,Wendy,"Wow, I knew I would win.
"
10,8,Cartman,"All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow.
"
15,13,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
8,1,Kyle,"Oh man! We are in serious trouble!
"
5,8,Kyle,"The base where you're from and where our Okama GameSphere is! 
"
5,10,Cartman,"Okay, hokay, I'm sorry Ms. Chokesonrocks!
"
8,1,Stan,"Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!  Wait.  Hold on a second. Where's Butters? 
"
5,3,Cartman,"Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize.
"
14,10,Wendy,"Okay.  I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan.
"
12,11,Randy,"We've got to get out of town. Go through that way. 
"
3,3,Stan,"Where's Chef?
"
3,9,Kenny,"(What the fuck is that?!)
"
8,8,Stan,"...Okay. I'll vote.
"
3,1,Kyle,"Dude! Bulldozers rule!
"
4,12,Cartman,"Why, that's PERfect!
"
14,1,Kyle,"Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet.
"
1,6,Stan,"No, I mean, kill my grampa.
"
2,15,Kyle,"We have problems!
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Say, would you guys like to join our club? Oh, I'm sorry. You can't. You aren't crippled. 
"
3,3,Stan,"That's it! We gotta learn that song backwards.
"
1,1,Stan,"Oh, hey Cartman.
"
13,14,Kyle,"Dude!
"
3,16,Cartman,"Yes! I really did.
"
6,12,Stan,"Uh, look. We just really miss our friend and, ah, andand we need to see his remains for closure.
"
1,9,Kyle,"What's going on, you guys?
"
9,10,Stan,"I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Kyle. I'm obviously just a crappy best friend to have.
"
2,3,Kyle,"Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.
"
4,9,Stan,"Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?
"
2,6,Kyle,"Yeah, dude, your Uncle Jimbo sucks ass!
"
12,13,Stan,"Okay, good.
"
9,14,Cartman,"Man, that was such a bummer.
"
13,13,Cartman,"I'm doin' the best I can! 
"
6,7,Stan,"Okay, now let's put the sea ciety in its new home. 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Wiffle ball, anyone?  Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?
"
12,11,Randy,"I've got the video camera. Got it turned on again.  Okay. This is... Randy Marsh... I'm shooting this video of myself. Twenty minutes ago some... huge creatures attacked our town... Still chaos out the window...  I barely made it back to the house. Sharon is here with me,  and there's Shelly.  Wave to the camera, Shelly.
"
14,9,Randy,"Stop playing stupid!
"
13,6,Randy,"Well Stan, we're proud of you for coming clean. But it doesn't change the fact that you cheated. Go to your room, son.
"
9,1,Stan,"Kyle, NO! 
"
6,17,Cartman,"Look at me, I'm riding high in Santa's sleigh. It's Christmas special time for me-
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"No, see, it's a $10,000 upgrade, but it should clean up all of Pat's mistakes.
"
13,8,Cartman,"Because, dude, that's what I'm saying. You have the Chipotlaway so it doesn't matter.
"
5,3,Kyle,"I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- 
"
6,7,Mr. Garrison,"Butters, have you seen Mr. Hat?
"
17,7,Cartman,"Thank you all for coming. Prince Token, Sir Timmy of Blacklake, Lady McCormick . Warriors, we have fought many great battles together. At Clyde's house. At Scott Malkinson's house. But soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives. Winter is coming, and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves.
"
6,7,Kyle,"Huh.
"
17,6,Kyle,"I'm actually the complete opposite.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"The national news? Oh my gosh! People do care! 
"
2,15,Kyle,"It's the evil pets 
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Oh wow, this is incredible! 
"
10,2,Kyle,"Dad, let's just go!
"
12,13,Stan,"Dude, you should do that! You should join the basketball team, right now!
"
13,14,Randy,"Wait here a minute, Stan, I'm gonna call your mother. 
"
14,4,Kyle,"I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now.
"
4,17,Kyle,"All that work!
"
8,7,Stan,"Cartman, just keep your mouth shut.
"
6,5,Stan,"Oh, God, it's horrible! 
"
3,2,Stan,"Wow, he died.
"
2,16,Kyle,"Please stop!
"
3,15,Kenny,"(What?!)
"
6,4,Kyle,"Yeah! And fried chicken! 
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell are you boys doing? You're supposed to be in there.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Stay away from us, Trent!
"
6,3,Butters,"Hang on now.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmih!
"
3,8,Randy,"There's nothing to talk about.
"
10,6,Kyle,"Hello?
"
6,8,Cartman,"It makes perfect sense. Okay, w-work with me on this: if you eat food, you crap out your butt, right?
"
14,5,Randy,"Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you.
"
6,6,Stan,"All right, congratulations to those of you selected to stay. In the end, one of you will be the new Kenny.  Good luck.
"
16,13,Kyle,"S-so you did superglue it.
"
2,9,Kyle,"You guys, we have to hurry!
"
1,7,Stan,"Wait, where are we going?
"
3,14,Kyle,"You're on!
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"The machine is aaaah? Uh that's probably bad.
"
15,4,Randy,"Well first of all, we want that surgeon general to step down!
"
18,2,Randy,"Heavy cream, sugar, chocolate syrup - no, ice cream's good for you!
"
7,10,Cartman,"Is it? Two years ago they closed the Country Kitchen Buffet in Steamboat Springs. And all the old people died of starvation in less than a week.
"
14,9,Kyle,"Aaaarrghhhhhh!  I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! 
"
3,11,Stan,"Now's our chance!
"
9,3,Stan,"Ah our client has an audition to this show.
"
6,16,Stan,"God-damnit, I knew this was too good to be true! Come on, Butters, let's go. 
"
12,13,Stan,"Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not!
"
10,1,Cartman,"So what can we do??
"
14,2,Cartman,"Oho man, I can't wait!
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Well students, why don't we uh-  Oooh. Oh, gee, uh...
"
9,10,Stan,"No problems at all!
"
11,7,Cartman,"No! Fuck off! 
"
15,5,Cartman,"I just can't believe Slash isn't real,
"
7,12,Cartman,"They're just standing there, talking. 
"
9,6,Cartman,"You told me I was a ghost!
"
4,16,Kyle,"Here's our cell phone, dude.  Will you call the police for us? 
"
16,11,Cartman,"Yeah, Mr. Perfect, go rescue Butters so he can lick your balls some more. 
"
3,11,Cartman,"Ey! I'm the leader of Earth!
"
3,3,Stan,"I guess.
"
9,12,Randy,"Oh boy.  Mr. Cruise, you can't just stay in the closet, alright? You need to come out.
"
3,17,Stan,"It is?
"
11,4,Cartman,"I can do this aaall day.
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Sure you can.) 
"
3,5,Stan,"Sick, dude!
"
7,8,Randy,"Boys! Boys! Come on! There's a sale down in Express for Men!  Hey guys! There's a sale in Express for Men! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Well, everybody likes you, Jimmy, a-and you seem to be really good with people, so, I was wondering if you could tell me, how ""do"" you act nice to people?
"
6,17,Stan,"Well, all in all, I have to say this was a pretty special Christmas. 
"
8,5,Cartman,"Waaaaa! 
"
4,7,Stan,"Now, that's a get-well card! 
"
11,2,Butters,"What's... bi-curious?
"
14,9,Cartman,"So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, ""I'll smash your teeth in!"" My head is all like gashed open.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah. That looks pretty good.
"
2,12,Stan,"Dude!
"
9,3,Stan,"Anyone? Help four boys and a Chinese woman get back to Colorado?
"
11,10,Butters,"This is faggot. Go ahead.
"
16,9,Cartman,"Making money off of people's handicaps! Well Token, I would like you to meet my lawyer!  As soon as he gets in here he will be handing you a cease and desist order! That show is not going to air!
"
5,6,Cartman,"GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!! 
"
8,7,Randy,"What?
"
7,11,Cartman,"The meteor... struck the Earth sooner than I predicted. There was no time... no time...
"
12,10,Stan,"Come on, guys. 
"
4,3,Stan,"Where?  Oh, no.  Ha ha, very funny, thank you, goodbye.  No, thank you.  Go away, please.
"
8,1,Kyle,"Whoa.
"
6,16,Butters,"Uh, and after my parents get angry, uh how do we get the poop off the walls?
"
15,12,Cartman,"Polly... Polly Prissypants... You did this?
"
4,1,Butters,"Huh-okay. Uh-ready, uhset,-
"
17,8,Kyle,"What?
"
6,10,Stan,"Uh huh.
"
11,13,Cartman,"Butters, you wanna play me next? 
"
2,2,Kenny,"(This is Team B.)
"
14,6,Stan,"Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad.
"
6,5,Butters,"Uh but the next commercials will be on soon.
"
6,12,Kenny,"(I said, Shut up, Cartman, you blood-belching vagina!)
"
16,7,Kyle,"So, you guys are totally broken up then? It's... done?
"
7,10,Stan,"The American Association of Retired Persons.
"
13,9,Butters,"Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie?  Ohwoah,  whoopie! 
"
6,16,Butters,"Hey look, somebody lost their pet.
"
5,14,Butters,"Happy Anniversary!
"
13,4,Stan,"Mom, we didn't mean... 
"
1,1,Stan,"Dude, that kicks ass!
"
2,7,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
11,3,Cartman,"All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! 
"
2,8,Stan,"What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?
"
9,3,Cartman,"You wanna know what it is, guys?
"
5,13,Stan,"A boat?
"
5,3,Kyle,"Cartman! We've been brainwashed, don't you see? We don't have to do this!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(AAAAAAAAAAAAAA...) 
"
4,3,Kyle,"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! They're identical!
"
9,3,Kyle,"Eminem, Justin Timberlake, Hootie... They all have agents. You need somebody to manage it all for you.
"
9,7,Jimmy,"Uh no, that-that's okay, Mr. Mackey.
"
11,10,Kyle,"STAN, WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE! 
"
6,1,Cartman,"Oh stop your bitchin' Butters! Kenny woulda took it like a man!
"
5,7,Kyle,"Oh, jeez, we're gonna have to buy tons of these things.
"
4,17,Stan,"We don't know anything about animation.
"
18,6,Kyle,"Hey Jimmy. What's up?
"
11,7,Cartman,"Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!
"
16,6,Kyle,"Oh no, don't try to pin this on me! You're the one who brought it up!
"
11,6,Cartman,"Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia.
"
17,9,Cartman,"I think it's best that when the time comes for the mall to open, we should stay back a bit from the doors. 
"
5,10,Kyle,"What, Cartman?
"
5,5,Stan,"It sure did.
"
2,11,Stan,"Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see.
"
9,13,Kyle,"Hang on, Willzy-x. We'll in Mexico soon!.
"
13,12,Kyle,"We're sorry, Mayor.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Alright, everyone scatter and look for the seamen. Tweek, stay by the door and keep a look out. If you see anybody coming, say the code word: Hammertime.
"
2,12,Randy,"I don't interrupt you.
"
8,10,Butters,"Well, no, Trent, I-I'm not like a time-traveler or nothin'.
"
4,15,Stan,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of.
"
16,13,Stan,"NO! Pff! No, that's no, okay? No. And anyway, it's not even the issue.
"
4,10,Stan,"Confession? 
"
16,3,Cartman,"Yeah, yeah, we got it down, you guys. Think we're ready for the big time.
"
9,6,Cartman,"Really?
"
3,6,Stan,"...Thanks a lot, dude.
"
6,7,Cartman,"And I've got the sea men. 
"
5,6,Kyle,"Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn't a God.
"
1,7,Stan,"I'm Raggedy Andy.
"
3,9,Kyle,"Hey! Maybe you can come with me. Then it won't suck so hard.
"
14,4,Stan,"What do you want from me, dude?!
"
7,3,Kyle,"Why are they doing us one at a time?
"
12,12,Randy,"Cehhh-lebrate good Obama come on!  It's Obamobama! 
"
6,13,Stan,"The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. 
"
6,10,Stan,"Uh, we're gonna throw rocks at cars later on, and we thought maybe you'd like to join us.
"
15,4,Cartman,"Are you saying I have problems like these fucking people?!
"
1,9,Kyle,"It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas
My friends won't let me join in any games
And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree
or leave water out for Rudolph 'cause there's something wrong with me
My people don't believe in Jesus Christ's divinity
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
On Christmas
Channukah is nice, but why is it
That Santa passes over my house every year?
And instead of eating ham I have to eat kosher latke
Instead of Silent Night I'm singing huhash dogavish
And what the fuck is up with lighting all these fucking candles, tell me please?
I'm a Jew
A lonely Jew
I'd be merry
But I'm Hebrew
On Christ-maas
"
2,16,Stan,"Okay, let's go!
"
2,12,Cartman,"We'll see about that.  Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny.
"
8,10,Stan,"Dude, what happened?
"
5,3,Cartman,"Alright, Brother Kyle, it is time for us to die! 
"
2,7,Kyle,"Hey yeah, I remember that.
"
1,12,Kyle,"Well, I was just digging around, and I was all like, 'dude, I found this triangle' and my friends were like, 'dude' and I was all like 'dude.'
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Alright Eric, well, well get back to class. We don't want anyone seeing you in here with us.
"
13,14,Jimmy,"To be perfectly frank, I peed in the pool about tututwenty five seconds ago.
"
3,17,Kyle,"Dude, if 4 million people play the brown noise at the same time-
"
9,8,Randy,"Feeling warmth is a symptom of the last stages of hypothermia!
"
6,10,Cartman,"So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?
"
6,17,Kyle,"All I'm saying is that it's gonna take a lot of singing to make up for that!
"
13,13,Cartman,"What? What do you mean I know that?
"
13,8,Cartman,"Yes, Kyle, it's totally normal!  People do this stuff! You know, not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole! 
"
9,13,Butters,"Well okay! Let's do it!
"
15,5,Stan,"Go long, Token! Go go! 
"
3,14,Kyle,"How much do you wanna bet?!
"
2,12,Kyle,"We do?
"
16,3,Stan,"Standing by in three seconds.
"
5,7,Kyle,"That's awesome!
"
12,9,Cartman,"I ain't frontin' dawg! Let's do this! Let's do it right now, yo.
"
4,8,Stan,"You don't even know what you're debating about half the time!
"
1,13,Stan,"In the backyard?
"
6,1,Stan,"Come on, Butters. Time to go.
"
6,12,Randy,"No! Agh, look, I, I think maybe this has gone on far enough.
"
16,8,Randy,"That's IT! 
"
4,6,Stan,"Yeah. Now what are you going to do?
"
17,8,Cartman,"You're outnumbered ten to one, and there's no time left! How will you win?! 
"
11,1,Cartman,"Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha...
"
7,1,Cartman,"What?
"
4,1,Stan,"How are we supposed to give them to you?
"
16,10,Cartman,"Who is there?
"
3,17,Cartman,"""An oscillation of sound that causes the bowels to loosen."" See? That means crap your pants. ""The brown noise is believed to be 92 cents below the lowest octave of Eb."" What does that mean?
"
16,12,Randy,"Hellooo family!  Who wants champagne? 
"
17,10,Wendy,"So you want a Photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections, is that it?! How DARE you, Stan?!
"
15,5,Kyle,"Alright, what is it?!
"
6,4,Stan,"That asshole is gonna kill them and feed them to people!
"
6,4,Stan,"Our parents would never let us starve. They're bluffing. This is a battle of wills. If we hold out long enough, they'll give in.
"
2,9,Kyle,"If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
"
10,11,Stan,"Go ahead, Kyle, do it.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Where the hell is everybody? 
"
2,15,Kyle,"Where have you been, dude?
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Mmmmm'kaaay. I don't quite follow, Timmy.
"
12,2,Butters,"I ain't doin' it! We tricked her and it wasn't nice!
"
6,9,Stan,"Aaaah, , okay apparently there's been a bit of a misunderstanding. This is a rally to save films from their directors? 
"
6,3,Butters,"Uh what condition?
"
13,13,Wendy,"Look, Eric, you have to understand. The Smurfberries were our school government's only option.
"
9,7,Butters,"Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!
"
16,12,Stan,"Hey, where did you guys go?
"
16,5,Butters,"Could I maybe talk to Grammy alone?
"
17,1,Cartman,"Who is that? Is that Toby
"
13,1,Stan,"Come on, Kenny, this isn't you. We want you back, dude.
"
1,7,Stan,"Let's get out of here! 
"
4,16,Kyle,"But all the guys are going!
"
7,8,Randy,"Well, we don't ""pound butt,"" Mr. Garrison, we're straight.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Du-hude! Your dad's a retard! 
"
14,14,Stan,"Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
"
6,3,Cartman,"Ehyeah, sure. Ah I do crack and pot pourri, and queazies
"
2,16,Stan,"He's the fat one.
"
11,12,Butters,"Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key.
"
17,6,Cartman,"I've gotta tell you something, Kyle. The red-headed cow... isn't real. I made him up.
"
6,6,Cartman,"Oh, really?  That's gonna cost some points. 
"
4,7,Stan,"Dude, please. Kyle needs it.
"
8,13,Cartman,"Yes yes, I see! 
"
1,13,Cartman,"My name isn't Eric Cartman, it's Eric Running Water. Now, can I borrow your bike, or do I have to kick you in the nuts and steal it?
"
4,9,Randy,"Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie. 
"
1,11,Kyle,"We don't have respect for Mr. Garrison.
"
5,3,Stan,"To where?
"
4,13,Kyle,"I'm gonna!
"
6,9,Cartman,"Tweek!  TWEEK!!  TWEEK!!
"
2,3,Cartman,"And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?
"
8,4,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
1,9,Stan,"Wh-what could it be? 
"
17,7,Kenny,"(Yes. What's up, my lord?)
"
2,13,Stan,"What's that?
"
17,6,Kyle,"The red- Oh come on, you can't possibly be here for that!
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"Uh, young man, ""Getting Gay With Kids"" is not dumb, m'kay? It just so happens that I'm on the board of directors.
"
11,14,Stan,"The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?
"
8,12,Cartman,"Oh, hey, What's goin' on? I'm uh, here for the party.
"
16,14,Kyle,"This isn't a joke, Cartman! You have to believe me, officer. The outcome of the election depends on it.
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"Well, I'm trying to direct the school Christmas play, but your son was holding the baby Jesus fetus by the head 
"
6,2,Randy,"Oh, God-damnit!
"
9,13,Kyle,"Damnit!  Tell me what to do, Willzy-x! How do we get you home??
"
12,2,Stan,"It's okay, you'll be in the North Pole soon. 
"
13,5,Kyle,"I knew it! Don't let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!
"
4,2,Kenny,"(Why the fuck does it have to be my tooth?)
"
10,4,Cartman,"Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in.
"
8,8,Kyle,"Dude, I'm not going to lose to Cartman's stupid turd sandwich. 
"
16,11,Butters,"Leave me alone!
"
8,9,Randy,"You get a discount working here. Ten percent. That means the bargains are even better.
"
1,9,Stan,"This sucks, dude.  This is like the worst Christmas I have ever seen.
"
9,6,Stan,"I think I have extra.
"
12,4,Butters,"Huh, it somehow loses its punch after multiple viewings.
"
4,12,Timmy,"Timmay! 
"
7,3,Cartman,"Yep. All set.
"
14,5,Stan,"They want his power?
"
6,13,Cartman,"Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?
"
4,17,Kyle,"Nuh, you've gotta sound fatter.
"
7,12,Stan,"See? That's what happened to me!
"
9,8,Randy,"Yeah, me too.  Stephen, we've gotta keep moving! We're in deep hypothermia, all of us! We've gotta keep the blood flowing! 
"
7,11,Cartman,"Well fuck you, Kyle!! I hope you die! I hope you fucking die!! 
"
2,5,Kyle,"And then she walked over to--
"
5,6,Cartman,"Ye-You can't take my money, Goddamnit!
"
9,5,Randy,"Fort Collins can't play!
"
15,7,Kyle,"No, ah I didn't lie to you. Ah I was um... uh I felt better and then the guys called and said that they felt better and uh-
"
15,5,Cartman,"We need to speak with you, ma'am. 
"
6,10,Wendy,"I have three thousand dollars, cash. 
"
3,6,Kyle,"Dad?!
"
8,2,Timmy,"Otimmih. 
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"I warn you, Chef, don't even think of taking advantage of me in this prison cell.
"
5,9,Kyle,"Then why did you send us the goat?
"
7,14,Butters,"I'm fine. I miss you though.  Yeah, school was pretty tough today. We had two quizzes, and one of them was a pop quiz.  Sometimes I think our classes are too hard.  But I thought about you all day long. I promise. So how is your day going?
"
16,14,Kyle,"Dude, because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter.
"
17,9,Cartman,"I'll shit in your fuckin' garden!
"
6,1,Butters,"Hi, Mom and Dad!
"
18,9,Cartman,"This is the reason why our living rooms are dying, so we've got to do something.
"
15,2,Cartman,"Paradox...
"
6,3,Cartman,"Hey, I know how we get the balls on Butter's chin. Those Star Trek dorks down the street! They're always making crasy masks and special effects for their dumb movies.
"
2,9,Kyle,"Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!
"
18,8,Stan,"Not that. Did you actually go to that?
"
4,6,Mr. Garrison,"No-o!
"
15,11,Randy,"Really?
"
1,13,Stan,"Shhh! Here comes Cartman.
"
5,3,Stan,"Hi, Jesus. It's me,
"
14,4,Stan,"Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
"
13,13,Wendy,"Nobody expected you to fall in love with Smurfette. You went to learn from them, but instead you became one of them, right? Fought against your own kind when you knew we'd stop at nothing! Do you know that one Smurfberry can power the school for two months? One Smurfberry!
"
6,5,Butters,"Oh Jesus! Wait.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Oh, Jesus, this bus is going fast!  Oh, I did it again!!
"
3,5,Cartman,"Wow! Cool!
"
14,7,Kyle,"But he's just using his time on television to rant about-
"
18,7,Butters,"I don't know what you mean.
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
"
2,12,Mr. Garrison,"Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note!
"
9,6,Butters,"Huh?
"
1,9,Stan,"Hullo, we need to commit our friend, Kyle please.
"
6,14,Randy,"That's our Cartman. 
"
9,11,Cartman,"What do you mean, Kyle?
"
17,2,Randy,"Oh, I see. So when does the game start?
"
14,6,Stan,"Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad.
"
2,13,Cartman,"All right, get down. This is my kind of bullride.
"
17,10,Wendy,"See, that's the problem, Lisa. You have a bad self-image. Just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there, okay?
"
4,17,Kyle,"How hard can it be? Look at it. 
"
1,13,Stan,"We're sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money! 
"
10,9,Mr. Mackey,"All the girls go out in the hall please? I need to speak with the boys of this class, m'kay?  Boys, we have a very serious problem! I've just come from the men's restroom, and somebody went number 2 in the urinal! 
"
2,11,Kyle,"Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Do you know what it is to be a teacher, Ms....?
"
6,6,Cartman,"All right, the rest of you, thanks for coming. Get the fudge out! 
"
5,13,Cartman,"Oh, Kyle. Hey, what's goin' down, Jew-boy? 
"
9,12,Stan,"Okay, good! Do it! I'm not scared of you! Sue me!
"
3,13,Butters,"Yeah why, why, you shouldn't be such a smart-mouthed Mr. Know-It-All!
"
6,10,Butters,"Oooo, they're all hard and oogey!
"
16,6,Cartman,"You came for us!
"
5,2,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Wendy?
"
10,13,Cartman,"Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself.  Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii.
"
3,2,Stan,"Or else what?
"
12,13,Cartman,"I told you guys. He's been watching High School Musical over and over again.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Ih it sure is quiet up here in the mountains and it's dry, too. Do you have a humidi-humidifier?
"
8,8,Butters,"Hahaha, a turd sandwich!
"
7,9,Cartman,"Well what's the difference?! You love Christ, you're in love with Christ, I mean, uh, what the heck is this??
"
5,14,Butters,"Uh, that's me!
"
1,11,Wendy,"I couldn't help but notice you taking a liking to my boyfriend, Stan.
"
5,1,Kyle,"Do you really think anything's gonna be any different now?!  Do you really think that this will have the tiniest, smallest effect on the world?  It's still the same old world out there. Look.  What the hell?
"
9,7,Stan,"Woof.
"
17,1,Butters,"You see, Craig, once I came clean with the government, I no longer had anything to hide. Then I found peace. Have you read any DMV literature?
"
10,12,Butters,"But I just did what he told me!
"
5,7,Cartman,"AIDS?
"
11,13,Stan,"Please, ih ih, it won't take long.
"
12,9,Mr. Garrison,"Eric, for the love of Jesus...
"
12,13,Stan,"God damn it!  No matter what I do, this kid just won't stop.  And now they're gonna be in a show together? Jesus, it's all over for me.  They'll probably even have a kissing scene. What did I do to deserve this? And what am I suppose to do now?

Happy Birthday to...
"
5,13,Kyle,"...And see? Here's one from Butters. It says, ""We can't wait to see you back in school, Kenny."" And it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane! 
"
12,1,Cartman,"I'm sorry.
"
7,6,Cartman,"Jesus, we're too late.
"
4,17,Kyle,"What's a hard p?
"
14,5,Stan,"Dude, we can't do that
"
14,10,Kyle,"How do you know...  that wasn't your therapy? 
"
12,8,Cartman,"That's not cool Butters. You don't shoot a guy in the dick.
"
14,8,Butters,"Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her.
"
14,3,Cartman,"Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache.
"
16,13,Butters,"Yeah, and so, and so then, I asked Preacher, ""Well, what about the New Testament?""
"
14,3,Randy,"Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!
"
6,5,Stan,"Chips, pop, cookies, Kleenex, toilet paper, flares - we won't have to leave the TV room for anythng!
"
8,9,Randy,"Shhhhh! What are you talking about?
"
9,5,Butters,"I see a ladybug- Hello lady ladybug. 
"
7,11,Kyle,"Yeah. And then we can try the football field. 
"
10,6,Cartman,"You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!
"
4,1,Cartman,"Look, that's not important right now! Did you guys bring the cigarettes?
"
2,8,Stan,"I know! Let's go sledding!
"
8,11,Kyle,"It's not?
"
6,12,Stan,"No. Hello?? Kenny?? God??
"
8,7,Cartman,"Yeah, this is even gayer than all the men getting in a big pile and having sex with each other.
"
16,4,Cartman,"Isn't it possible I just want to learn more about the Jewish faith?
"
14,8,Cartman,"But  I'm gonna need your help.  Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get  psyched up??
"
6,4,Stan,"We're sorry, you are our friend. We need you to help us because friends stick together.
"
8,8,Randy,"So who won, Mr. Mackey?
"
3,17,Cartman,"That's nice. When I find it I'll just make you crap yourself so you look like Karen Carpenter.
"
8,11,Jimmy,"And that's all for Super School News. Enjoy your day at South Park Eh-Eh-Eh-Eh- &gt; Ehehehehe  Eh-Elementary. /&gt;
"
5,14,Butters,"Sure I do!
"
17,7,Cartman,"Sir Kyle, pre-order doesn't mean shit, okay? When you pre-order a game, you're just committing to paying for something that some assholes in California haven't even finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Oh, God-damnit! How am I gonna keep Butters down in that bomb shelter for a whole week?!
"
11,8,Cartman,"You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say!  I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! 
"
11,1,Randy,"You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
"
1,13,Stan,"Come on, what's the matter, Cartman?
"
18,9,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell is that?
"
10,12,Cartman,"How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
"
1,5,Stan,"Oh, uh gosh uh, I didn't really notice.
"
7,8,Cartman,"That's true, you guys. When the chicks at school see how gay we are, they're gonna be all over us.
"
3,1,Stan,"Jesus Christ!
"
8,11,Cartman,"You're helping Craig make his show?! I can't believe you would betray us like that! We've always been supercool to you! 
""Hahahahahaaahaaa! We're gonna do a news show, and you can't do it with us, because you are too poo-oor, and poor people don't watch the new-oos! Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa!""
Ah whatever, Kenny! 
"
4,2,Kyle,"No, Timmy, wait!
"
15,10,Stan,"No way.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Hey. Me and Cartman and Kenny are going down to Happy Burger. Do you wanna come?
"
6,5,Stan,"Come on, we gotta get to a TV! 
"
12,7,Butters,"Or the witty anecdotes of the townspeople, uh...
"
11,14,Cartman,"Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him.
"
11,2,Cartman,"You know God damned well what!
"
10,7,Cartman,"Mom, this is degrading!
"
11,1,Cartman,"Look, look how his face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!
"
11,12,Cartman,"Kyle?
"
4,9,Cartman,"Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding Form 22F. Do we all have that form? 
"
2,18,Cartman,"Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles.
"
9,14,Randy,"Alright... then you drive. 
"
5,7,Butters,"Oh, jeez. Ah I don't wanna get the AIDS, fellas.
"
4,15,Kyle,"That's 19 bucks, Kenny! 
"
18,7,Cartman,"How do you feel? Do you feel okay?
"
9,11,Stan,"What about the Foley family? I think they're all ginger.
"
2,13,Stan,"Oh-h. Nowhere. 
"
17,5,Kyle,"I don't know.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Okay. Go ahead, Kyle. Throw your nunchucks away. If you can. But you know damn well that your Jewish blood won't let you. You can't throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for. Go ahead and try.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Yeah. Yeah, of course. Let me get my coat. 
"
15,4,Randy,"This is a call to all angry people! We've had enough! We're gonna hit the government where it hurts! Right in the Federal Express!
"
15,7,Kyle,"Yeah they're the best!
"
5,1,Kenny,"(Uh oh.)
"
4,15,Mr. Mackey,"Uh what's all this about, Mrs. Cartman? Is Eric having trouble at havin' trouble at his weight-management camp?
"
4,1,Stan,"You got it!
"
2,15,Randy,"Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity.
"
17,10,Butters,"I do love water balloons. 
"
17,9,Cartman,"Oh dude, this is pretty sweet.
"
10,1,Kyle,"Come on, Chef! You can do it!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five.
"
7,8,Stan,"We're not straight! You're straight!
"
14,14,Randy,"Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?
"
4,14,Wendy,"Oh no! Oh no!!! 
"
1,7,Cartman,"It's Adolf Hitler costume. Sieg Heil, sieg heil.
"
2,10,Kyle,"What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?
"
4,3,Stan,"No, they can't! We've convinced them that they want to stay in America.
"
4,10,Stan,"Uh- Aw, dude, you screwed me up!
"
4,2,Stan,"You woke him up! 
"
4,7,Kenny,"(It's not that's fucking serious.) 
"
18,7,Butters,"Already? Oh no!
"
13,6,Randy,"Aw shit, it's Baby Fark McGee-zax!
"
10,10,Kyle,"Guys, can I talk to you?
"
4,9,Stan,"Yeah.
"
4,1,Stan,"We Killed Kenny. We're bastards. 
"
7,3,Cartman,"I'm killing you. But unfortunately I could only afford a Wiffle ball bat, so it's gonna take a while. 
"
10,12,Kyle,"Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient.
"
16,5,Stan,"How was I supposed to know Butters was actually a violent psychopath?
"
3,1,Kyle,"Hey, it's a fire. That means there must be people. 
"
14,3,Cartman,"What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay.  Put him on speaker.
"
12,3,Kyle,"Kenny? Kenny?!
"
6,17,Kyle,"Finally!
"
11,11,Butters,"Please, sir. I have to get home to my world.
"
1,9,Kyle,"I said Ike's on fire!
"
12,7,Cartman,"Waiwait, keep- you're fine.  Oh man, whoa!
"
7,7,Stan,"No!
"
17,2,Randy,"Oh we missed the murder! Did he cut them up?!
"
7,15,Kyle,"Who are you?
"
16,7,Cartman,"I almost got you! Almost! 
"
3,14,Cartman,"They mock us in Kansas, soldier. They think the South is a joke. They don't respect our authoritah.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Gaaah!  Heeee!
"
8,14,Stan,"Again?
"
1,11,Cartman,"You guys. Ya know what? My grandma was Dutch Irish, and my grandpa was lesbian - that makes me quarter-lesbian.
"
11,12,Butters,"Fellas! Where'd you come from? 
"
9,2,Stan,"Maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish, we should look at ourselves. I mean, is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long?
"
6,4,Cartman,"Where are we going?
"
7,2,Jimmy,"You get all the Crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night, Timmy. And I'll try to get all the ...Bloods there.
"
6,7,Cartman,"No, gallons.
"
1,11,Wendy,"Nooo!! Nooo!!
"
3,16,Stan,"What do you mean?
"
4,3,Stan,"Well, it's not good enough, Kenny! You have to get better! Try it again! 
"
3,10,Stan,"What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
"
4,2,Stan,"Totally, dude. Cherry Creek is the richest part of Denver. I'll bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the  ""Tooth Fairy.""
"
4,2,Cartman,"Weh-well, uh, du-don't take it too hard, dude, uh. That's what grown-ups do.They lie. Lie right to your face.
"
4,4,Stan,"Sounds good.
"
7,8,Cartman,"Yeah, don't be such a fag, dude! 
"
6,17,Cartman,"Uh... Oh! I brushed my teeth last night!
"
11,14,Cartman,"Bail, bail! 
"
14,14,Stan,"He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
"
1,4,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell is he talking about?!
"
6,12,Kyle,"Goddamnit! There has to be a way! 
"
8,2,Mr. Mackey,"Right. He's Jimmy, yeah.
"
8,1,Cartman,"Hey, fuck you, Kyle!
"
4,15,Cartman,"Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend.
"
17,5,Kyle,"Ike, I just want us to be friends again.
"
18,2,Randy,"How's your mom? Your, your sister?
"
4,15,Stan,"We knew he wouldn't make it.
"
9,9,Butters,"I can't do it, fellas. I can't go into a girls' slumber party! What if they find out I ain't a girl?
"
7,6,Butters,"Ah, I was at home.
"
11,1,Stan,"Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!
"
5,14,Butters,"That's me!
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, can somebody get me some paper towels?? Or maybe a  Ooowww, okay!  Ooohhh, it's bad!
"
10,9,Kyle,"...Really??
"
4,1,Stan,"Dude, bail! Bail! 
"
4,15,Cartman,"No.
"
3,12,Kenny,"(Hey, guys. Uh, check out this kick-ass cool costume.)
"
7,9,Cartman,"Because, Token, we have to take pictures for our album cover.  The key to a hot-selling Christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover.
"
15,1,Cartman,"No, because the battery is dead; it just ran out of power!
"
3,5,Kyle,"Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. 
"
2,13,Kyle,"How many ball does that get us?
"
13,3,Kyle,"There's no choice anymore, guys. Don't worry about me. I've been preparing for this for a while now. 
"
8,3,Kyle,"But how can the Jews make it better??
"
11,14,Wendy,"Is that a lace across the top?
"
15,7,Randy,"Why can't you ever just support me?!
"
4,6,Cartman,"...Sweet.
"
6,14,Stan,"Are we homophobes now?
"
7,15,Cartman,"How much further to Ottawa! Christmas is only twelve hours away.
"
6,5,Cartman,"All right!
"
16,4,Kyle,"These people aren't going to prove anything. To believe any of this you either have to be a liar, or stupid.
"
14,1,Butters,"Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore.
"
17,1,Cartman,"Alright, listen. I'm gonna get a job at the NSA, and then I'm gonna put all their secrets up on Twitter.
"
17,9,Stan,"Oh, okay I guess that makes sense, but... Butters and Scott won't be able to get their PS4s.
"
1,10,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah, crazy. 
"
10,2,Kyle,"Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! 
"
11,7,Cartman,"Let's hope to Christ this works. 
"
3,10,Kyle,"But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. 
"
7,8,Stan,"Hey, what's goin' on?
"
8,5,Cartman,"I have been sent from Japan to serve as your personal robot.
"
9,3,Cartman,"Sweet!
"
15,10,Cartman,"Uh, hey Jenny. Sup?
"
1,10,Kyle,"Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh they, they do, huh?
"
3,13,Kyle,"What's a ""home-schooled kid""?
"
18,5,Cartman,"Dude, what's the matter?
"
12,2,Kyle,"Dude! 
"
13,10,Kenny,"(Yep.)
"
1,8,Stan,"Yeah? Yeah. We want to adopt a starving Ethernopian.
"
2,12,Kyle,"Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives! 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Nooohohohohohoho-
"
5,13,Cartman,"Guess what I have sitting in my back yard?
"
12,3,Kenny,"(I'm not ruining my life, okay, you God damned fucking psychos.)
"
11,2,Cartman,"It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Huh? Oh, fine. We were just about to run it from the top.
"
4,3,Stan,"Hurry up, you guys!
"
2,13,Kenny,"(Okay.)
"
17,3,Cartman,"Sweet.  Hey Jimmy, what are you doin'?
"
2,15,Stan,"Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?
"
13,13,Stan,"What?!
"
5,8,Cartman,"You're the worst character ever, Towelie.
"
5,2,Stan,"Alright, this looks like the perfect place to get some signatures. 
"
16,8,Randy,"Yeah, it's awesome to be on your show.
"
11,12,Kyle,"I know.
"
7,1,Kyle,"Whoa Cartman. Looks like you didn't get much sleep last night.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh my God. 
"
12,8,Cartman,"...It's not okay! Defeating the Chinese won't mean anything if we do it by going around shooting people in the dick!  God damn it!
"
17,10,Butters,"Ah I think she's a nice girl too. She's just too big for me.
"
4,1,Kyle,"Awwgh! Hey dude, we don't even have enough weight to move.
"
11,2,Butters,"...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright.
"
17,10,Wendy,"What? What do you mean?
"
18,2,Randy,"What am I supposed to eat?
"
14,10,Stan,"Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?
"
1,1,Stan,"Gee, the bus'll be here any minute, and Cartman still isn't around.
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"I thought of it yesterday!
"
5,3,Cartman,"Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
"
10,8,Cartman,"Clyde, Clyde!  If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it?  I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?
"
3,5,Randy,"Jakovasaurs don't wear clothes, Jakov.
"
9,11,Cartman,"We gingers are proud people! We are the noble descendants of great Americans like Ron Howard, and ...others! We will not be discriminated against any longer, for we are a great race!
"
14,8,Butters,"I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
"
1,10,Stan,"Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.
"
8,2,Kyle,"Because! 
"
13,9,Wendy,"Stan!
"
6,8,Kyle,"What?
"
11,11,Cartman,"No! Kyle can't die. 
"
12,3,Kyle,"Dude! Dude, Kenny, calm down!
"
12,14,Butters,"What's that, Dad?
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Yes.
"
15,5,Cartman,"I know, right? I was always extra good before my birthday too because I was told Slash would come and play for me.
"
1,4,Stan,"Uh, hi, Jesus. I, I have a dog, and he's a- he's a homosexual.
"
1,10,Stan,"Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best.  She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!
"
6,5,Butters,"I told you, we can't go to my house!
"
10,6,Kyle,"You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!
"
8,9,Stan,"Yeah, but Dad, the whole town agreed not to shop at Wall-Mart anymore.
"
10,7,Stan,"Where am I supposed to get a gun?
"
1,7,Stan,"We were going to enter the costume contest as a pair.
"
5,13,Cartman,"Are you through databasing the clientele sheet?
"
15,7,Stan,"But it's just crap.
"
6,17,Cartman,"I'm just letting you know how special you are to me.
"
4,3,Randy,"Ew, Dad! Not in front of Stanley!
"
1,10,Stan,"You're gonna fight Satan?
"
10,13,Cartman,"Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome!  Get out of my way!
"
1,7,Cartman,"Check.
"
18,8,Cartman,"Ah, dude, your dad's here.
"
15,11,Randy,"Look, I thought Broadway musicals weren't for me either, but I just didn't know about the whole subtext thing, you know? I couldn't really appreciate 'em till now.
"
4,9,Stan,"Really?
"
3,3,Kyle,"What's tree-fitty?
"
15,5,Kyle,"Why do they have to put this on TV?! 
"
9,11,Cartman,"I'M GINGER!
"
6,4,Cartman,"Thank God we stopped it in time.
"
2,17,Kyle,"What?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn't even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you're no better than a Jew.
"
12,9,Wendy,"Yes sir.
"
2,18,Stan,"Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? 
"
4,17,Stan,"Yeah. And you know? I think I've learned something today, it doesn't matter if you're Christian or Jewish or Atheist or Hindu.  Christmas still is about one very important thing.
"
6,13,Stan,"Where?!
"
16,5,Butters,"Trapped inside the darkness of my mind.
I try to break free. The words are so unkind.
"
6,4,Butters,"No no no no no! I can't bring cows into my house. I'll get grounded.
"
9,9,Cartman,"Okay, it's ready! Step down, Butters. 
"
13,3,Stan,"What?
"
3,13,Butters,"Yeah. He's a badass! 
"
11,3,Kyle,"Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Hey gay-butts, what's goin' on?
"
5,5,Kyle,"You bastards!
"
17,6,Cartman,"Okay okay Jesus, uh, lay down on your back, Kyle.  Let's see what I can muster up here.
"
2,9,Kyle,"They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
"
1,7,Stan,"What are we doing here Chef?
"
4,3,Stan,"Dude, you're not gonna believe this.
"
18,7,Butters,"Nuh uh!
"
6,12,Cartman,"You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! 
"
2,17,Kyle,"We're his oral report buddies.
"
1,13,Kenny,"(Guuyys! Could you please make it stoopp?!!)
"
7,11,Cartman,"Totally. 
"
3,6,Stan,"Dude, are we glad to find you! You have to come back to South Park, quick!
"
8,6,Kyle,"Yeah, I think they already moved in. I saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago.
"
18,7,Butters,"YES.
"
1,12,Cartman,"Thanks for your help! Visit us again!
"
10,14,Stan,"But it isn't supposed to end like this!
"
11,2,Cartman,"It's a picture ...of me.  And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.
"
14,5,Cartman,"I tried getting one last week!
"
13,9,Butters,"Mmmwhoa boy!
"
2,8,Cartman,"Later's fine.
"
13,4,Cartman,"It's my Goddamned house, now get your bitch ass on the floor! 
"
9,10,Wendy,"I want to see my egg.
"
11,9,Stan,"I take it back!
"
3,6,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
5,10,Cartman,"Hoh, Oh my God! More people have to see this picture, you guys. I'm gonna put it on the Internet or... No, wait! Kenny.  I just had the greatest idea... ever!
"
4,12,Kyle,"What do you mean, ""can't""?! You made it work; just build us another one!
"
5,3,Kyle,"Wow, that's cool!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, what's Vietnam?
"
14,2,Butters,"Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon...  Kill John Lennon!  Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?
"
15,1,Kyle,"(You're fine!)
"
6,12,Cartman,"That explains it. Why I'm having Kenny's memories all the time. His soul is inside me.
"
3,15,Stan,"It fell;
"
10,9,Mr. Mackey,"No, I'm not saying they're related!
"
13,9,Cartman,"Alright, your turn Craig.
"
11,1,Randy,"Yeah... No problem...
"
9,10,Cartman,"...No.
"
6,9,Stan,"Okay, go. 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Boyongture taur lur mahrter.
"
10,11,Stan,"It does work!!
"
16,6,Kyle,"Zipline. 
"
7,5,Cartman,"Nobody
"
4,3,Kyle,"What?! 
"
11,3,Cartman,"That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!
"
16,14,Butters,"Okay! Okay! He's helping Oblamew pablama beblab.
"
10,1,Kyle,"Dude, what are you doing?!
"
3,4,Kyle,"Do you wanna bet?
"
6,11,Randy,"Your ancestors put up a great wall that kept Mongolians out for thousands of years. We know you can do it for us.
"
6,7,Stan,"Yeah.
"
4,2,Kenny,"(Woohoo!)
"
3,6,Stan,"Bad.
"
2,15,Randy,"Sharon?
"
3,17,Stan,"We busted you!
"
6,8,Kyle,"So you crapped out of your mouth! Good for you! It's still stupid and immature! 
"
18,5,Kenny,"(Stop taping!)
"
15,2,Stan,"Nono, you guys gotta see Funnybot in Hangover 3. I'm telling you, it's his best work.
"
5,2,Timmy,"Hahnah Timmih.
"
2,13,Cartman,"Oh! Son of a bitch!
"
18,4,Timmy,"Timmy! 
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Why don't we at least give it a chance? I mean,  Come on! 
"
13,10,Kyle,"How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
"
18,7,Cartman,"Right Butters.  These guys are so dumb, huh?
"
17,7,Cartman,"Fine! If you guys don't wanna join us on Black Friday to get XBoxes, then that's fine!
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"You're the ones who made it this way!
"
1,12,Cartman,"Well, I guess we'll have to roshambo for it.
"
11,5,Stan,"First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!
"
8,14,Stan,"Well, you're mountain lions.
"
7,7,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah.  So long, South Park.
"
7,11,Cartman,"You... your Mom said you could take three friends.
"
4,10,Stan,"Mom, wuh we're staying for Sunday school.
"
11,4,Kyle,"...Not anymore you're not.
"
2,10,Kyle,"Are you old Frida?
"
13,4,Butters,"This is gonna be great!
"
1,11,Stan,"I'll kick your ass, Cartman! 
"
14,14,Stan,"Awww what?!
"
10,9,Kyle,"Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??
"
9,1,Cartman,"This is ridiculous. Jews can't play basketball.
"
1,11,Kyle,"Dude! I aced that test! I'm gonna win that dinner with Ms. Ellen!
"
6,14,Butters,"No more... arts and crafts...
"
5,6,Stan,"That does it, dude!
"
8,4,Butters,"Wow, neat-o, a competition? Why, I'd love to. What kind of competition is it?
"
2,7,Stan,"Yeah, I must be having some real emotional problems.
"
12,9,Wendy,"Mom, you don't-
"
13,6,Randy,"Oh yeah!  Oh yeah!  Suck on that, Hollis!
"
12,13,Stan,"I mean, I see the way you two are together and I don't wanna be in your way.
"
4,6,Cartman,"...You see.  Gaw, this is just what I've been talkin' about! I can't even relate to you guys anymore because you're too immature!
"
2,8,Stan,"How many days left in summer?
"
16,7,Cartman,"Yes, I do, Cupid Me. Love is the bestest feeling in the world. I believe you can change everything.
"
4,4,Kenny,"(Hello, Chef.)
"
13,9,Kenny,"(Stacey Anderson?) 
"
6,8,Randy,"A Catholic boat trip? 
"
5,4,Timmy,"Timmay!
"
4,14,Cartman,"You say, ""No, Timmy, you can't have that turkey! Bad Timmy!""
"
8,11,Cartman,"How many students is that?
"
10,2,Kyle,"Yeah, fine, Dad.
"
5,1,Kyle,"...No.
"
18,7,Cartman,"Okay Kyle.
"
15,2,Cartman,"Oh, man, did you guys see Funnybot on ""Saturday Night Live""?
"
17,10,Wendy,"This is a fantasy, you moron! You ever heard of Photoshop?! Kim Kardashian is a short, overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves!
"
3,6,Kyle,"Dad? Don't you think our last new house is big enough?
"
12,6,Stan,"Don', don't cry, Shelly. You'll be able to get online when we get to Californee. 
"
5,8,Kyle,"Okay, turn it on.
"
1,13,Cartman,"I'm your son, Eric. My mom says you put your who-who-dilly in her cha-cha, at the Drunken Barn Dance.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Alright, Mr. Worf. Then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers.
"
6,14,Mr. Garrison,"There! I've done it, Mr. Slave. The perfect plan to get us fired. You finished your costume design yet?
"
2,12,Stan,"This is happening way too fast.
"
3,1,Kyle,"Yeah. I think we should get the hell out of here.
"
2,16,Cartman,"Yes! Move it! 
"
11,8,Kyle,"Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!
"
7,7,Randy,"Well like, you know, Slurpees and stuff. 
"
5,5,Kyle,"But the guy who replaced him sucks!
"
15,10,Kyle,"Here's a shoebox! 
"
9,6,Butters,"Go in there? Uh, but they'll see me.
"
18,1,Cartman,"We made it, guys. We cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4, 3, 2, 1 that's the deadline!
"
12,9,Cartman,"Damned straight! I just got all punk rock and got detention, you know! I'm just a bad dude.
"
2,6,Stan,"Dude, it's just a plastic frog; it's not real. Check it out!
"
13,10,Jimmy,"You have to forfeit the fight, Rad Russian! You cannot fight until your test results come ba-back
"
6,7,Cartman,"I'm gonna send a message to my people and tell 'em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size, so I can live amongst them forever.
"
7,14,Kyle,"Why?
"
9,14,Randy,"I've got a disease: Alcoholism. It's pretty serious. You?
"
17,9,Cartman,"I just... I can't get the image of Bill Gates... bashing that guy's head apart out of my eyes.
"
2,2,Kyle,"What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
"
6,12,Cartman,"Alright, look. I didn't wanna have to say this, but I think maybe we're not seeing heaven because one of us doesn't believe in it enough.
"
6,5,Kyle,"God-dammit! If we miss the commercials, I'll never forgive my brother!
"
9,11,Cartman,"Yes, but I'm not going to die.  That's why we gotta get along, people!
"
11,5,Kyle,"The history of Easter.
"
12,13,Cartman,"""That was supposed to be my power-up pack, I'm Scott Malkinson and I have diabetes.""
"
12,11,Cartman,"Dude, that's awesome.
"
13,10,Stan,"What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother.  And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. 
"
9,12,Kenny,"(Hey yeah!)
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Nobody cared about my standup comedy! All that hard work just to be outshined by C-Christopher Reeve the super b-butthole!
"
1,5,Stan,"Stop!
"
1,8,Stan,"Dude, the mutant turkeys are back! 
"
3,5,Stan,"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!
"
18,9,Kyle,"You're watching someone play Call Of Duty and talk about it?
"
18,10,Stan,"That's a little strange, isn't it?
"
1,13,Cartman,"Liane Cartman.
"
4,12,Stan,"Back in the third grade.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Kenny didn't have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.
"
10,3,Stan,"Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy.
"
2,16,Stan,"I hope you can forgive me, too, Mom.
"
11,5,Randy,"Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever.
"
9,14,Randy,"'Scuse me, I-I'd like to address the group if I may.
"
4,8,Cartman,"Whoa! Calm down, ho. 
"
6,5,Stan,"Yeahyeah, how do you change the channels?
"
15,1,Stan,"No, we don't want a replacement friend, we want our friend.
"
13,9,Butters,"Boy, how do you like that, bitches? Approval for two housing loans and tax-exempt status. File these away, Sally.
"
5,4,Stan,"Got what all figured out?
"
2,15,Cartman,"P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?
"
4,7,Kenny,"(Ten million dollars??)
"
8,9,Cartman,"Haha. You fools have no idea that I would never let you hurt the Wall-Mart.
"
5,8,Kyle,"HA! I killed you!
"
18,1,Kyle,"Yeah. I guess... I guess everything is.
"
1,1,Stan,"Hey, I didn't throw up.
"
11,7,Stan,"Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. 
"
1,6,Stan,"Sure.
"
2,6,Stan,"Come on, Cartman, the way we're filming this, nobody will even know it's you.
"
5,7,Cartman,"Yeah, but it makes going to the bathroom easier. 
"
3,13,Stan,"Hey, fatass, how's home-schooling going?
"
7,3,Kyle,"You can't kill all three of us, Cartman!
"
6,1,Kyle,"City Wok brought him down to a size 4.
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"These pictures just arrived.  I set up a camera, and caught Mr. Twig's assailant red-handed.  Now, go arrest him!  What..?
"
7,6,Cartman,"Hey! Broflovski's a good cop!
"
11,9,Randy,"Aw crap!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Look, guys, we're sorry we tried to murder you, but... You have to stop what you're doing!
"
16,13,Mr. Mackey,"Oh you do? Ya you got you got those? Okay, okay, that's good! Good you're doin' something about it, m'kay.  Uh hey kids. Kids over here...
"
4,1,Cartman,"Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!
"
6,16,Randy,"AAAHHH! Oh my God! Look!  What? His hand did disappear! He is you from the future!
"
3,10,Stan,"Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!
"
14,1,Butters,"Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy.
"
7,15,Cartman,"And... I'm not going to get any Christmas presents. 
"
9,12,Stan,"Fine.
"
6,14,Kyle,"Eh I, I don't know what else to paint.
"
15,12,Cartman,"Stephen Tamil? The fifth grader?  Oh shit!  I told you to lock that door, Token!  No.  Nononono!  Where are they Kenny??!!
"
2,12,Kyle,"I dunno.
"
12,9,Jimmy,"I always knew deep down that Wendy didn't have any ba-ba-balls.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Hey. Ms. Crabtree had that little TV, for the trainng video? Maybe we can watch TV on it.
"
6,17,Stan,"I hope so, or else Santa Claus is as good as dead.
"
12,13,Kenny,"(Yeah.)
"
7,13,Kyle,"What are you doing? 
"
6,7,Butters,"Aaaaah!
"
4,4,Mr. Garrison,"Timmy, did you not do your homework?!
"
8,13,Cartman,"How come the outline is missing its hand?
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"Yes, I need a gun.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Yeah. Closure.
"
9,11,Kyle,"Because now he's acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers. When he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isn't really ginger, it'll be hysterical!
"
3,8,Randy,"What's happened to you?! You've become all needy and talkative and-!
"
16,3,Cartman,"Cool, these will be good uploads.
"
7,6,Kyle,"Cool! We'll see what we can find, ma'am.
"
5,11,Kyle,"Well, I- I invested in that IT thing, and there was a bailout, so I received a five million dollar bailout clause check, which, which I can use to help my family, so, I- I guess, goodbye, cousin. 
"
9,12,Stan,"Look, everybody, we're all looking for answer, you know. We all want to understand who we are and where we come from, but... sometimes we want to know the answers so badly that we... believe just about anything.
"
10,10,Kyle,"Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student.
"
1,4,Stan,"Come on you guys, I have an idea.
"
13,7,Kyle,"""Dear Mommy and Daddy: I am running away. I am sorry, but I can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life. Everyone at school is a fucking idiot, and if one more person talked to me about that Susan Boyle performance of Les Misérables I was going to puke my balls out through my mouth. I love you all, but I have to move on. I'm going to Somalia to be a-"" to be a pirate?! Oh shit!
"
6,16,Stan,"Quit it.
"
17,2,Wendy,"Ugh, Jesus! 
"
3,14,Stan,"Cartman, you can't do that!
"
12,1,Cartman,"NO! No-al-, all right Kyle! Magic Johnson, Kyle! The key is Magic Johnson.
"
16,14,Butters,"Please, Eric! I tried to be quiet, I swear!
"
11,5,Randy,"It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.
"
3,14,Stan,"Awwww!
"
2,14,Mr. Garrison,"It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--
"
9,12,Stan,"Yeah. Yeah, I get you.
"
2,7,Cartman,"I wonder when the monster is gonna come back to feed again? 
"
12,13,Kyle,"Where did everybody go?
"
10,8,Kyle,"Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?
"
14,3,Randy,"Alright, see you tomorrow!  Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes!  Huh-oh Jesus!  Ugh, ohh.  Uhh, hey, can somebody..?  ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home.  Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. 
"
11,13,Stan,"But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.
"
7,4,Stan,"You're gonna read this stuff and study like the rest of us!
"
12,5,Kenny,"(Yeah, that was my idea.)
"
10,2,Randy,"And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!
"
14,8,Kenny,"(No! NASCAR fans aren't stupid! Cartman is!)
"
7,9,Kyle,"So, he's gonna get it, right?
"
1,9,Kyle,"Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I will play
Second verse, same as the first
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidelll-I ma...
"
5,1,Cartman,"Jeez, you're a little irritable, Kyle. What's the matter? You got some sand in your vagina?
"
16,2,Cartman,"Yeah, listen, I'm running a retail business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours.
"
11,7,Cartman,"Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do.
"
10,3,Kyle,"You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air!
"
1,7,Stan,"Oh my God, that means...
"
8,12,Wendy,"We're gonna miss what?
"
2,6,Cartman,"Sent her away where?
"
2,4,Kyle,"Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?
"
6,16,Randy,"I think he IS from the future.
"
18,9,Kyle,"Hey Ike, you wanna come watch TV with me?
"
1,5,Kyle,"He recognizes you dude.
"
8,1,Stan,"All right. Now we just gotta sneak him into town.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Here we are at the old gas station. It survived a lot of the impact. We might be safe here.  Oh my God!
"
2,13,Kyle,"You will?
"
9,8,Kyle,"Cartman flooded Beaverton?!!
"
6,16,Stan,"Butters!
"
14,7,Kyle,"If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im.
"
7,10,Randy,"Sharon, have you seen Dad?
"
8,13,Cartman,"I'm gonna!
"
17,3,Cartman,"Not a chance. By now most of the urban cities will be compromised. This whole things from city to city. We need to go somewhere the trend won't take hold. Like Iceland. 
"
18,6,Kenny,"(Jimmy.)
"
5,9,Cartman,"Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it.
"
8,11,Stan,"Yeah, I think that was one of our best shows yet.
"
16,7,Kyle,"What the hell are you doing telling people that we're a gay couple?!
"
11,6,Jimmy,"Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report and, I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul. 
"
11,8,Cartman,"Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true.  Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! 
"
11,12,Stan,"What??
"
1,6,Stan,"See, I told you dude.
"
2,8,Kyle,"Dusty the dirtball
"
7,10,Randy,"GET OFF THE STREETS!  GET OFF THE STREETS! 
"
9,8,Randy,"What is it, son?
"
13,12,Cartman,"Piss off, you stupid assholes! 
"
6,9,Stan,"Alright, let's go get the gymnasium ready. Tweek, you go make fifty hats. 
"
14,4,Stan,"Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!
"
4,14,Cartman,"No, Timmy! That handicapped turkey does not go in our play!
"
1,5,Cartman,"If a woman ever gave me crap, I'd say, ""Hey, you go do my laundry and-""
"
16,1,Butters,"Wait a minute! You're supposed to poop on the toilet facing out?  But I thought you sit on the toilet this way.  So that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk? Well, because you got the flusher right here. No?  Oh jeez, that's embarrassing.
"
3,1,Stan,"I don't wanna burrito, I want a taco. Supreme.
"
1,8,Cartman,"But I'm not a starving Etheropian! I have to get back home too!
"
6,8,Kyle,"In your butts?
"
3,13,Randy,"Uhwhy do we want to all chaperone the dance?
"
6,17,Cartman,"Oh, heh. Are the uh tabulations all closed up then?
"
3,1,Cartman,"Nononono! You nyah, me nyah!  Screw you guys, I'ma going home.
"
13,1,Butters,"Hey, you guys! You guys, I think we have a big problem!
"
1,9,Kyle,"It isn't fair!  I don't want to be an outcast!
"
6,6,Cartman,"Just one more rose left, Kyle. Who does it go to?
"
8,4,Cartman,"Ha! You just got f'd in the a!
"
2,7,Cartman,"Aw damn, man. Now I'm missing the new Barnaby Jones.
"
2,8,Cartman,"Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song! 
"
17,8,Randy,"Well, you're about to be.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(Hey cool! Check it out!)
"
13,10,Butters,"He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
"
2,7,Kyle,"Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
"
5,2,Stan,"When do we want it?
"
2,16,Cartman,"I told you guys. The holiday season is nothing but lies and bullcrap!
"
4,17,Kyle,"Ah.
"
7,11,Cartman,"Right now we're walking by what used to be people's houses, now just smoldering burnt piles of rubble.
"
16,12,Stan,"Trick or treat.
"
16,10,Kyle,"You guys can't tell anybody, all right? Not until I figure out what to do.
"
7,9,Cartman,"Gentlemen, we are about to embark on the most amazing, life-affirming, financially windfalling experiences of our young lives.
"
16,14,Kyle,"Then just tell me what Cartman is up to!
"
6,5,Stan,"No! Shelly, we have to watch HBC! 
"
13,1,Stan,"All right, come on guys, we're not sitting back and watching our friend die! 
"
1,2,Mr. Garrison,"You talkin' to me?  You talkin' to me? I don't know, it's a little small.
"
8,11,Stan,"But that's... that's crap! That's not even TV!
"
3,14,Cartman,"Now our numbers are truly great. It is time. It is time to march to Washington D.C.!
"
6,1,Butters,"Me?!
"
4,17,Randy,"That is the spirit of Christmas. Commercialism. Because it's what makes our country work!
"
2,12,Wendy,"Kiss Bebe on the lips!
"
17,8,Butters,"Yeah!
"
14,5,Stan,"Aww... he was packing fudge!
"
2,11,Kyle,"Kenny! What's it doing? 
"
3,8,Stan,"Rad! 
"
2,11,Cartman,"Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake! 
"
3,14,Randy,"Awgh, I can't drink anymore of that stuff.
"
3,2,Stan,"Dad, where's the phone book?
"
14,3,Cartman,"Colonel, how are you doing?
"
16,5,Cartman,"Nonono, I'm tellin' you guys, music videos have devolved to nothing but pretty girls wearing skin-tight clothes, and singin' songs about their vajayjays. Used to be chicks sang about their relationships; now it's all ""my vajayjay this, my vajayjay that."" But clearly that's what sells. Think about it. When was the last time you turned on a music video and didn't see some chick strumming a guitar singing about her vajayjay?  See? You can't remember.
"
10,10,Cartman,"Boyarrrgh!  Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!
"
3,11,Cartman,"Ms. Struthers. You helped so many people, and you've taught us that helping people is what life is all about. All we wanna do is... be like you. 
"
2,9,Stan,"Shut up, Cartman!  Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. 
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hey, sucky-sucky? Only ten dollar.
"
2,10,Cartman,"We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.
"
2,18,Stan,"O-okay.
"
14,2,Cartman,"Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!
"
17,8,Kyle,"Cartman, we should probably talk about our chances.
"
16,2,Stan,"I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Oh, and what?! I deserve it?! Is that what you think?!
"
1,10,Stan,"Up yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. 
"
8,2,Cartman,"God-damnit!
"
8,1,Kyle,"Listen, doucher! Our parents are gonna kill us, and you, if they found out that we bought these!
"
18,5,Butters,"Why would you turn ""Craig's mom's bush"" into a music video starring us?!
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"White Power! White Power!
"
7,13,Cartman,"Hey, maybe that's it, you guys. Maybe the tobacco company can help us! 
"
5,2,Timmy,"Yahahah!!!
"
11,4,Stan,"You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. 
"
17,7,Stan,"It is real. They do it every year. But everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on Black Friday. What chance do we have?
"
3,5,Cartman,"Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny?
"
1,5,Kyle,"Try it.  We'll see you in a while, we got to go get Cartman's pig.
"
2,9,Stan,"Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?
"
1,1,Kyle,"You know what you assholes like! You like to fuck! And shit! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck! And fuck!
"
13,3,Cartman,"The Jews took all the money away, and they ha-!
"
12,14,Butters,"Sorry, Eric, but I am a vampire now, and I can no longer survive on human food. And if someone must die so that I can feed, I choose thee.  Hm, wonder which side I'm supposed to do it on, hm. Probably doesn't matter. 
"
1,1,Cartman,"That's 'cause I was having these... bogus nightmares.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Okay, bye. 
"
2,10,Kyle,"D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!
"
17,1,Cartman,"Okaaay.  I just want hot tea and codeine, no lemon.
"
15,2,Jimmy,"Now look, I know that I've put every comedian in the world out of work, but you have to admit that in a lot of ways, the first annual Comedy Awards was a success.
"
18,1,Kenny,"(Dilapidated titties incorporated.)
"
11,2,Butters,"Really?
"
3,17,Mr. Mackey,"Alright, come on, everybody. We've got a long bus ride back to Colorado, m'kay? 
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"The what??
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Yeahmkay?
"
2,13,Kyle,"No, it's not cool!
"
5,2,Randy,"Nice to meet you.
"
4,9,Timmy,"Timmiihh! 
"
2,5,Stan,"AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
"
10,11,Butters,"Oh hamburgers!
"
5,5,Stan,"But we need you!
"
6,4,Cartman,"No. See, must say, ""Captain, where am I supposed to drive to?""
"
4,9,Cartman,"Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. 
"
12,14,Butters,"Ugh.  Kenny, there's a vampire on the loose. He and Katie Gelson was hanging out with him, and now she's a vampire too!
"
2,14,Stan,"Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail.
"
15,4,Randy,"Seven centimeters...
"
9,4,Kenny,"(I could get to level sixty!)
"
2,8,Mr. Garrison,"Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing.
"
11,3,Cartman,"Oh I get it.  This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!
"
14,9,Cartman,"Thank you, Kyle.
"
6,16,Cartman,"Well first it's not extreme enough and then it's too extreme; where do you want it?
"
13,12,Stan,"That, that lady said it's because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary. So we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition.
"
1,13,Mr. Mackey,"Oooh okay... Eric is obviously suffering from some kind of emotional distress, mkay?
"
2,10,Mr. Garrison,"Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?
"
13,5,Cartman,"Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let's be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn't work with someone who's disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy's disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. 
"
3,11,Kyle,"Cartman!
"
7,2,Stan,"Cartman, trust me.  We don't want any part in this one.
"
5,5,Cartman,"Look, if you don't come and do the show, I'll make you eat your parents!
"
3,2,Stan,"Is this what you're looking for, Kyle?
"
9,3,Stan,"Uhh, all right. We'll call you after she goes on TV.
"
3,16,Stan,"Are you there, God? It's me, Stan. If you wouldn't mind, I don't wanna be the only kid who doesn't get his period before the new year. Could you speed up my development a little? Thanks, God. Your friend, Stan 
"
12,1,Cartman,"Don't you get it?! We are two pals afflicted with an illness, and who only have each other in a race against time! Innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason!
"
8,1,Stan,"Ninja positions!  Hello, Craig!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Hey, you guys, you know what we should do? We should go show our weapons to Craig and those guys. They'll be so jealous.
"
16,6,Cartman,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
"
7,14,Cartman,"What a whore! 
"
18,8,Kyle,"You were?
"
13,9,Butters,"What's that?
"
6,6,Butters,"Oh! Ah, I'm back from the bathroom. Ah I really let one go in there.
"
7,13,Kyle,"Well it's just that, eh, this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands, you know? It's been happening a lot lately. How about this time we just put a stop to it right now?
"
13,9,Kyle,"So what?
"
11,14,Kyle,"Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and...  Me?
"
11,13,Kyle,"Thanks, Mick! 
"
8,8,Kyle,"Well yeah, but not if your decision is for Turd Sandwich! What the hell is wrong with you?!
"
12,13,Cartman,"Oh that's good that's good. Yeah. Shoot that guy in the face, Kyle.  Yeah, nice.
"
9,6,Butters,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 
"
12,12,Randy,"Hey, come on people. We can keep partying, can't we? Yes we can! Come on, let's sing. O-bama. Well you came and you gave without taking.  And I sent you away, O-bama. When you kissed me and stopped me from shakin'. 
"
11,2,Cartman,"...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. 
"
3,2,Stan,"Huh I don't know. I'm going home, I guess.
"
13,9,Kyle,"Butters, I really think we should talk.
"
2,9,Kyle,"We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey. 
"
4,7,Mr. Garrison,"Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe.
"
12,9,Butters,"That way it won't matter if you get detention.
"
11,2,Butters,"Wuh-what's the matter?
"
6,3,Butters,"Oh, Jesus, see me through this.
"
8,3,Stan,"Oh, we will! This is America! And in America, if something sucks, you're supposed to be able to get your money back! Come on, Kenny! 
"
15,3,Mr. Mackey,"Oho... Oh God... Go on home, kids. M'kay? It's over!
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"They took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours!
"
13,14,Stan,"Not... all the time.
"
8,10,Cartman,"Don't call me fat, you stupid Jew!
"
2,18,Cartman,"You son of a bitch cat!
"
2,2,Stan,"Oh man.  I'm gonna be sick.
"
9,3,Cartman,"You've ...already done all the work?
"
8,8,Cartman,"All right turd sandwich!
"
2,10,Kyle,"Yeah. I feel great!
"
13,7,Kyle,"Oh God. What have I done?
"
17,8,Cartman,"Uhhh, hmmm. What?
"
8,10,Kyle,"From who? We can't ask adults for help and there's nobody tougher than sixth graders.
"
15,2,Cartman,"Here we go, this has gotta be it right here. 
"
16,7,Cartman,"It's NOT gonna be okay! Why did they break up?! They were meant for each other!
"
16,10,Cartman,"Oh?! Ohhh?!  Yes? Yeah, hello?
"
2,9,Kyle,"Sick, Kenny.
"
17,9,Stan,"Who is that?
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"There's a box next to Filmore's name and a box next to Ike's! What's not to understand?
"
3,5,Cartman,"No. That's okay. I'll see you guys. 
"
12,3,Kyle,"Dad! Somebody's at the front door!  Well am I grounded or not?!  Ugh. Fine! I'll get it! 
"
16,14,Cartman,"Yeah, I figured. It's the day after the election, so you're probably sitting on the couch telling your little brother how great it is to live in a democratic society.  Listen, Kyle, could you come over for a second? I got somethin' I need to show you.
"
9,5,Stan,"Hey yeah. We need to find the very worst kid athlete in the whole world. Somebody who can't possibly win.
"
16,10,Randy,"How did you get rid of him?  How did you get rid of the milkman?
"
16,14,Cartman,"I was always told that... we lived in a country based on freedom. That the one thing that made America different was that government could never barge into our lives unwarranted. But it's all changing, isn't it? Ever since Obama was first elected, it's all changing.
"
11,3,Cartman,"I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice.  We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties.  Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air.
"
8,7,Cartman,"Look, it's working! 
"
3,15,Cartman,"that's why they're lame.
"
14,4,Stan,"Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend.
"
15,9,Butters,"We're crossin' the border!
"
5,7,Mr. Mackey,"Uh not me!  Huhuh, okay.
"
3,4,Kyle,"Yeah. See, we got you to fight just 'cause we wanted to see who was the toughest. We made up all that stuff we said to get you guys mad at each other. 
"
8,1,Kyle,"Oh dude, we are gonna get it now.
"
16,5,Kyle,"Do you really think that this is good for Butters? To have his face put up all over signs as the poster child for bullying?
"
2,14,Stan,"Elton John! What are you doing here?
"
17,7,Cartman,"What new Elmo doll?
"
2,11,Stan,"Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
"
8,10,Kyle,"Do you know how to start a fire?
"
12,1,Cartman,"...No, as a matter of fact, Jimmy Buffett came instead.  Oh yeah, it's real fuckin' funny, Kyle!
"
17,6,Stan,"Hey Kyle.
"
14,1,Kyle,"I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
"
4,12,Stan,"...nine, eight...
"
1,1,Wendy,"Come on, Stan. 
"
9,9,Butters,"N'aw geez! Now I'm gonna get grounded, too.
"
7,13,Mr. Mackey,"You're right, boys, m'kay?
"
11,1,Cartman,"Oh. Did I hurt his little feelings? 
"
5,12,Mr. Garrison,"Look, there's more of them moving into our town.  You know, Oprah Winfrey is building a house up on Cannon, and some Snoop Doggy Doo Doo buildin' a gigantic place up on Main.
"
3,2,Kyle,"How stupid do you think we are?! Now you die on that cross and get resurrurected before I kick your ass!
"
7,3,Cartman,"They did?
"
11,3,Kyle,"What's this about, Cartman? 
"
14,7,Butters,"I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance.  Towelie! Open the door!
"
17,9,Kyle,"Stan?
"
9,10,Wendy,"Stan, I'm sorry I doubted you. You really made a great dad.
"
12,1,Cartman,"No, no, listen, Kyle! I'm on to something. There really is hope.
"
13,6,Randy,"We will give you a call!
"
3,2,Randy,"Right.
"
3,9,Kyle,"That's you, Kenny. Raise your hand. 
"
8,11,Stan,"Your idea took about this much thought, Craig! 
"
3,13,Cartman,"You shut up,  ass-logger!
"
16,13,Stan,"You're wearing a bracelet to think of me?
"
2,3,Kyle,"Come on, dumbass, you can do it!
"
9,7,Jimmy,"I'm trying to get laid. What's it look like?
"
1,10,Stan,"Did the Devil show up yet?
"
11,6,Stan,"That's it, that's the whole story?
"
16,2,Stan,"Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
"
10,10,Kyle,"You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break,  and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! 
"
8,7,Stan,"Night, Mom.  Wow, two people from the future. How cool.
"
13,5,Mr. Garrison,"Hey, hey Mackey? Do you like fishsticks?
"
15,8,Kyle,"Why?! So that we can lose our business and everything can go back to old times?!
"
7,15,Kyle,"All right! We're going to Canada!
"
1,8,Cartman,"We found a Etheropian, can we keep him?
"
2,3,Randy,"Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!
"
10,9,Mr. Mackey,"Excuse me!! Could we get back to the issue, please?! You all don't seem to understand how serious this is!! Now who made dookie in the urinal?!  Oh, you think it's funny, huh?! M'kay! M'kay! You're gonna think it's real funny when the police get here!
"
15,8,Wendy,"I don't know what to do. It's like he's... completely turned off.
"
3,16,Cartman,"Hey, Las Vegas is a pretty cool place for us mature people. 
"
12,7,Cartman,"Butters Butters, calm down! I know a way out of this!
"
11,13,Kyle,"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet.
"
7,10,Cartman,"Looks like Stan's dad's been hittin' the bottle again.
"
6,10,Cartman,"Two weeks isn't enough. I'm not over our teacher's tragic death. I'm still sh-shooken up.
"
8,10,Stan,"Calm down guys, we don't have to go tell our parents. We just need to go out and get some protection.
"
4,13,Mr. Garrison,"What the hell is that?  Oh my God! What is that thing? Children, there's some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom!  Oh my God, it's awful! It's coming for the door. 
"
2,12,Mr. Mackey,"Oh, your parents are here.
"
5,11,Kyle,"I don't know about this guys. I think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous.
"
9,2,Cartman,"Let me guess: they've started a hippie jam band music festival.
"
7,1,Cartman,"This is so awesome. I don't think I made it out of that proctologist's office, guys. I think I died and went to heaven.
"
6,3,Cartman,"Butters, you have screwed me out of a prize for the last time! 
"
8,6,Stan,"What's that you're wearing?
"
18,10,Cartman,"NOOOO! 
"
3,7,Cartman,"Huh?! 
"
11,13,Stan,"Then let's go, dude! 
"
3,4,Stan,"Hi. We're here to visit our good friends, Tweek and Craig.
"
7,7,Randy,"Yes. Yes, of course. Quickly, Stan, we must give it to everyone! 
"
13,5,Cartman,"Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke!  ""Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?"" There! 
"
15,7,Stan,"Uh that sounds like shit too.
"
6,7,Cartman,"Look at me, livin' free
Free and clean amongst the Sea People
''We look for pirates and search for gold.
Life is an adventure with the Sea People
They don't ever complain, they don't call me fat.
They don't make me do homework or nothin' like that.
This is the way life was meant to be. Laughin' and singing,
Sea people and me.
Sea people and me, you guys.
"
3,6,Mr. Garrison,"Okay, children, let's all take our seats. We have a lot to learn today.  Oohh-kay. Uh, Clyde, can you tell me when Ulysses S. Grant was president?
"
11,5,Stan,"I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
"
8,13,Cartman,"And now, again, one man's vision ushers in a new era of aerial travel, proving the power of imagination and intellect. The magic... of flight! 
"
11,9,Randy,"Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke!  Don't touch me! 
"
16,2,Stan,"...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
"
3,4,Cartman,"'Cause we have ten bucks riding on it.
"
6,16,Stan,"They didn't come back to the past, you dumbass, they're actors!
"
15,11,Randy,"Sorry! Sorry.
"
16,2,Cartman,"No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!
"
13,5,Kyle,"What?
"
17,6,Kyle,"Hello, Stan.
"
3,3,Cartman,"Why? I'll tell you why! Because he's a God-damned asshole, aaand, that's about it!
"
1,5,Kyle,"Hey Chef.
"
8,2,Cartman,"...How should I know? I'm retarded. Daaaaa!
"
8,5,Butters,"Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. 
"
4,12,Kyle,"Oh no! What have we done?!
"
6,7,Butters,"Dwaah!!
"
1,1,Kyle,"Damn it, he's still there.
"
2,11,Mr. Garrison,"I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.
"
5,1,Kyle,"Oh, whatever. 
"
6,12,Kyle,"What does me being a Jew have to do with anything?!
"
4,8,Wendy,"Thanks for coming over, Bebe. I have something to tell you.
"
3,14,Randy,"Hey, uh, I shot you, Ned. You have to fall down.
"
3,1,Mr. Mackey,"I think this will be very good for you 
"
4,9,Cartman,"...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--
"
6,13,Butters,"Wha-wha, what are you doing?! 
"
2,7,Stan,"What?
"
11,4,Kyle,"I guess so.
"
16,13,Stan,"Pff, there's there's farmers in Belarus who are in a life and death struggle. THAT's what should be important!
"
4,8,Mr. Garrison,"But they're electing a new assistant to the Grand Dragon. I might get elected.
"
15,2,Butters,"Mr. Sandler says you'd better get it done! And Token says to hurry because he's runnin' out of money.
"
9,10,Stan,"Kyle??
"
3,14,Kyle,"You're not supposed to rock, you're supposed to keep the beat!
"
1,13,Kyle,"Yeah. This is like the third day in a row. I wonder what's wrong
"
11,7,Randy,"What are they doing?  Don't leave us!
"
2,15,Stan,"But MOM!
"
5,8,Kyle,"Agh! Look, dude, we're on level 24, about to cross into the Caverns of Madness!
"
17,1,Cartman,"What, they already have something better than Twitter?
"
13,5,Jimmy,"Well, we, we were just talking about ideas for jokes and then-
"
13,13,Cartman,"""Or does she?"" See, that's a question. I'm asking questions, Stan! I've called for Wendy to come on my show and defend herself, but she won't do it!
"
2,11,Mr. Mackey,"Eric, you really saved the day. Mkay?
"
3,8,Randy,"AAAW!! 
"
6,13,Kyle,"Hide! 
"
6,15,Stan,"Now do you people believe me?
"
6,16,Stan,"What?
"
9,7,Cartman,"No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. 
"
10,8,Stan,"Kyle!  Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?
"
16,8,Butters,"I got the balloon, Coach Marsh. Er, what should I do with it?
"
1,13,Stan,"Dude! The bus will be here any minute, and Cartman didn't show up for school.
"
3,5,Cartman,"Okay.
"
16,7,Cartman,"Dude, I'm being seriously. You guys will be really cute together. What are you gonna say to her?
"
12,9,Cartman,"Yeah, I'm just gonna teach her a lesson. I'm not gonna totally... kick her ass. 
"
4,15,Stan,"Chef, what's a prostitute?
"
14,9,Randy,"Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. 
"
6,10,Cartman,"Yeah, have a seat, Tweek. We all need to have a talk
"
9,13,Cartman,"Why?
"
4,15,Kyle,"Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!
"
7,15,Kyle,"But why are you making such strange laws??
"
15,1,Kyle,"Hey! Hey, let me out of here! This is a mistake! I agreed by accident!
"
3,13,Kyle,"What??
"
11,8,Cartman,"Hm. That was... weird.
"
6,2,Stan,"...who are you people?!
"
5,8,Kyle,"Uh no.
"
12,9,Cartman,"I want to apologize, and tell you that... I'm sorry for what I said. Okay? It was wrong of me, and I promise you that it won't happen again. I don't wanna fight you after school, all right? So, I'm sorry.
"
12,6,Randy,"Our house... It has no Internet.
"
16,5,Mr. Mackey,"Attention students: today we will have an... assembly... on the subject of... bullying. M'kay?  The assembly is mandatory. M'kay? You'd better show up. 'Kay?
"
6,4,Butters,"Hey, look. Some other kids are doin' the same thing we are.  Eugh
"
3,15,Stan,"I'll try
"
13,6,Randy,"Will you just relax, Finland?! Nobody is gonna find out anything.
"
8,2,Cartman,"...I'll split the money with you. 
"
16,12,Kyle,"Dude, if these guys are as bad as you say, then we have to do something!
"
6,13,Cartman,"Kevin, god-damnit..! 
"
16,3,Kyle,"So, what do you want to do now?
"
5,6,Kyle,"Your grandma left it to you! You didn't earn it!
"
16,8,Butters,"And when that other team tries to cover you, well that's when you gotta reach deep down. Right down to your creamy center. Well that place, well that place inside of you where, where all the goouey happy-lovin' goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest, most compassionate player you've ever been, and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy!
"
12,8,Stan,"Come on!
"
10,10,Kyle,"Yes.
"
10,8,Randy,"Staaan.  I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son.
"
4,6,Kyle,"Wow. Your mom's pregnant, Kenny.
"
10,8,Kyle,"Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. 
"
9,10,Kenny,"(So?)
"
10,1,Kyle,"The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this- fruity little club!
"
3,7,Cartman,"Aw, man, you guys suck.
"
3,14,Cartman,"We can't go home, we have to take Fort Sumter! 
"
7,12,Randy,"Yeah, are you Mr. Harrison?
"
17,7,Cartman,"Oh uh, hey guys, what's up?
"
3,4,Kyle,"There. Did you see? He just flipped you off.
"
4,9,Randy,"It's obvious to me, girl
"
17,6,Cartman,"Ohh my God!  Ms. Broflovski, are you okay? Does he always talk to you like that?
"
6,2,Butters,"So where's the part where we have a good time?
"
2,17,Cartman,"No it isn't, you guys!
"
18,7,Kyle,"Kyle.
"
1,10,Cartman,"Here you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...
"
16,10,Stan,"Cartman dude, not now.
"
14,4,Kyle,"Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?
"
9,14,Stan,"Dad? Where the hell could he have gone??
"
10,9,Kyle,"...Really??
"
8,9,Randy,"Stan! One family buying one glass isn't gonna make a difference!
"
14,9,Cartman,"Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?!  Hey, Kyle.  Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh.  We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up.
"
3,13,Butters,"Eh, he said he'd hang out with me! 
"
7,3,Kyle,"Noo, I'll just... be... going back to bed now.
"
10,6,Randy,"Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention.
"
2,13,Kyle,"What are we gonna do with them?
"
1,9,Kyle,"Go away, Mr. Hankey.
"
15,6,Butters,"Goodnight, Butters. Hmm. Alright, I guess I'm goin' to fast-forward.  Dr. Janus? 
"
1,2,Wendy,"Hi guys.
"
2,3,Stan,"I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.
"
3,15,Kyle,"Oh! Hey Cartman. We're playing dreidel; you wanna try?
"
12,7,Kenny,"(God damn it, someone help me!)
"
4,15,Kyle,"What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
"
6,16,Stan,"Here it is. Motivation Corp. 
"
9,4,Cartman,"Friday?! Aw, Jesus!  I'll just... sort of get in here- in here. 
"
7,14,Kyle,"No dude, I'm out. Go talk to her yourself. Be poetic. 
"
1,3,Cartman,"Goddammit, don't shoot me!
"
3,3,Kyle,"Here! Here! Look at this. It says ""The succubus enchants its victim with an eerie melody. This is the Succubi power. Only playing this melody backwards can vanquish the succubus power.""
"
1,11,Wendy,"Hi, Stan.
"
10,7,Cartman,"Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!
"
16,5,Stan,"What's up, Kyle? Why are you trying to trash-talk our theatrical release?
"
4,10,Cartman,"Yeah. 
"
11,13,Kyle,"What are you doing here? 
"
8,5,Butters,"Yeah! And I videotaped him doing it!
"
12,1,Cartman,"Oh nice, Butters, you big tattle-tale. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?
"
4,17,Stan,"1  2.
"
4,1,Butters,"Yeah. Why, we sure-uh gave those skanky bitches what for!
"
10,8,Randy,"You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?
"
2,13,Cartman,"Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt! 
"
16,2,Stan,"Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"...there we go. Now, the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth, as such.  Put the four together and we're ready to go. 
"
11,14,Wendy,"I don't think so! 
"
2,15,Kyle,"Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Dude! 
"
18,6,Jimmy,"Alright alright! I never played it. I stay away from the stuff.
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh. Well, alright then. Well, see ya at home. 
"
7,11,Kyle,"Eh... hey, Cartman?  You really don't care that you can't go?
"
1,11,Kenny,"(And did you stick it in right when the fireplace gave you the shadow light?)
"
3,1,Kenny,"(Kenny!)
"
17,9,Stan,"Alright, guys. Looks like we have a wedding to plan. 
"
14,8,Kenny,"(HA! You fucking lose!)
"
3,2,Kyle,"Dude, this is great! You know all the Stations of the Cross, right, Stan?
"
7,9,Stan,"Hm. Guess he got what he deserved. 
"
9,3,Stan,"You tell 'em, Kyle!
"
7,8,Stan,"Yeah. It's cool, holmes.
"
3,17,Cartman,"Yes there is! The French experimented with it in World War II!
"
11,5,Kyle,"What happened?
"
11,2,Butters,"Oh boy!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Hello. Hello, polie. Hello, polie hurrah you soldier boy. Hey, soldier boy!
"
8,11,Stan,"No, but don't you see? We didn't think it was great before. I think I understand now.  I think I know why Craig's show gets such great ratings! Half the school is high on cough medicine!
"
3,10,Cartman,"Me, too.  I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause-- 
"
16,7,Cartman,"I want to hold you every morning and love you every night, Kyle. I promise you nothing but love and happiness.
I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky 
I'll be there, Kyle
I swear  like a shadow that's by your side
Kyle, swear to God I'll be there.
For better or worse , till death do us part 
I'll love you with  every gay beat of my heart!
"
2,15,Stan,"Wow!
"
15,4,Randy,"Burn it down! 
"
12,6,Stan,"What?
"
10,4,Kyle,"You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!
"
18,8,Cartman,"Five darrar? 
"
14,3,Cartman,"You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
"
4,11,Cartman,"Today is another day! And that's another dollar the Lord needs from you-uh! So come on up and give to the Lord-uh! 
"
6,4,Cartman,"What? Why?
"
13,1,Stan,"So how did it go last night? 
"
7,9,Cartman,"No no! Haven't you guys ever seen an album cover? You're supposed to be standing in random places, looking away like you don't care! 
"
3,3,Kyle,"All right, mister! You better have a good explanation for why you didn't show up to play ball!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Ey! Seriously, dude! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!  Mother f- 
"
8,7,Randy,"Hey, Mr. Nelson.
"
10,6,Cartman,"I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! 
"
17,9,Cartman,"Yes, that's true, but, let's face Sir Stan. This is all about you and me getting PlayStations. The rest are simply there to help us... get through-
"
4,14,Timmy,"Gobbles!
"
7,5,Cartman,"S'aright.
"
7,9,Randy,"Ooohhh, I thought a group of Vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths. 
"
3,11,Kyle,"I told you Tom Brokaw doesn't have a mustache, fatass!
"
16,8,Randy,"Oh yeah, I've totally got time to do that, Sharon! In fact, how about I go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you? Check that: a seven-course meal?
"
5,12,Cartman,"Ey, you did me already!
"
7,4,Cartman,"Ah, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, you're just in time.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Oh man! 
"
2,6,Kenny,"(Yeah, it's like killing a dead pig and a turkey.) 
"
16,5,Butters,"Please, leave me alone.
"
6,16,Stan,"You guys, those commercials are just exaggerations.
"
13,5,Cartman,"Hey Jimmy, what are you up to? 
"
13,8,Kyle,"Go on by, Michael. 
"
4,9,Randy,"Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall.
"
1,3,Stan,"Maybe your mom can give me a kiss too, Cartman.
"
3,12,Stan,"No!  A dead body.
"
12,1,Cartman,"No- No way. I'm not going to the hospital, Mom!
"
6,9,Cartman,"He... killed... twenty-three babies in self-defense?
"
18,6,Kyle,"Wuh, what's done?
"
18,5,Butters,"You do?
"
7,14,Butters,"Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.
"
2,7,Kenny,"(Heheheh. Now that's what I-he call a sticky situation!) 
"
7,11,Cartman,"We can't come down there, or else, we'll contaminate you, Butters. No... we just have to survive the best we can. 
"
4,11,Cartman,"Dude, if God is all-understanding, he wouldn't send us to hell. Even Sister Anne told me that.
"
10,14,Stan,"But what can I do?
"
8,6,Cartman,"Deeper.  Mr. Jefferson, I wish I could be around you all the time. You're awesome.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Come on!
"
2,6,Mr. Garrison,"No, I wasn't in Vietnam, but sometimes, I like to pretend I was. Anyway, children, I'm going to assign you all a paper.
"
2,13,Kyle,"No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls.
"
2,13,Kyle,"He still thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Oh my God! Look at his leg!
"
2,16,Kyle,"I don't know. Ever since he was in that movie, he got all famous.
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Yes!
"
4,8,Wendy,"Hey, that's what I always do, too!
"
1,5,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, well then I guess you get an 'F'.  Okay, Terrance, I know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project.
"
7,8,Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAAAAH!
"
2,9,Cartman,"I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!
"
6,9,Stan,"You mean, you just came because you believe in our cause?
"
7,14,Butters,"Darling!
"
6,1,Stan,"That's right! So now you can pay us to use him in your commercials and you'll have your very own Jared!
"
8,12,Wendy,"But the idea that we'll be whorish for money is belittling to our gender!
"
15,8,Stan,"...Enchirito?
"
8,6,Cartman,"No! I am sick and tired of people harassing Mr. Jefferson!  All I've been hearing since Mr. Jefferson moved here are sick lies! That he molests children, that he's a bad father, that he has plastic surgery!
"
1,7,Kyle,"Dude, it can't be cooler than mine.
"
13,10,Stan,"If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!
"
1,8,Cartman,"Oh yeah, you're right.  Are you gonna eat all of your peach cobbler? No, you don't want all that, why don't you share it with me, man?  Just slide that right on over here. Let me just have some of that here...
"
10,10,Cartman,"Aw Goddamnit!
"
2,8,Stan,"Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.
"
8,10,Cartman,"It's true.
"
13,10,Cartman,"You're just gonna have to deal with that.
"
15,6,Mr. Mackey,"Okay, kids, today we have a special assembly, m'kay. Today we're going to learn about ""the diversity of Asian people."" Please welcome Mr. Lu Kim and Mr. Junichi Takiyama. 
"
7,9,Cartman,"I don't wanna be in your crappy band, guys. I just wanted to let you know, the album for my Christian rock band,  Faith + 1, is about to go platinum.
"
10,1,Stan,"Having sex with women.
"
14,3,Cartman,"You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
"
2,6,Cartman,"Son of a bitch.
"
1,10,Cartman,"Yeah. Come on in and join the party. 
"
4,13,Stan,"What do you think, Officer Barbrady?
"
12,1,Cartman,"Yeah, well, at least  it's not as bad as having AIDS. AIDS is the worst disease.
"
1,3,Cartman,"Ah, dude! I'm starting to have flashbacks.
"
4,10,Stan,"Have you confessed all your sins yet?
"
6,13,Stan,"Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!
"
3,5,Stan,"Oh, no! Nothing's worse than Cartman with authoritah!
"
8,1,Cartman,"Who's gonna tell them, dumbass?!
"
18,8,Kyle,"Yeah, It was seriously the most manly thing that's ever happened.
"
15,4,Randy,"Yeeaahh! 
"
2,15,Stan,"I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
"
2,12,Kyle,"When is Mr. Hat coming back?
"
2,3,Kyle,"Just read the sentence.
"
10,1,Kyle,"All right, come on. 
"
4,12,Stan,"Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there were!
"
17,6,Kenny,"(Dude, maybe he's like mentally ill or something)
"
7,5,Cartman,"Nonono, you're Jennifer Lopez
"
13,7,Butters,"Pirates ho! 
"
10,7,Cartman,"All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you.
"
12,5,Cartman,"Two to nothing, ese! Two to nothing!  How do I reach these keeds?
"
6,10,Mr. Mackey,"M'kay. Wendy, why don't we hear your paper?
"
5,5,Stan,"Yep. Tomorrow night.
"
14,3,Kyle,"So where's the KFC now?
"
12,7,Butters,"Whoa!
"
5,1,Kyle,"No no! The word, ""shit"".
"
18,3,Cartman,"I'm going to the potty.
"
11,4,Cartman,"No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them.
"
10,2,Randy,"Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!
"
6,12,Kyle,"What?? For God's sake, why??
"
7,5,Stan,"What are you gloating about?
"
4,15,Stan,"Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. 
"
8,1,Stan,"Come on, Ninjas! 
"
1,1,Cartman,"Shut up!
"
11,11,Kyle,"Imagina-eh
"
15,14,Cartman,"What is going on here? Mom, what have you done? Were things so bad for you financially you had to turn to a life of crime?! My mom is so poor she uses Cheerios for earrings. Well... guess I'm off to a foster home then.  Hawaii is my first choice. Something not exactly on the beach but maybe just a short walk away?  Gonna take me years to recover from being torn from my mother's arms. Only the ocean breezes and coconut trees can help me now.
"
18,2,Wendy,"I'm happy, Stan. I'm happy I know who you really are now. You're someone who can't be counted on! You're someone who can just bail on the people you love! 
"
16,4,Kyle,"No?
"
6,12,Cartman,"Aw, don't tell me we haven't even reached the cloud city yet!
"
6,7,Stan,"Let's go! 
"
1,7,Kyle,"Yeah, I'm scared.
"
18,6,Kyle,"Hey, uh, Jimmy, can we talk?
"
12,13,Stan,"Look, guys.  The world is changing. We can't fight it, we have to change with it. I've been watching these movies, and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school.  And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals, then think about this: right now,  everyone thinks Butters is way cooler than any of you.
"
8,3,Cartman,"Really? Three hundred million domestic box-office, Kyle. The top-grossing film of all time, Kyle. Those numbers don't lie. If you're not scared of The Passion then go see it. Go see it and tell me I'm wrong. Mel Gibson, Kyle. Mel Gibson.
"
15,9,Stan,"Uh, Butters, I think we're gonna go back to Kyle being team leader.
"
6,16,Stan,"Stop it.
"
2,9,Cartman,"I'll momaymumyeu, Meemuhmammy.
"
3,11,Cartman,"Well, I can't find anything- wait. What's this? 
"
7,8,Mr. Garrison,"Thanks, Jimbo. I really like your outfit, too.  Soho... so Jimbo, you... wanna come back to my place with me and Mr. Slave?
"
17,3,Cartman,"I won't do it! He used to be my friend!
"
5,9,Kyle,"You sonofabitch, Cartman!  You don't fart when you're locked in a small space with other people! 
"
15,10,Cartman,"Boy, I say.
"
15,14,Cartman,"YES! Yeheah, did you hear that Kenny?? We're good! I seriously thought we didn't stand a chance, but now... everything's gonna be okay!
Cause I'm not (I'm not) the poor kid at school!  
Let's hear it for Jacob Hallery, guys! 
His mom is so poor she cuts coupons out to be institutionalized!
Greeley Colorado's the place to be!
It's a whole new beginning for you and me!
Life can only get better 'cause I know one simple ruuule!
I'm not (he's not) the poor kid at school!
"
4,8,Cartman,"Yeah.
"
14,2,Kenny,"(Not yet) 
"
18,7,Cartman,"Even 10% is good enough. Here you go. 
"
3,11,Stan,"Alright, we made it!
"
9,11,Kyle,"Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
"
4,6,Cartman,"Heh, he's such a dumba-a-ass.
"
2,4,Kyle,"AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!! 
"
7,15,Kyle,"We'll get back in time for a Christmas adventure.
"
4,12,Mr. Garrison,"Look, you can't counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, ""Suck my balls,"" you say, ""Present them.""
"
8,3,Stan,"That does it! I'm sick of you guys arguing about The Passion! I'm out of here.
"
8,2,Timmy,"Argh. Jimmy...
"
3,16,Stan,"Yeah, they make you have your puberty quicker. And I'm just here to tell you that my puberty is gonna be bigger than any of you guys's!
"
16,5,Stan,"No.
"
5,8,Cartman,"Could you turn it up?
"
13,9,Butters,"Oh, oh.  Oh jeez. 
"
11,10,Kyle,"What did they say??
"
2,12,Kyle,"Okay.
"
7,15,Kyle,"You... bastards!  Wha, what the hell is wrong with you?? What kind of Prime Minister bases his decisions on hatred?  And, and takes away mounties' horses?  And French people's wine? What the hell kind of Prime Minister are you, anyway?!
"
4,3,Stan,"I don't know.  Whoa. 
"
11,13,Butters,"He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero.  Come on, Stan! You got it!
"
9,7,Cartman,"Aaagh!
"
14,1,Kyle,"I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?
"
15,13,Cartman,"Non! Mom, did you already get stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner?
"
18,5,Butters,"If this doesn't work, we're dead.
"
7,12,Cartman,"Ohhh, here's Stan's little girlfriend now.
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Well Kyle, that's kind of odd. Uh, not sure how to help you with that.
"
8,8,Cartman,"Hey, fuck off, Kyle.  Don't let them intimidate you, Stan. I'll help walk you to the booth. And then I'm gonna buy you a nice steak dinner with all the trimmings.
"
7,1,Cartman,"Ohhh no no nonono! Nobody is putting their finger in my ass again! Unless it's Kyle. 
"
8,10,Kyle,"So you're gonna help us?
"
16,2,Butters,"Oh sorry, sorry. 
"
1,1,Kyle,"What's an anal probe?
"
6,10,Cartman,"Woohoo.
"
3,2,Kyle,"Yeah. 
"
9,8,Randy,"Ladies and Gentlemen, if Global Warming has in fact already caused the Beaverton flood, then this is only the beginning. The effects are going to spread. What we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which we've never seen. 
"
9,10,Stan,"That's because I was pissed off!
"
2,5,Stan,"Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
"
5,2,Timmy,"Ah.
"
2,4,Kyle,"Why bad?
"
4,17,Stan,"Aren't you Jewish, Kyle?
"
1,2,Stan,"Yeah, it was huge.
"
17,7,Stan,"There has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side. 
"
5,1,Stan,"They can't say ""shit"" on television!
"
2,16,Cartman,"Yuhwell, you're not dreaming!  Ey! Cut the crap!
"
3,1,Cartman,"It's bad! It's a bad three-toed sloth!
"
9,10,Stan,"Well guess what?! I'm gonna take this egg to class myself! And I'm gonna hold it up in front of Wendy, and say ""See?! I'm every bit as good as Kyle is."" 
"
3,16,Mr. Garrison,"Well, yeah, but that??
"
3,14,Stan,"It's finally over, Cartman. You lost!
"
4,8,Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well, screw you guys, I'm going home! 
"
5,8,Kyle,"We're missing out on some quality video game time right now.
"
5,2,Jimmy,"Timmy? Timmy? I told you to put on the HAT!!  You dirty motherfucker! 
"
2,3,Stan,"Aw, I think that's a mask, dude.
"
4,13,Cartman,"Huh? 
"
2,6,Cartman,"Sweet. Oh, yeah, sweet. That's super sweet. Ah-yes!
"
11,9,Stan,"No, never.
"
17,6,Kyle,"Yes sir.
"
8,10,Stan,"What the hell are we gonna do??
"
10,13,Cartman,"You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-damnit! I am so fucking sick of the future! 
"
7,5,Cartman,"I agree. Those places are stupid.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Okay, how about ... that? 
"
2,14,Stan,"Our friend, Chef.
"
3,13,Cartman,"Egghhh. Dude, home-schooling rules.  Yeeehhhhhhss! 
"
16,6,Kyle,"Wugh!
"
17,7,Stan,"The House of Greyhawk?
"
4,12,Cartman,"Everything was great in third grade. And now that it's all over, we're starting to see just how special it was.
Remember how it used to be in the Third Grade?
We used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the Third Grade
We learned wondrous things from a teacher so nice
Sat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smiles
The world seemed to all make sense
but that sense seems to slowly fade
After Third Grade
In the Third Grade we used to write with crayons
We would make sparkly pictures with glitter and glue
We had warm cookies and hearts full of love
And there wasn't a care in the world of me... of you...
There's not a thing in this life that I wouldn't trade just to go back, for one minute
To Third Grade
"
3,3,Kyle,"This... is insane. 
"
5,9,Stan,"No, dude, we're n- we're not ungrateful. It's just... none of us can keep the goat.
"
17,3,Cartman,"Hey Token. ...Sup bro? ...How's it goin' dude? I know how it feels now.
"
16,1,Cartman,"So then... so then Clyde's mom's ghost was all like ""Clyde, what have I told you Clyde, you asshole!"" And Clyde is all like ""Mom, leave me alone! I'm seriously. Stop, please!"" Dude, it was a riot.
"
6,4,Cartman,"Kiss it. Come on.  Kiss it.
"
18,5,Stan,"What?
"
7,10,Randy,"Well fine. I was gonna bail you out, but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did!
"
14,4,Cartman,"Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off...  That's a dude jacking off...
"
16,6,Stan,"Alright, look, we can make it, you guys. We can't panic. If the four of us don't zipline the tour will move faster. We are gonna make it out of here, okay?
"
7,10,Randy,"They're coming!! Get out of here before they see you! Run to the hills and find a way to fight them! Go!!  Boys, avenger me! AVENGER ME!!
"
9,12,Stan,"What what do I do?
"
17,6,Cartman,"Hey Kyle. Y-you got a minute?
"
6,4,Kyle,"Don't panic. I'll tell you what to say.  You can tell them...
"
3,16,Cartman,"Yeah, you shouldn't force your period, Stan. You should let it come, like the morning dew.
"
3,17,Cartman,"Well, that's fine, that's fine. Next time, just remember that we're all pretty cool on the Westside, too, if you know what I'm saying, 'kay?
"
15,1,Kyle,"(I need some help! I can't take it!)
"
7,11,Kyle,"Yeah, it's pretty cool.
"
15,10,Mr. Mackey,"Alright now, get back to class! Adler, get rid of those laxative bottles! Trash all the Arby's horsey sauce packages too! There cannot be one piece of evidence of what we did here!  What the?  Oh shit!  Stop that rat!
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Well it sounds like he's hittin' puberty.
"
16,6,Stan,"We can take a boat, you guys! We can probably take it all the way back to Fairplay!
"
3,13,Kenny,"(Hey, can I have that?)  (Heey.)
"
7,2,Jimmy,"Well gee, that's really nice of you, Mr. ...Chinese person.  Look Tim-Tim, we got a cash prize. We must be the ...one hundredth customer or something.
"
12,3,Kenny,"(You fucking asshole!)
"
17,3,Cartman,"Oh God here it comes! Get down everybody! Get down now! 
"
3,15,Cartman,"And...
''O Holy Night, the stars are brightly shi-ning
It is the night of our dear Savior's b-b-b-birth
O Holy Night, the- something, something, dis-- aah.
It is the night with the Christmas trees and pie.
Jesus was born, and so I get presents.
Thank you, Jesus, for being born. (Wo-o-o-o-o)
Fall (Fall) 
On your knees (On your knees) 
And hear (Can't you hear)
The angels'.. something (Voices)
O night (O night)
Divine (Divine)
The night
When I get presents (O-o)
O night (O o-night) 
Di-viiine! 
O night (Ooo-ooo)
O night, di-vine! 
Oh. Ah. Ch.
"
13,7,Cartman,"What did I tell you, Butters? This is the good life, huh?  What's going on?
"
1,1,Kyle,"You can't! Poor Ike must be so scared, up there all alone. You gotta help me, dude! 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Polly Prissypants! Rumpertumskin!  Jesus Christ! 
"
1,3,Cartman,"I can shoot you too!
"
3,4,Kenny,"(Hey, God damn it!)
"
6,16,Butters,"I said, I know how you feel. My life has gone completely downhill ever since my future self moved in. I hate him! All he ever wants to do is watch Becker. And that show is so stupid. 
"
8,4,Butters,"Get out of my room, Stan.
"
11,2,Butters,"Hey, fellas! 
"
10,3,Kyle,"What are you talking about?!
"
2,8,Stan,"Hi, Uncle Jimbo.
"
13,11,Cartman,"Our gentle friends of the sea have saved the day. Because they know that only we can save them from the Japanese. 
"
6,7,Kyle,"Ms. Choksondik stinks inside. 
"
4,13,Kyle,"But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper.  It has five different compartments for each subject in school,  and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek.
"
5,13,Kyle,"Hey Cartman.  I care a lot about him, too. 
"
8,11,Cartman,"Kenny, what the hell are you doing with this asshole?!
"
17,7,Jimmy,"Yeah!
"
13,6,Randy,"Whaa-wha-what about it
"
11,9,Randy,"Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?
"
13,7,Kyle,"What? Are you sure?
"
10,6,Kyle,"Dude, what are you doing?
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Yeup.
"
16,9,Cartman,"No! It's okay, Kyle... because... I'm not gonna live like some... slug who can't even leave his house 'cause he can't get around. Now that I can admit I'm fat, I decided to finally do something about it.  Sweeeeeeeeeet!
"
1,12,Stan,"Man, the bus sure is late.
"
1,13,Stan,"Maybe we should ditch school and go check on him. 
"
9,3,Cartman,"We just need a really kickass office and some nice suits. A and a fountain in our lobby. All top agencies have fountains in their lobbies. We gotta make Token think he needs us, when actually he doesn't need us at all. 
"
11,11,Kyle,"Right, then it was ""Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on"" 
"
3,15,Kyle,"Okay, Ike. You're my little brother, so I have to show you how to celebrate Hanukkah.  This is called a dreidel. You spin it and see where it lands. And you sing this song:
I have a little dreidel; I made it out of clay.
And when it's dry and ready, with dreidel I shall play. Oh,
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, with dreidel I shall play.
"
3,2,Kyle,"You're too fat to be Jesus!
"
14,5,Cartman,"So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.
"
3,17,Cartman,"Hey, I found it, you guys! I found it!
"
3,2,Randy,"Awww crap.
"
12,1,Cartman,"Fuck you, Jimmy Buffett! You fuckin' suck!
"
10,4,Cartman,"Dude, can I go before you?
"
5,7,Kyle,"Yeah! You get out of town!
"
6,9,Kyle,"Yeah. I I think so.
"
7,3,Kyle,"Oh.
"
11,13,Cartman,"Real guitars are for old people.
"
11,9,Randy,"Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?!  Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody! 
"
6,5,Cartman,"Butters will give hand jobs in the corner for a dollar.
"
6,4,Kyle,"Come on, we've gotta go!
"
2,5,Stan,"Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter.
"
7,7,Stan,"They, they had it! They freakin' had it!
"
7,5,Cartman,"Not me!
"
17,10,Wendy,"What the fuck is your problem?!
"
16,10,Cartman,"Oh, that is bullshit! Put your manager on!
"
7,3,Kyle,"Oh God! Oh God! I have to tell the truth!  Mooooomm! 
"
15,12,Cartman,"Thank you all so much for coming. I realize that Clyde Frog's death is as shocking to all of you as it is to me.
"
2,7,Cartman,"Mmmm.  Mmmm.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Shh. Okay?! Old people need to be quiet right now!
"
14,9,Butters,"Kyle did that? Gee whiz.
"
6,16,Stan,"We have to teach our parents a lesson! Show them they can't just play with our emotions like that!
"
4,15,Stan,"Well, at least you got it out of your system.
"
16,9,Kyle,"So get off your fucking scooters and pick them up!
"
13,10,Stan,"Yeah!
"
1,1,Cartman,"Shut up, dude, you're being totally immature.
"
15,8,Kyle,"Oh God! Look, I know you got Asperger's from the school and I I'm sorry. But your negativity is poison to me!
"
3,17,Mr. Garrison,"Face it, Mother. He never abused me! 
"
6,8,Cartman,"Yes!! Yes, I DID IT!! I crapped out my mouth!  I crapped out my mo-outh!  You owe me twenty bucks, dickface!
"
2,15,Cartman,"Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!
"
18,10,Kyle,"It's the holiday season, but the good times... are ending.Because what matters most isn't what's good, it's what's trending.
This younger generation, with their eyes and ears glued:
What's trending to them is trenders who trend on YouTube.
"
9,10,Stan,"Uh huh...
"
8,10,Cartman,"How the hell are condoms gonna help us?!  Sorry, heh. Never mind, hehe. 
"
2,9,Kyle,"Huh??
"
15,12,Cartman,"AAAAHAA! AAHAAAA! Rumpertumskin!! RUMPER  Rumpertumskin... WHY? Why did you do this??
"
7,11,Butters,"Aw man.
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"See, that's what you get when you raise your child to be a pagan.
"
1,4,Cartman,"Ah, dammit!
"
17,5,Mr. Mackey,"Sorry, Kyle, we're gonna need to maybe go somewhere else. Uh... find an IntelliLink panel somewhere.
"
16,1,Kyle,"What's going on?
"
6,1,Cartman,"Row you fat bitch! Look at those jelly rolls! Nobody loves you! You're not even a person!
"
5,13,Stan,"Oh dude, there goes one.
"
6,12,Kyle,"Okay. N-no, ah I don't want that much responsibility-bility. Here, you hold on to it, Kenny. 
"
2,18,Stan,"I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean.  Wait. 
"
1,3,Cartman,"I am Scuzzlebutt, Lord of the Mountains. Behold my Patrick Duffy leg.
"
12,3,Cartman,"Cat pee? 
"
17,1,Butters,"That's right.
"
11,4,Cartman,"That's funny.
"
10,9,Kyle,"They are?
"
3,13,Kenny,"(Hey!)  (Hey, Cartman, help me.)
"
15,10,Cartman,"It doesn't matter. Enough students will crap their pants to make everyone forget about Pete Melman and Jenny Simons forever.
"
7,11,Cartman,"All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.
"
8,3,Stan,"It's our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!
"
16,1,Randy,"No, I was talking to my asshole. C-C'mon, asshole. Let's get back to work. 
"
12,8,Cartman,"Shoot him, Butters!
"
15,4,Cartman,"My penis is 13 inches long.
"
1,8,Kyle,"Then you take care of him.
"
5,14,Butters,"Yeah. I could use some God-damned poontang myself right now. Have you ever been to Bennigan's, Mister? Oh, it sure is great. I'm goin' to Bennigan's tomorrow night with my family. Oh, I can just see it now.  We'll walk in the front doors,  and the nice Bennigan's hostess lady will take us to our cozy booth  Then we'll order some mozzarella sticks, for appetizers.  Dad will open his present, and Mom will open hers  Uh then the Bennigan's wait staff will sing
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
''
Happy Happy Anniversary-eh from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Happy Anniversary from everyone at Bennigan's
Happy Ha- Whoa, are we stoppin' for sodas? Hey, can I have chocolate milk?  He must like TGI Fridays.
"
5,14,Butters,"Oh, you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin' ""nutsack"" in front of Grandma. Yeah, I need to behave myself.
"
3,11,Kyle,"Which button did you press, Cartman??
"
8,4,Stan,"Leopold Stotch...? Wait a minute. You mean...
"
5,9,Stan,"Yeah, they told us in school that everyone but terrorists love America.
"
9,5,Stan,"No!
"
15,5,Cartman,"Just sign the paper and he'll be playing ball for St. Mary's.
"
16,2,Cartman,"""My arms hurt."" Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! 
"
6,5,Kyle,"They were wearing cowboy hats!  Did you see??  Did you see?? 
"
7,1,Kyle,"Weird
"
5,5,Cartman,"Look, Kenny, everything turned out okay!
"
11,2,Cartman,"Hang on a second here. 
"
10,12,Cartman,"Who are they??
"
10,4,Cartman,"You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy.
"
13,10,Stan,"It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene. 
"
16,2,Cartman,"Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth.
"
10,10,Kyle,"Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"Now it's got to be simple. Like a moped, but with the ability to travel at much faster speeds. The designs of our electrical moped were altered with a- no, nonono this won't work either!
"
18,2,Kyle,"Hey, we'd do anything for our bros, man.
"
6,5,Cartman,"Yeah, it sure does!
"
14,2,Cartman,"Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters.
"
10,8,Kyle,"If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!
"
7,15,Stan,"Cartman, calm down!
"
8,10,Kyle,"Oh, no! No!
"
2,13,Cartman,"Oh come on, you guys. We still have plenty of money left over.
"
5,13,Butters,"Eric says you gotta come to his house right away.
"
13,14,Jimmy,"You've gotta swim over here, Kyle.
"
13,9,Butters,"Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!
"
18,3,Randy,"I like the women's bathroom. I feel safe there. Being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity, to my music.
"
3,10,Stan,"Yeah, like ancient history.
"
7,11,Kyle,"You guys! You guys! I have awesome news!
"
15,14,Cartman,"I'm not saying it.
"
3,10,Cartman,"I haven't made any money yet.
"
7,7,Kyle,"What?! Get the hell out of here!
"
8,8,Stan,"I guess... 
"
4,3,Cartman,"Yeah!
"
16,10,Stan,"Well are you gonna tell your dad?
"
10,10,Butters,"Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle?  Yes I do think so.
"
10,13,Kyle,"... Uh huh.
"
4,7,Stan,"Oh my God!
"
2,15,Cartman,"NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!!  Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude.
"
13,8,Kyle,"Ike! Ike! Wake up buddy! Wake up! Ike, you've gotta wake up, please!  Eh there you go. That's good.  Oh Ike. I thought I lost you, little brother.
"
4,10,Stan,"I don't know. You can't see him; it's just some anonymous guy.
"
3,16,Kyle,"Yeah! I could just say I got my period! It's not like they'll check. I can just say I got my period, 'cause I really will get it someday! It's not really lying, it's just jumping the gun a little.
"
1,4,Stan,"What's a - homosexual?
"
2,15,Stan,"It was the fish! 
"
14,4,Stan,"No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it.
"
2,12,Cartman,"Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack? 
"
12,7,Stan,"What?!
"
1,9,Mr. Garrison,"The Mr. Hankey song-how does that go?
"
17,6,Mr. Mackey,"Well... why do you like his farts in your tummy?
"
7,6,Kyle,"But the window isn't locked.
"
13,12,Cartman,"God damn it, why is it every time we try to have a relaxing day a bunch of asshole on their Harley motorcycles show up?! 
"
3,2,Kenny,"(Yeah, you guys. Seriously.)
"
12,8,Butters,"Why are they gonna kill my parents?
"
5,8,Stan,"Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. 
"
3,7,Cartman,"That's how it goes in the Wild Wild West. 
"
8,11,Kyle,"Stan?  Dude, Stan, you all right?
"
4,17,Stan,"Stan: I don't know what to do, dude. Who should we help?
Cartman: I say we help Santa Claus!
"
2,2,Cartman,"Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done.
"
2,7,Kyle,"Oh no!
"
9,5,Cartman,"All right, we did it! 
"
3,2,Cartman,"Well, get me down from here!
"
6,3,Cartman,"Oh. Hey, I'm out of control!
"
8,10,Stan,"That's true.
"
16,7,Cartman,"I don't know, it's just so... perfect. 
"
5,5,Stan,"Because I had an itch up my ass.
"
2,11,Cartman,"Hey, there it is!
"
10,3,Kyle,"I'm set! Let's do this!
"
2,7,Stan,"Hoh boy, we're in big trouble.
"
1,7,Kyle,"There's a bunch of zombies here!
"
15,7,Randy,"City bog. Too much, too much city bop. Too much too much too much 
"
4,16,Butters,"I think I found the problem, ma'am. A broken window roller-upper.
"
9,12,Stan,"Cult? Scientology isn't a cult, Kyle. I've read all this stuff and it's based on fact.
"
11,12,Cartman,"We had a DEAL KYLE!
"
16,5,Mr. Mackey,"Uhokay, but uh, today's actually bad. Uh I already have an assembly today on positive thinking.
"
12,9,Stan,"Ugh, I'm glad that's over with.
"
16,12,Kyle,"Oh my God!
"
14,3,Randy,"Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival...
"
6,15,Cartman,"Kenny. Can't have Kenny.
"
8,4,Stan,"Yeah, let's go race it right now!
"
9,4,Stan,"Don't kill Kenny!
"
8,5,Cartman,"Not cool! Totally lame! 
"
13,6,Randy,"When you tell them you only used the approved kit, don't look up and away, don't rub your neck, and don't touch your ear. Otherwise they'll know you're lying to them. Alright? Whenever you need to lie, just don't look up and away, rub your neck, or touch your ear.
"
9,9,Stan,"We risked everything to get it from the girls. How long before the girls attack us to get it back?
"
7,3,Cartman,"I just wanted to see how you're doing, Kyle. Why don't we go out for a little boat ride?
"
10,9,Kyle,"There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.
"
4,10,Cartman,"Yeah, and then this other time, I went pee-pee in the holy water thing, and the priest blessed himself on the forehead with it every day for about a week.  And then this one time, I was at the park, and the priest was out walking his dog and I went-... number two on the sidewalk and then told Officer Barbrady that it was the priest's dog.  And so the priest got find like a hundred dollars for not cleaning it up. And then this one time, I put super glue all over the priest's bottle of-  -eh- Ow!  D'ow! Jesus! Ooww-ah! Ow!  Eh! Oh! Help.  Oh! Somebody help! God damnit! Let me out of here!
"
11,3,Cartman,"I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!
"
4,7,Stan,"My friend is gonna die! He's gonna die and there's nothing I can do about it.  Oh, God, he's my best friend... 
"
9,2,Randy,"Somebody's gonna have to go outside and activate the backup boosters.
"
11,1,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah yeah, we we get it, Mr. Nelson.
"
15,4,Randy,"And we want-
"
8,7,Randy,"All we can do is try, Harrison.
"
1,3,Cartman,"Hey, wait, aah!
"
1,6,Mr. Garrison,"Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.
"
8,5,Butters,"Well you go ahead and relax, AWESOM-O. We've got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow.
"
7,10,Cartman,"So our only solution is to cut off their life force.
"
3,6,Stan,"Please, Sexual Harassment Panda. People listen to you. You have to get them to stop suing each other.
"
2,13,Stan,"He really wants those dolls.
"
11,7,Cartman,"Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
"
3,2,Cartman,"I'm gonna be Jesus!
"
14,10,Stan,"I think I have a better idea.
"
16,1,Kyle,"That's not what she said. You're putting extras on again. It's not that funny.
"
11,7,Stan,"We, just came to ask a question.
"
5,11,Mr. Garrison,"What? Well of course I didn't make it. The line to check in was two hours long, and the security line was two hours more!
"
7,11,Jimmy,"Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock.
"
13,8,Stan,"Accept it! 
"
3,11,Kenny,"(Oh my God, I get it.)
"
2,6,Kyle,"Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?
"
2,3,Cartman,"Goody two-shoes.
"
18,6,Randy,"Told ya. Kid's got demons. I don't do that. 
"
