10,1,Cartman,"Reverse to you, Jew. 
"
10,1,Kyle,"Chef! I can't believe you're back!
"
10,1,Stan,"But are you back for good?
"
10,1,Randy,"Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply.  Right?
"
10,1,Kyle,"Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef.
"
10,1,Cartman,"Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again.
"
10,1,Stan,"What?
"
10,1,Kyle,"Like what?
"
10,1,Butters,"What's a pedophile?
"
10,1,Stan,"NO!
"
10,1,Kyle,"Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!
"
10,1,Kyle,"Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex.
"
10,1,Stan,"Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
"
10,1,Kyle,"...Dude!
"
10,1,Stan,"Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr.
"
10,1,Kyle,"No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.
"
10,1,Kyle,"We're not going anywhere without Chef.
"
10,1,Stan,"NO! 
"
10,1,Cartman,"A mountain lion! 
"
10,1,Randy,"Yeah.
"
10,1,Mr. Mackey,"He's right. 
"
10,2,Kyle,"Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?
"
10,2,Randy,"The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!
"
10,2,Kyle,"Righ!  Okay, good.
"
10,2,Kyle,"What??
"
10,2,Butters,"Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle.
"
10,2,Stan,"Going away party? What do you mean?
"
10,2,Stan,"Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!
"
10,2,Stan,"Where's the going-away party?
"
10,2,Cartman,"Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! 
"
10,2,Stan,"I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways.
"
10,2,Cartman,"THAT's gay, heh.
"
10,2,Stan,"Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!
"
10,2,Butters,"Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew. 
"
10,2,Stan,"Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now.
"
10,2,Randy,"I know! It's like ""Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl""
"
10,2,Randy,"At least we're smart enough to know better!
"
10,2,Stan,"What?!
"
10,2,Stan,"Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.
"
10,2,Kyle,"Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff.
"
10,2,Butters,"Yeah. You're right. 
"
10,2,Cartman,"The smug?
"
10,2,Stan,"What about San Francisco?
"
10,2,Randy,"Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?
"
10,2,Cartman,"You don't know San Francisco, Butters.  It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old.  I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me.  All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.
"
10,2,Kyle,"NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!
"
10,2,Kyle,"Yeah!
"
10,3,Stan,"What?? What??
"
10,3,Stan,"Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!
"
10,3,Randy,"A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character! 
"
10,3,Stan,"Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??
"
10,3,Mr. Mackey,"Wu-we've got the TV working! 
"
10,3,Cartman,"You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?
"
10,3,Kyle,"Hehaha, heh.
"
10,3,Cartman,"Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool.
